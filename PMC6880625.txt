symptoms, such as inattentiveness and behavioral disinhibition, is crucial for
delivering timely assistance and treatment. ADHD is commonly diagnosed and
studied with specialized questionnaires and behavioral tests such as the
stop-signal task. However, in cases of late-onset or mild forms of ADHD,
behavioral measures often fail to gauge the deficiencies well-highlighted by
questionnaires. To improve the sensitivity of behavioral tests, we propose a
novel version of the stop-signal task (SST), which integrates mouse cursor
tracking. In two studies, we investigated whether introducing mouse movement
measures to the stop-signal task improves associations with questionnaire-based
measures, as compared to the traditional (keypress-based) version of SST. We
also scrutinized the influence of different parameters of stop-signal tasks,
such as the method of stop-signal delay setting or definition of response
inhibition failure, on these associations. Our results show that a) SSRT has
weak association with impulsivity, while mouse movement measures have strong and
significant association with impulsivity; b) machine learning models trained on
the mouse movement data from “known” participants using nested cross-validation
procedure can accurately predict impulsivity ratings of “unknown” participants;
c) mouse movement features such as maximum acceleration and maximum velocity are
among the most important predictors for impulsivity; d) using preset stop-signal
delays prompts behavior that is more indicative of impulsivity.

Introduction
The capacity for controlling impulsive behavior (i.e., response inhibition) is
perhaps the most important function in cognitive control. Clinical,
neuropsychological and neuroscientific research suggests that impulsive individuals
are likely to be pathological gamblers [1] and engage in drug or alcohol abuse [2].

Impulsivity can be defined and measured in at least two different ways: as a
preference for earlier but smaller rewards over later and larger rewards (delay
discounting) or as an inability to inhibit undesired actions (behavioral
disinhibition) [3]. The
difference in definitions provides a challenge for clinicians to diagnose their
patients with impulsivity-related disorders such as ADHD
(attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).

Impulsivity is usually studied using different questionnaires (e.g., Behavior Rating
Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)). However, questionnaire-based self-reports
are prone to various biases, such as cultural [4] or learning [5], as well as an inflated relationship between
different facets of executive functioning (i.e., impulsivity and inattention), due
to the questionnaires being developed and validated based on one another [6, 7]. Because of these concerns,
performance-based methods for studying impulsivity have been applied.

One of the most widely-used performance-based methods is the stop-signal task (SST)
[8]. In this task,
individuals respond to the stimuli presented in some trials (“go” trials) and
withhold a response in trials when a “stop” signal appears (“stop” trials). Poor
performance on SST has been related to pathological gambling [9], major depression, anxiety disorder and
conduct disorder [10]. Strong
associations with performance in this task are found with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
and schizophrenia [11, 12, 13].

In addition to simple measures such as response time and accuracy, the stop-signal
task offers stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), which represents the time that an
individual requires to inhibit a “go” response after seeing a “stop” signal. SSRT is
known to reflect an individual’s motor inhibition ability [14]; a slower stop-signal reaction time
corresponds to damage in the right and left inferior frontal gyrus [15, 16], deep brain stimulation of subthalamic
nucleus [17, 18], age-related change in
executive functioning [19],
cocaine abuse [20] and
Parkinson’s disease[21] (for
a more comprehensive review, see [22]). SSRT is generally considered to be the best indicator of ADHD
among all measures of the stop-signal task [8]. Specifically, children with ADHD were shown
to have longer SSRTs [23].

Although SSRT could be applied with healthy individuals to measure the age-related
change in inhibitory control [19] or several other experimental manipulations, SSRT as a sole
diagnostic tool is limited as it is mostly applicable to individuals with severe
clinical disorders. For the general population, the use of this task for clinical
application is rather incomplete as SST has minuscule or non-existent correlations
with questionnaire-based measures particularly when it is applied to mildly impaired
and non-clinical populations [24]. No significant correlations were observed between scores on the
Barrat Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and SSRT [25]. Similarly, no significant correlations
were found between SSRT and questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity, such as the
Eysenck scale, the BRIEF inhibition scale or the ASRS hyperactivity/impulsivity
scale [26]. Correlation
coefficients between questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity and SSRT or other
stop-signal task measures did not exceed .3, with a mean correlation coefficient
equal to .05 [27].

This lack of association between questionnaire-based and performance-based measures
for healthy individuals is problematic because this prevents researchers from
dissecting the functioning of cognitive and affective systems ranging from normal to
abnormal, as these measures are not specific and sensitive enough to tease apart the
nature of impairment and its variability.

Why are performance-based measures, such as SSRT, so poorly correlated with rating
scales? Toplak and colleagues [24] suggest that performance-based tests have poor ecological validity
because these tasks are conducted in highly structured environments, and individuals
tend to display their best, rather than typical, behavior. In contrast,
questionnaires assess typical, everyday behavior. Consequently, performance-based
tasks are not indicative of real-life challenges.

The discrepancy between performance-based tests and questionnaires raises a
fundamental question. Performance-based tests are essential to probe detailed
mechanisms of executive function ranging from normal to abnormal; they offer
well-controlled, objective and reproducible measures of behavior. Yet, this highly
parameterized design deprives its validity to assess human behavior as it occurs in
a natural and typical setting. How can we amend this discrepancy? That is, how can
we make a performance-based test, such as SST, more ecologically valid so that the
test becomes well aligned to rating scales? That is the topic of this article.

In addition to the aforementioned explanations, we think there is another important
reason for the lack of associations between performance- and questionnaire-based
measures of impulsivity. Nearly all performance-based tasks reduce the complex
working of executive function to simple metrics of response time and accuracy—how
fast and accurate one presses a computer key. If impulsivity impacts performance
continuously, much information can be lost. We consider reliance on this
impoverished data acquisition procedure to be a major culprit for the discrepancy
between performance-based and questionnaire-based measures.

This idea is important in light of recent studies pointing to the dynamic nature of
the executive functioning, which is reflected in the variability of response times
in ADHD participants [28] as
well as the dynamic decision conflict resolution that unfolds in two-choice
situations [29]. On a neural
level, this idea is supported by findings in partial activation of motor neurons
during different stages of the decision-making process [30, 31, 32]. Thus, to fully gauge executive functioning
in general and behavioral inhibition in particular, performance-based measures that
tap into continuous and dynamic characteristics of decision making should be
developed.

We think that mouse cursor movement tracking provides a viable remedy. Mouse cursor
movement properties, such as the area under the curve, speed and distance have been
found to be associated with elevated levels of emotion [33], stress [34], cognitive impairment [35], cognitive load [36, 37], as well as ADHD [7, 38, 39]. Mouse and hand movement properties were
also found to be receptive to attention and cognitive control [40, 41] and, most importantly, inhibitory abilities
[42].

In the Stroop task, for example, deviation of a cursor trajectory from the straight
line between the starting point and the endpoint (e.g., response button) was found
to be indicative of congruent or incongruent word color, highlighting the inhibitory
processes [42]. In the delay
discounting paradigm, mouse movement properties have been related to the degree to
which a participant had to overcome an attraction towards an alternative reward
[43].

With these observations in mind, the present study has two aims: (1) we devise a
mouse tracking version of the stop-signal task and examine the extent to which mouse
movement measures improve correlations between SST performance and ADHD
impulsivity/inattention ratings, and (2) we identify specific design features that
improve SST in association with ADHD rating scales. If mouse movement measures
improve SST’s association with ADHD ratings, what trajectory features are most
related to ADHD ratings? Which ADHD subscale (e.g., DSM-IV Inattentive symptoms
versus DSM-IV: Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptoms) is most correlated with SSRT? In a
mouse movement version of SST, how do you define an “incorrect” response in a stop
trial in a mouse movement measure? What would be the best way of devising a stop
signal delay? Is the standard staircase method superior to a pre-fixed method [44]? The present study
addresses these questions.

In two experiments, we contrasted the standard (keypress) and augmented (mouse
movement) versions of the stop-signal test and investigated the extent to which
mouse movement measures improve associations between SST performance and ADHD rating
metrics. In Experiment 1, we applied fixed stop-signal delays [44]. In Experiment 2, we employed a staircase
method to implement a stop-signal delay and compared the efficacy of keypress and
mouse movement versions of the stop-signal task.

Experiment 1: Keypress vs. mouse movement (Preset stop-signal delays)
Methods
All experimental procedures were approved by Texas A&M University
Institutional Review Board (IRB, protocol number: IRB2017-0103D). Written
consent was obtained from all participants.

Participants
A total of 119 Texas A&M undergraduate students who enrolled in an
introductory psychology course participated in the experiment for a course
credit. They were randomly assigned either to a keypress or a mouse movement
condition. Of these participants, 28 did not complete the experiment.
Following the procedure employed by Congdon and colleagues [45], we excluded
participants who failed to reach at least 5% successful response inhibition
in “stop” trials and correctly indicate the coherent dots’ direction in at
least 5% of “go” trials. Table 1 summarizes the participants’ demographic
information.

Procedure. Participants completed the following tasks in
succession:

Stop-signal task

Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS)

Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS for
Adults)

Stop-signal task
Participants were first required to complete the stop-signal task coupled
with a random dot kinematogram [44]. This task consisted of 576 trials,
with 432 trials being “go” trials and 144 trials being “stop” trials.

In the stop-signal task, participants were presented with a circular array of
100 white dots moving in the left or right direction. Each dot was 5 pixels
in size. Either 10, 50 or 80% of these dots were moving coherently. The
remaining dots were moving in random directions. Participants were required
to indicate which direction the coherent dots are moving (“go” trials). We
chose this task as the “go” task because it allows to study the effect of
the “go” stimulus-related information (dot coherency) on behavior in “stop”
trials.

On a subset (25%) of trials, a sound signal appeared prompting participants
to withhold the movement in this trial (“stop” trials). We chose auditory
stop-signal because delivering the stop-signal in this modality has been
found to increase the speed and accuracy of stopping processes [46].

Each trial started with a fixation cross that remained on screen for 500 ms.
After this, the random dot stimulus appeared for 1100 ms. With the onset of
the stimulus, participants had an opportunity to make a response within 3100
ms. In the stop trials, a sound indicating “stop” signal appeared for 100 ms
after a delay from the onset of stimulus presentation.

Stop-signal delay values were randomly and uniformly chosen from 100, 200,
300, 400, 500 or 600 ms. The trial ended either when participants made a
response or 3100 ms since the onset of stimulus have passed. After each
trial, participants were given feedback on their performance. Following the
procedure employed in the Ma and Yu study [44], participants were given 100 points
for a correct response (a correct indication of movement direction or, in
stop trials, correct inhibition) and subtracted 50 points for each incorrect
response to encourage the best performance. Stimuli and feedback were
displayed in white font on a grey background. Fig 1 shows typical trials in both
conditions.

10.1371/journal.pone.0225437.g001Fig 1 Hypothetical trials in keypress and mouse movement
conditions.
A: Hypothetical trial in the keypress condition. In this
trial, a stop-signal (beep) is presented after a 600 ms delay. The
participant does not make a response in this example.
B: Hypothetical trial in the mouse movement
condition. In this example, the participant incorrectly identifies
the direction of the dot movement as “right”. With the onset of
stimulus in each trial in the mouse movement condition, the mouse
cursor was placed in the center of the bottom of the screen (0,
-0.8), where (0,0) represents the center of the screen in the x-y
coordinate system.

The keypress and mouse movement conditions were identical, with an exception
for their response collection procedures. In the keypress condition,
participants indicated the direction of the dots by pressing a left or right
arrow key on the keyboard; in the mouse movement condition participants
indicated the direction of the dots by clicking on the button with a left or
right arrow drawn. Our program recorded x-y coordinates of the mouse cursor
every 16 ms. We used Psychopy [47] software for stimulus presentation
and data acquisition.

Design
We employed a between-subjects design with one factor (keypress or mouse
movement condition). The choice of this design was based on the assumption
that a within-subjects design would have increased the number of trials per
participant to more than a thousand, potentially inducing fatigue and
instructional confusion.

Proactive and reactive inhibition measures
There are at least two types of inhibitory control—reactive inhibition and
proactive inhibition. Reactive inhibition represents an individual’s ability
to inhibit an already initiated motor response, while proactive inhibition
is a change in motor strategies “in anticipation of known task demands” (p.
1126) [18]. Proactive
inhibition is related to the attenuation of a motor plan relevant to the
task [48]. In this
study, we assessed both proactive and reactive inhibition, as they are
important for ADHD [49].

Research has demonstrated that proactive inhibition can be assessed by the
“reaching arm” version of the stop-signal task [50]. Following [21, 44], we measured proactive inhibition
with movement initiation time and movement time (the details of these
measures are explained later in this section).

To assess reactive inhibition, we measured stop-signal reaction time (SSRT)
using the integration method [21]. SSRT is calculated by subtracting
SSD (stop signal delay) from the finishing time of the stop process, which
is found by integrating the RT distribution and finding the point at which
the integral equals the probability of response when a stop-signal is
present [50].
Specifically, “go” RTs are rank-ordered and then the n-th “go” RT is
selected, with n corresponding to the proportion of inhibitory failures. For
example, if the proportion of inhibitory failures (the proportion of making
a response in stop trials) is 0.55 for a given participant, n-th “go” RT
(finishing time) is the RT equal to the 55th percentile of the “go” RTs. If
preset SSDs are used, finishing time is estimated for each SSD and their
respective SSDs are then subtracted; to obtain a single SSRT estimate for a
given participant, SSRT estimates for different stop-signal delays are
averaged [51].

The calculation of SSRT entails defining inhibitory failures (making a
response in a “stop” trial). In Experiment 1, we defined “erroneous
response” as pressing a key in a stop trial in the keypress condition. In
the mouse movement condition, we defined “erroneous response” as
participants clicking on a button drawn on the screen in a stop trial.

Keypress condition
In the keypress condition, the main independent variables were accuracy, mean
and standard deviation of response time and SSRT. Accuracy was calculated
for “go” and “stop” trials separately, as well as with respect to
participants’ indication of direction (direction discrimination accuracy).
Mean and standard deviation of response time were calculated in “go” and
“stop” trials separately. In addition, the mean and standard deviation of
response times (SD RT) were calculated with respect to three levels of dot
coherency (10, 50, or 80% of dots moving in the same direction).

Mouse movement condition
In this study, we have aimed to assess stopping impulsivity–a specific form
of impulsivity defined [52] as “the tendency to stop an already chosen and initiated,
but not fully executed, response” (p.159). Traditionally, this form of
impulsivity is assessed through SSRT. However, SSRT is an indirect measure:
for example, Verbruggen and Logan [53] consider SSRT an estimate of a
covert latency of the stopping process. The continuous design allows for a
more direct study of the stopping processes: as Logan and Cowan [54] suggest,
“Continuous tasks … offer a way of estimating stop-signal reaction time that
does not depend on inhibition functions: The chain of responses stops
sometime after the stop signal, and the time between the onset of
the stop signal and the occurrence of the last response to be emitted
can be used as an estimate of stop-signal reaction time” (p.
319, underscore supplied).

Furthermore, although the horse-race model formalizes the competition between
“stop” and “go” processes as a race for a certain threshold, the process of
response inhibition is unlikely to be discrete. Shenoy and Yu [55] posit inhibitory
control as a dynamic decision-making process, in which an individual
“repeatedly assesses the relative value of stopping and going on a fine
temporal scale, in order to make an optimal decision on when and whether to
go” (p. 1).

Given our aim of studying stopping impulsivity (i.e., stopping an already
initiated, but not fully executed, response [45]), findings in dynamic nature of
response inhibition and the potential advantages of continuous measurement,
we have employed the design different from the one found in the “reaching
arm” paradigm [56].
In our version of the stop-signal paradigm, movement can be initiated before
the stop-signal is delivered, allowing one to calculate measures that are
based on the trajectory of the mouse movement, including mouse
movement-based continuous analog of SSRT (i.e., stopping distance, explained
later in more detail).

In the mouse movement condition (in addition to the RT and accuracy-based
measures) we calculated mean maximum velocity, mean maximum acceleration and
mean total distance, separately in go and stop trials and with respect to
three levels of dot coherency. Each trajectory was calculated as a sum of
distances between adjacent sets of coordinates according to the time of
their recording. If 3100 ms passed and the trial ended with no response, all
trajectories recorded during the trial were added. No movement was treated
as a movement with the distance between coordinates at different timestamps
equal to zero. All trajectories were time-normalized using 101 timesteps
[57]. For
analyzing the cursor trajectory data, we used “mousetrap” package for the R
statistical environment [58].

We employed maximum velocity and maximum acceleration (Fig 2) because these measures are likely
to reflect levels of commitment, vigor and even impulsiveness for action
[59, 60, 61, 7, 62]. Moreover, as the
conflict between two options is reflected in the mouse movement [29], mouse movement
measures represent the process of resolution of the conflict between “stop”
and “go” options.

10.1371/journal.pone.0225437.g002Fig 2 Calculation of trajectory-based measures.
Note: t represents the time between recordings (≈ 19
ms). Maximum velocity was calculated as the maximum speed with which
the movement between two adjacent sets of coordinates took place.
Maximum acceleration stands for maximum change in the velocity of
the mouse movement between the two adjacent parts of the trajectory.
Mean total distance represents the mean of total Euclidean distance
from the original starting position of the cursor to the position of
the cursor at the end of the trial.

As a mouse movement measure analog to SSRT, we devised stopping distance
(Δ). This measure represents the distance that the
cursor travels after stop-signal is heard, similar to the time that an
individual needs to put the foot on the brake after he or she sees the red
traffic light. However, in contrast to SSRT, which is implicit, stopping
distance can be directly estimated from a total distance in a trial:
 Δ=dtotal−dbeforestopsignal,  where dtotal is
total distance an individual has traveled in a given trial,
dbefore stop-signal is the distance traveled
before stop-signal has appeared and Δ is stopping distance
(Fig 3).

10.1371/journal.pone.0225437.g003Fig 3 Calculation of stopping distance.
Note: in this hypothetical trial, an individual
continued to move the mouse for some time after hearing the “stop”
signal. Stopping distance (Δ) is represented by the
dashed line. Distance before stop-signal (dbefore) is
represented by a solid line.

This measure was calculated separately for each preset stop-signal delay and
averaged across all trials for each participant. After that, stopping
distances for each stop-signal delay were averaged:  Δaverage=Δ1+Δ2+⋯+Δnn,  where
Δ1,Δ2…Δn
are stopping distances calculated for 1st, 2nd, and
nth stop-signal delay, respectively.

When inhibition is not applied, greater acceleration and velocity are
achieved [63]. In
addition to that, lower maximum velocity and acceleration were linked to
responses requiring more top-down control, e.g. ones that required the
deception [64].
Stopping distance cannot be attributed to the muscular constraints but is
rather a result of higher-level planning [65].

For studying proactive inhibition, we employed, following Mirabella and
colleagues [21],
movement initiation time and movement time. Movement initiation time was
calculated relative to the onset of the random dot kinematogram. Movement
time was calculated as the difference between movement initiation time and
time when a participant clicked the response button or the trial ended and
the recording stopped. These measures were calculated only for the “go”
trials since proactive inhibition can manifest as slowing the response in
anticipation of the “stop” signal [66].

Results. To make sure samples collected in keypress and mouse movement
conditions are comparable in their ADHD and impulsivity/inattention levels,
we first analyzed the differences in distributions of scores on different
questionnaire scales between two samples. We also investigated the
correlations between impulsivity/inattention scores and performance in the
stop-signal task, separately in keypress and mouse movement conditions.
Finally, we applied ridge regression to assess the predictive ability of the
keypress and mouse movement measures and find the features that are most
strongly related to inclination towards different subsets of ADHD.

Distributions of CAARS & BDEFS scores in keypress and mouse movement
conditions
Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed no difference in distributions of
questionnaire scores between keypress and mouse movement conditions on any
subscale.

Correlation analysis
To investigate the correlations between performance-based measures and
impulsivity/inattention profile, we used Spearman’s rank correlation.
Following the Ma and Yu study [44], we also examined the extent to
which different non-inhibition-related factors affect the associations
between performance measures and questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity
and inattention. Specifically, we examined the changes in associations
between SSRT and other measures and scores on different subscales across
different levels of dot coherency.

Correlations between performance and impulsivity measures in keypress
condition
In the keypress condition, we have found a few correlations between RT- or
accuracy-based measures and scores on the questionnaires. Specifically,
significant correlations were observed between mean RT in “stop” trials and
scores indicating an inclination towards Inattentive subtype of ADHD
(ρ = -0.27, p = .04), as well as
between accuracy in “stop” trials and Impulsivity/Emotional lability
subscale (ρ = -0.29, p = .03).
Correlations with impulsivity and inattention measures are summarized in
Table 2.

Correlations between performance and impulsivity measures in the mouse
movement condition
In contrast to the keypress condition, we have found multiple correlations
between mouse movement measures and impulsivity/inattention scores.

Simple RT- and accuracy-based measures collected in mouse movement condition
had no significant correlations with impulsivity measures, but had a few
significant correlations with inattention measures, summarized in Table 4:

Among mouse movement-specific measures, significant correlations were
observed between BDEFS Section 5—Self-regulation of emotion and accuracy in
“stop” trials (ρ = -0.38, p = .025) and
BDEFS Section 5 and SSRT (ρ = 0.35, p =
.04) Among mouse-specific measures, the strongest associations were found
between scores on subscale C–Impulsivity/Emotional lability–and average
stopping distance (ρ = 0.43, p = .01).
Scores on this subscale were also significantly correlated with mean total
distance in “go” (ρ = 0.34, p = .044) and “stop”
(ρ = 0.38, p = .024) trials, as well as mean maximum
acceleration in “stop” trials (ρ = 0.36, p
= .034). Inclination towards a primarily impulsive subtype of ADHD (subscale
F) was significantly correlated with mean maximum velocity in “go”
(ρ = -0.45, p = .006) and “stop”
(ρ = -0.44, p = .009) trials. Table 5 summarizes the
correlations between mouse movement measures and impulsivity measures.

After separating trials by different dot coherency levels (10%, 50%, and
80%), significant correlations appeared between scores subscale C and total
distance in “go” and “stop” trials at 10% and 50% levels of dot coherency.
Impulsivity/Emotional lability was also significantly correlated with mean
maximum acceleration in stop trials at 50% (ρ = 0.47,
p = .004). In contrast with keypress condition, a
measure analogous to SSRT–average stopping distance–was significantly
correlated with Impulsivity/Emotional lability scores at all levels of
coherency.

Inclination towards Impulsive subtype (subscale F) showed significant
correlations with mean maximum velocity in “go” and “stop” trials at all
levels of coherency. Tables 6–8

Feature selection and prediction performance
So far, our analysis focused on correlations between performance measures
(e.g., maximum velocity in stop trials) and ADHD ratings
(hyperactive/impulsive symptoms). These correlation measures show the degree
of association between two sets of data. It is unclear how well one can
predict hypothetical questionnaire scores based on the performance measures
(collected in keypress or mouse movement conditions). It is also unclear
which performance features are related to different ADHD subtypes. Mouse
movement features, such as maximum velocity and maximum acceleration, are by
design correlated. This intercorrelation poses a risk of multicollinearity.
To investigate these questions, we applied ridge regression and conducted
feature subset selection and model assessment following the procedure
delineated by James and colleagues [68].

Feature subset selection
For the feature subset selection, we applied ridge regression. Ridge
regression is a regression technique especially useful when data suffer from
multicollinearity [69]. Multicollinearity occurs when some predictors are strongly
correlated with others. When it happens, the variance of coefficient
estimates can dramatically increase.

Ridge regression reduces the coefficient estimates using a regularization
parameter, λ. To choose the best λ, we
employed 10-fold cross-validation [68]. Each data set was divided into 10
segments (folds 1–10). One segment was left for the test (fold 1), and the
remaining segments (folds 2–10) were used for training. In the training
segments (folds 2–10), models with various lambda values are assessed and
tested with the test data (fold 1). This process was repeated 10 times with
other folds, and the lambda that yielded the minimum mean squared error with
the test data was selected. In both keypress and mouse movement conditions,
we standardized the predictors (mean = 0, SD = 1).

In the keypress condition, the most important features for subscale F
(DSM-IV: Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms) were accuracy in “go” trials and
SSRT. Accuracy in “go” trials and direction discrimination accuracy were
also indicative of subscale E (DSM-IV: Inattentive symptoms) (Fig 4). In the mouse
movement condition, the most important features for subscale F (DSM-IV:
Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms) were mean maximum velocity in “go” trials
and stopping distance. For subscale E (DSM-IV: Inattentive symptoms), the
most important features were acceleration in “go” trials and SSRT.

10.1371/journal.pone.0225437.g004Fig 4 Ridge regression coefficients in keypress and mouse movement
conditions.
Note: coefficient value closer to zero indicates
less importance. DDA = Direction discrimination accuracy.

A comparison of coefficients’ absolute values between keypress and mouse
movement conditions reveals that for Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms
subscale, features in mouse movement condition had larger absolute values.
In contrast, features in keypress condition had greater coefficients’ value
for Inattentive symptoms subscale.

Evaluation of prediction performance
What is the prediction capacity of these features? That is, given “new”
subjects, to what extent can these measures predict ADHD ratings of the
“unknown” subjects? In order to evaluate the prediction performance of
models in keypress and mouse movement, we applied the nested
cross-validation (CV) method—10-fold cross-validation nested within 5-fold
cross-validation (5-fold CV), combined with bootstrapping sampling. In the
outer layer of cross-validation (5-fold CV), fold 1 was left for the test,
while folds 2–5 were used for model selection. Within the training data
(folds 2–5), we applied the 10-fold CV to find the best lambda as described
in the feature selection section. The model (λ and coefficients) thus
identified in the 10-fold CV the training data (folds 2–5 in the 5-fold CV)
were assessed by the test data (fold 1 in the 5-fold CV). This process was
cycled over other folds (e.g., fold 2 for test and folds 1, 3, 4, 5 for
training, and so on) and repeated 1000 times with bootstrapped samples (in
each iteration of 5-fold CV, samples were selected randomly from original
data with replacement). In this manner, we separated the model selection and
model assessment completely and examined the extent to which identified
models can infer ADHD ratings of “new” pseudo-participants.

As Table 9 shows, the
models formed in the mouse movement condition performed well for the
subscales C (Impulsivity/Emotional lability) and F (DSM-IV:
Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms). Given subscale E (DSM-IV: Inattentive
symptoms), the model formed in the keypress condition showed good prediction
performance.

Discussion
In Experiment 1, we found that measures collected in mouse movement-based
stop-signal task had more significant correlations with questionnaire
measures of impulsivity and inattention than those collected in the
traditional keypress-based stop-signal task.

In the keypress condition, no significant correlations were observed with
scores on subscales C (Impulsivity/Emotional lability) or F (DSM-IV:
Impulsive subtype). In addition to that, as the results of ridge regression
analysis show, keypress measures better predicted (by the measure of the
correlation between predicted and test data) scores on subscales A
(Inattention/Memory problems) and E (DSM-IV: Inattentive symptoms).
Moreover, as feature selection shows, coefficients with the largest absolute
value were produced for Inattentive symptoms subscale.

In contrast, mouse movement measures, particularly mean maximum velocity and
stopping distance, were correlated with CAARS scores on the inclination
towards a primarily Impulsive subtype. For Inattentive symptoms, as well as
for inclination towards the Inattentive subtype of ADHD, no mouse movement
measures had any significant correlation with questionnaire scores.
Furthermore, in contrast with the models in the keypress condition, models
in mouse movement condition were good at predicting scores on
impulsivity-related subscales: C (Impulsivity/Emotional lability) and F
(DSM-IV: Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms). Coefficients with the absolute
value farthest away from zero for models in mouse movement condition were
produced for Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms subscale.

In the traditional horse-race inhibition model [53], “go” and “stop” processes are
assumed to be independent (i.e., processes affecting “go” processes do not
affect “stop” processes) (but see Ma & Yu [44], Logan et al. [70] and Schall,
Palmieri and Logan [71]). Thus, dot coherency was supposed to be relevant only for
“go” trials to correctly indicate the direction of the coherent dot
movement. However, in this experiment, dot coherency in “stop” trials
influenced correlations with CAARS scores. We found that in both the
keypress and mouse movement conditions, correlations between performance in
“stop” trials and questionnaire-based measures depended on dot coherency.
For example, velocity and acceleration in “stop” trials had significant
correlations with questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity on the 50% dot
coherency level, but not 10 or 80%.

Given that, the influence of dot coherence on behavior in “stop” trials is
vexing. At this point, we do not have a clear explanation for why dot
coherency impacted the association between stop-signal task performance and
ADHD questionnaire scores. It is possible that, in order for the stop-signal
task to be effective, the secondary task (i.e., judging the left-right
direction of random dots) needs to be reasonably engaging. Thus, judgment
processes for go trials and stop trials are mutually dependent.

Following the finding that control processes involving go and stop judgment
are continuous and inseparable [44], Experiment 1 employed the
integration method to calculate SSRT. The advantage of the mouse movement
measures as an impulsivity-related assessment tool may be limited to this
special circumstance. Although previous studies reported no difference
between SSRTs calculated with fixed-SSD and staircase methods of setting
SSDs [72], the
difference can be attributed to the different response strategies employed
by participants. Specifically, in the staircase method condition,
participants might tend to choose to wait for the stop-signal more,
allocating more resources to the motor inhibition [73]. If an individual chooses this
strategy, it is likely that both response time and mouse movement measures
would be affected as well.

In Experiment 2, we employed the staircase method of calculating stop-signal
delays and contrasted the keypress and mouse movement measures in
impulsivity assessment.

Experiment 2: Keypress vs. mouse movement (stop-signal delays set using the
staircase method)
The design and procedure of Experiment 2 were identical to those described in
Experiment 1, except that we employed a staircase method to implement stop-signal
delays and a different way of defining inhibition failure.

Methods
Participants
A total of 113 Texas A&M undergraduate students who enrolled in an
introductory psychology course participated in the experiment for course
credit. They were randomly assigned either to a keypress or mouse movement
condition. Of these participants, 13 did not complete the experiment. As in
Experiment 1, we excluded participants who failed to reach at least 5%
successful response inhibition in “stop” trials and correctly indicate the
coherent dots’ direction in at least 5% of “go” trials. Table 10 summarizes the
participants’ demographic information.

motion	N	15	35	50	
	Age	19.1 (1.93)	18.8 (1.11)	18.96 (1.6)	
Values outside and inside parentheses indicate the mean and
standard deviations of participants’ age, respectively.

Design
The design of Experiment 2 was identical to that of Experiment 1 with a few
exceptions: In Experiment 2, we employed a staircase method to calculate a
stop-signal delay. When a participant made a successful inhibition (e.g., a
participant not responding in a “stop” trial), stop-signal delay (SSD) was
increased by 50 ms. Conversely, when the participant failed to inhibit the
response in a “stop” trial, SSD was decreased by 50 ms [74]. In the mouse
movement condition, a failure of inhibition (i.e., making a response in a
stop trial) was defined as the participant moving the cursor beyond a
cut-off line of a 25% of the vertical distance connecting the centers of the
start button and an end button (Fig 5). The initial SSD was set at 600 ms for all participants,
which corresponds to “stop” accuracy of 50% in Experiment 1. To calculate
SSRT, we calculated overall finishing time by rank-ordering RTs in “go”
trials and selecting RT equal to nth percentile, where n is equal to the
proportion of inhibitory failures. We then averaged SSDs over all
stop-signal trials and subtracted the mean SSD from the finishing time to
provide a subject-level SSRT estimate [51].

Red dashed line drawn at 25% of the vertical distance connecting the
start position and an end button depicts the cutoff for the response
in a “stop” trial.

Because BDEFS questionnaires were not correlated with any of the response
time, accuracy, and mouse movement measures, BDEFS measures were not
included in Experiment 2.

Results
We first investigated the differences in distributions of scores on different
questionnaire scales between the two samples. Then, we analyzed correlations
and predictive abilities of regression models describing the relationship
between impulsivity/inattention scores and performance measures and
identified the most important features. These analyses were performed
separately in keypress and mouse movement conditions.

Distributions of CAARS scores in keypress and mouse movement
conditions
Save for subscales C (Impulsivity/Emotional lability) (d =
0.28, p = .04) and E (DSM-IV: Inattentive symptoms)
(d = 0.28, p = .04), no significant
differences in scores between two conditions were observed.

Correlation analysis
Similar to the previous experiment, we employed Spearman’s rank correlation
due to its robustness to outliers. We also included different dot coherency
levels in our analysis.

Correlations between performance and impulsivity measures in keypress
condition
In the keypress condition, most significant correlations with questionnaire
scores were found only with accuracy in “go” trials (Table 11).

Correlations between performance and impulsivity measures in
mouse movement condition. In contrast, we found a
number of significant correlations in the mouse movement condition. Among
simple RT- and accuracy-based measures, correlations appeared mostly with
inattention measures. These correlations are summarized in Table 13.

Among mouse movement-specific measures, such as velocity, acceleration, and
total distance, most correlations appeared with inattention measures, albeit
a few strong ones were also found with impulsivity measures (Table 15).

Feature subset selection and prediction performance
As in Experiment 1, we applied ridge regression to assess the predictive
capacity of keypress and mouse movement measures and indicate the specific
features related to the different ADHD subtypes.

Feature subset selection
As in the first experiment, we used 10-fold cross-validation approach in both
keypress and mouse movement conditions. In the keypress condition, for
subscale F (DSM-IV: Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms), the most important
predictors were SD RT in “stop” trials and accuracy in “go” trials. For
subscale E (DSM-IV: Inattentive symptoms) most important predictors were
accuracy in “go” trials and “stop” trials and mean RT in “stop” trials.

In the mouse movement condition, for subscale F (DSM-IV:
Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms), the most important predictors were mean
maximum velocity in “go” and “stop” trials. For subscale E (DSM-IV:
Inattentive symptoms) most important predictors were acceleration in “stop”
trials and mean RT in “go” trials.

A comparison of coefficients’ absolute values between keypress and mouse
movement conditions reveals that for both Hyperactive/Impulsive and
Inattentive symptoms subscales, features in mouse movement condition had
larger absolute values (Fig
6).

Evaluation of prediction performance
As in the first experiment, we used 5- and 10-fold nested cross-validation
together with bootstrapping. We produced 1000 values of Spearman’s
coefficient of correlation between predicted and testing data. Mouse
movement-based models were good at predicting the scores on subscales F
(DSM-IV: Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms), A (Inattention/Memory problems)
and E (DSM-IV: Inattentive symptoms), while models in keypress conditions
were good for predicting scores on the Impulsivity/Emotional lability
subscale (Table
19).

Discussion
As in Experiment 1, we found very few correlations between RT/accuracy-based
measures and impulsivity/inattention subscales. In the keypress condition,
we found no significant correlations between performance-based measures and
questionnaire subscales describing inclination towards primarily Impulsive
or Inattentive subtypes of ADHD. Only the correlation between accuracy in
“go” trials and Impulsivity/Emotional lability scores remained significant
after false discovery rate control. No SSRT measure had any significant
associations with any questionnaire measures in the keypress condition.

In contrast, in the mouse movement condition, strong correlations were found
between inclinations towards Impulsive and Inattentive subtypes of ADHD on
the one hand and maximum velocity and acceleration in stop trials on the
other. These correlations remained significant after controlling for the
false discovery rate. Furthermore, ridge regression analysis showed that
models using mouse movement measures performed better at predicting scores
on the inclination towards different subtypes of ADHD better than models
using only RT- and accuracy-based measures. In addition to that, feature
selection analysis shows that the absolute values of coefficients in models
in mouse movement condition are greater than those in the models for the
keypress condition.

These findings suggest that mouse movement measures can supplement SSRT in
behavioral impulsivity measures. Interestingly, in the mouse movement
condition measures remained significant at a certain level of coherency
(50%). This discrepancy, given that the measure in question was calculated
based on data from “stop” trials, implies some connection between “stop” and
“go” processes. In other words, information pertaining to “go” processes is
likely to influence “stop” processes.

Because SSRT is calculated using stop-signal delay (SSD), it is important to
identify which cut-off line (i.e., response inhibition criteria) produces
the most effective SSRT measures. Unlike the preset method (used in
Experiment 1), the staircase method dynamically adjusts stop-signal delay
(SSD) as participants make a “correct” or “incorrect” response in a “stop”
trial. In Experiment 2, we employed a cut-off line of a 25% of the vertical
distance connecting the start position and an end button (Fig 5) to flag an
“incorrect” response in a “stop” trial. In this case, the criterion for
response inhibition was high in the sense that the cursor moving beyond the
25% cut-off line was treated as a failure of response inhibition.

General discussion
We compared traditional (keypress) and augmented (mouse movement) versions of the
stop-signal task in their associations with questionnaire-based
impulsivity/inattention measures. Impulsivity and inattention were assessed through
specific scales of Conners’ Adult ADHD Questionnaire.

In Experiment 1, the stop-signal delay was randomly chosen from preset values. We
found that keypress measures, including SSRT, had a small association with
questionnaire measures, while mouse movement measures had strong and significant
correlations. Moreover, mouse movement measures predicted scores on impulsivity
subscales better than those in keypress condition. For inclination towards
Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype of ADHD, mouse movement measures produced coefficients
with greater absolute values than keypress measures, indicating their greater
importance for predicting the scores.

In Experiment 2, we employed a staircase method of setting a stop-signal delay, with
a more challenging response inhibition criterion (a failure of response inhibition
was defined as the cursor crossing 25% of the vertical line between the starting
position and the center of response buttons). Mouse movement measures produced
strong and significant correlations with scores on the inclination towards
Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype of ADHD. SSRT measured in the keypress condition had
little to no association with impulsivity measures. Mouse movement measures
predicted scores for almost all subscales well, save for Impulsivity/Emotional
lability. Similar to Experiment 1, for mouse movement measures, the coefficients’
values were greater.

Taken together, these results suggest that mouse movement measures enhance a
stop-signal task in impulsivity and inattention assessment. One of the most popular
measures collected in stop-signal tasks, SSRT, was found to have small associations
with impulsivity or inattentiveness. Mouse movement measures had, in contrast,
strong and significant associations with impulsivity. However, this association was
contingent on specific SST design features: it was strong when the inhibition
criterion was more challenging (Experiment 2).

The association was particularly strong when the stop-signal delay was devised with
the fixed-SSD method (Ma & Yu, 2016). In the context of our experiment, the
fixed-SSD method has been shown to be superior to the staircase method when it comes
to the assessment of impulsivity (Experiment 1); for inattention, staircase method
was better (Experiment 2).

Theoretical implications
In Experiment 1, we found almost no correlations between mouse movement measures
and inattention measures, while in Experiment 2, we found strong correlations
between mouse movement measures and inclination towards a primarily Inattentive
subtype of ADHD. We speculate that this is related to the specific strategies
that a staircase method of setting stop-signal delay prompts a participant to
adopt.

As suggested above, the staircase method of SSD setting might be prompting an
individual to engage more in suppressing the initiation of responses (proactive
inhibitory control) due to its greater reliance on an individual’s performance.
Attentional monitoring was found to be a very important part of proactive
inhibitory control [75].
Because of that, performance in tasks using the staircase method of setting
stop-signal delay might be more representative of inattention, as evidenced by
the correlations with inattention measures that appeared in Experiment 2.

If the staircase procedure does indeed prompt an individual to engage in
additional proactive response inhibition, the discrepancy between correlations
in Experiment 1 (fixed-SSD method) and Experiment 2 can be explained from Toplak
and colleagues’ standpoint [24]. According to them, the reason for the discrepancy in
correlations between measures collected traditional performance-based tasks and
questionnaire-based measurers is that performance-based tasks assess optimal
behavior, while questionnaire-based measures assess typical behavior, and are
thus more indicative of an individual’s real-world functioning. The staircase
procedure, in our case, is more prompting of optimal performance. The fixed-SSD
method, on the other hand, is less demanding, allowing an individual to display
his typical performance. Because of that, SST using fixed-SSD procedure might be
more applicable to gauge individual differences in ADHD-related impulsivity.

Practical implications
Our findings point to an important potential application of mouse movement
measures as a way to indicate different subtypes of ADHD. In Experiment 1, when
preset SSDs were used, we found strong and significant correlations between
mouse movement measures and inclination towards Impulsive subtype of ADHD
(subscale F). Regression models including mouse movement measures have shown
significant associations with scores on this subscale as well. On the other
hand, keypress measures had significant associations with the inclination
towards Inattentive subtype of ADHD (subscale E), indicated by both correlation
measures and predictive regression models.

In other words, associations between performance measures and inclination towards
different subtypes of ADHD were dependent on which type of performance measures
was used (RT/accuracy-based or mouse-movement-specific). Evaluating an
individual’s performance with respect to both types of measures can be helpful
to indicate his or her inclination towards Impulsive or Inattentive subtype of
ADHD.

Another practical advantage of mouse movement tracking as a tool to gauge
individual differences in response inhibition lies in a distinct target
population. As Lijfijjt and colleagues point out [76], among adults, ADHD is more associated
with motor control of inhibition. Even though SSRT is a measure of motor control
as well, two important limitations persist: first, SSRT is estimated from
response time and accuracy; second, it is an indirect measure. Mouse movement
measures do not have these constraints.

Among features of decision making, motor control is of particular interest for
ADHD diagnosis, since impairments in it are well known to accompany ADHD [77]. Two areas of executive
functions—control of attention and urges, impairment in which is most commonly
associated with ADHD, were found to account for almost a half of variance in
fine motor skills, and more than a half in gross motor skills among children
[78].

These impairments of motor skills include [79], among both children and adults, a
heightened muscle tone and lessened ability to inhibit the movement, including
legs, hands (i.e. gross motor skills) and thumbs (fine motor skills). In
addition to these findings, children with ADHD were found to have more
coordination problems, than healthy controls [80]. These problems include manual
dexterity as well as aiming and catching (assessed with ball task). Among
subtypes of ADHD, motor problems were found to be associated with Inattentive
and Combined subtypes (but not Impulsive). Consistent with these findings, our
current results highlight the significance of studying motor behavior in adult
ADHD.

Potential and limits of mouse movement augmentation
Because ADHD is a clinical disorder, we recognize the limitation associated with
our choice of participants’ demographic. This choice, however, can be justified.
Past studies [81] point
to the excessive rigidity of the ADHD criteria outlined in diagnostic manuals.
This rigidity might potentially exclude individuals with late-onset or
subclinical (failing to meet the full clinical definition) ADHD, even though
they still experience ADHD-like symptoms and are susceptible to disorders such
as cocaine or alcohol abuse [82, 83]. In
other words, individuals who are not formally diagnosed with ADHD might still
experience ADHD-like symptoms, prompting the need for proper diagnostic tools.
Nevertheless, as a future venue for research, we propose contrasting performance
in our augmented stop-signal task between ADHD-diagnosed individuals and healthy
controls.

In the future, we are also considering studying the associations between
performance in the augmented stop-signal task and questionnaire scores for other
clinical populations beside ADHD. These populations include but are not limited
to, individuals with OCD and substance abuse due to the importance that impulse
and urge control play in these disorders [84, 85].

In addition to that, since measures used in this article (velocity, acceleration,
and distance) are based on temporal and spatial information about the position
of the mouse cursor, the usability of mouse movement measures is inextricable
from the quality of timestamp and x-y coordinate registration. For example, if a
mouse has a poor sensor, some of the changes in its position can be omitted.
Similar concerns can be directed to the surface on which the mouse is placed.
Inaccurate reflection of the mouse position and its changes over time can
contaminate the mouse movement data and provide an inaccurate picture of an
individual’s ability to inhibit his or her responses. These limitations should
be considered before using mouse movement in an experimental setting.

Further extensions
As for any method, mouse movement version of the stop-signal task can be improved
in different aspects. One of these aspects is the inclusion of
trajectory-related measures of mouse movement. As Maldonado and colleagues have
shown [86],
trajectory-related measures are more informative of the decision-making process
than speed, acceleration, and other similar measures. Future studies can greatly
benefit from the inclusion of trajectory-based measures. In our opinion, these
measures can help contrast the differences in the decision-making process
between healthy and ADHD-prone individuals (or between individuals with
different subtypes of ADHD).

Conclusion
We have found that RT/accuracy-based and mouse movement measures tend to be
associated with impulsivity and inattentiveness, respectively. Our findings also
point to the influence of stop-signal delay setting method on associations with
impulsivity and inattention.

Our findings highlight the need for expanding the stop-signal task measures of
ADHD-related impulsive traits in under-researched populations, such as college
students, to include mouse movement measures as a part of SST’s measures.

We also consider research into the differences between behaviors in stop-signal
tasks using preset SSDs and staircase method of SSD to be very important. The
discrepancy in associations between mouse movement measures and impulsivity
measures in Experiments 1 (which uses preset SSDs) and 2 (which uses staircase
method) point to the importance of SSD setting method for associations between
behavioral and questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity. While we provide a
potential explanation of this discrepancy above, further investigation is
needed.

It should be noted, however, that traditional stop-signal task’s measure–SSRT and
other response time/accuracy-based measures—remain useful in regards to
inhibition. In the diagnostic process, mouse movement measures should be used
together with–not instead of–stop-signal reaction time.

In conclusion, this study has yielded important findings in the potential of
mouse movement measures for detection of individual differences across the ADHD
spectrum. It has also highlighted new venues for research into the influence of
SST’s parameters, such as method of stop-signal delay setting or different
response inhibition criteria, on an individual’s stopping behavior and
associations between performance and questionnaire-based measures. We suggest
that future research on ADHD and inhibition will benefit from incorporating
mouse movement measures.
