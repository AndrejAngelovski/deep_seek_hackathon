2 Experimental design, materials, and methods
The associated review and meta-analysis [1] was designed to establish whether there is any difference in baseline glutamate or GABA levels in individuals at high risk of developing psychosis (clinical or genetic high-risk states) compared to healthy controls as measured with 1H-MRS (levels of cerebral glutamate (glutamate, glutamine, or Glx) and/or GABA measured by applying a voxel of interest in a cerebral region) where HR and healthy controls are being compared.

High-risk states included clinical high risk as measured by clinical assessment tools (e.g., CAARMS, SIPS, or SOPS) as well as genetic high risk (having a relative with a psychotic disorder).

Embase and MEDLINE databases were searched for all relevant case/control studies without restrictions on language, year, or publication status. Studies fulfilling the search strategy were included search terms: (Ultra high risk or Genetic high risk or Clinical high risk or High risk) and (Glutamate* or GABA* or Neurotransmitter*) and (MRS or Spectroscopy or MR* or Magnetic resonance spectroscopy or 1H-MRS). If more than one scan was done in the same population, we only included the baseline values.

Reference lists of included studies and reviews were searched manually for additional studies, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for ongoing or unpublished studies, and the responsible researchers were contacted and asked to share potential unpublished data. We received no unpublished data.

We excluded studies with no comparison group or with the wrong comparison group (e.g., not healthy controls such as patients with schizophrenia or first-episode psychosis) as well as studies with previously published results.

The first search was performed on March 10th, 2019, and the final search was performed on April 9th, 2019, where no new eligible studies were found.

Two researchers performed the literature search (CW and FZ). Titles and abstracts screening, as well as full-text screening, were done independently by the two above mentioned researches. Any disagreements between the two independent assessors were resolved through discussion, with CW having the final word. Data from each study were independently extracted from the included studies by CW and FZ. CW compared the extracted data and determined the consensus. We used covidence.org for importing studies, title and abstracts screening, full-text screening, and for extracting and storing the data. Primary data extracted were available metabolite levels of GABA, Glx, glutamate, or glutamine measured by 1H-MRS. Risk of bias assessment of included studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Data were subsequently exported to The Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software package (RevMan Version 5.3) were meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects, inverse-weighted variance model to calculate the pooled effect size since studies were expected to display high heterogeneity based on different correction methods, varying regions of interest, and diverse high-risk groups. The study effect size was weighted according to sample size. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 value, with higher percentages signifying higher variation across studies in the meta-analysis. Significance was assessed using two-sided 95% confidence intervals.

Meta-analyses were performed separately for mean values of GABA, glutamate, and Glx (only two studies reported glutamine levels; hence, no meta-analysis was performed for this metabolite). If means or standard deviations were not published or only reported in figures, authors were contacted for this information. If we did not receive a response, means and SDs were estimated from represented figures using WebPlotDigitizer or—if not shown in figures—not included in the meta-analysis (Table 1 provides more detail on this). Potential publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots for studies on glutamate, Glx, and GABA, respectively (Fig. 3).

Each metabolite results was sorted into relevant subdomains of the brain ((1)frontal lobe, voxels placed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); (2)the occipital lobe; (3)the temporal lobe; (4)hippocampus; (5)striatum, including basal ganglia and caudate; (6)thalamus; (7)cerebellum; and (8)white matter). Measures were not available for all regions for all metabolites. Each study was only represented once in each subdomain. For studies reporting subgroups of high-risk states with a shared control group, measures were treated as separate data sets, and the number of healthy controls was divided by the number of subgroups (always two). In studies where bilateral measures were provided, measures from the left side were included in the analyses.

When the number of studies allowed (more than two studies available), subgroup analyses were performed based on high-risk status, treatment with antipsychotic medication, and location of the voxel of interest in the frontal lobe.
