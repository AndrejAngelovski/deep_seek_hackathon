1. Introduction
Pyrazoles are five-membered heterocycles that constitute a class of compounds particularly useful in organic synthesis. They are one of the most studied groups of compounds among the azole family. Indeed, a huge variety of synthesis methods and synthetic analogues have been reported over the years.

The presence of the pyrazole nucleus in different structures leads to diversified applications in different areas such as technology, medicine and agriculture. In particular, they are described as inhibitors of protein glycation, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antidepressant, antiinflammatory, anti-tuberculosis, antioxidant as well as antiviral agents [1,2].

Nowadays, pyrazole systems, as biomolecules, have attracted more attention due to their interesting pharmacological properties. This heterocycle can be traced in a number of well-established drugs belonging to different categories with diverse therapeutic activities (Figure 1) [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

In this review, we present descriptions and discussions on the most relevant synthesis methods and pharmacological properties of pyrazole-derived heterocyclic systems.

2. The Main Methods of Access to the Pyrazole Nucleus
Pyrazole is a π-excess aromatic heterocycle. Electrophilic substitution reactions occur preferentially at position 4 and nucleophilic attacks at positions 3 and 5 (Figure 2).

The pyrazoles diversely substituted by aromatic and heteroaromatic groups possess numerous biological activities, which makes them particularly interesting. The various access routes to the pyrazole nucleus have undergone numerous modifications since the first syntheses described by Knorr [11]. In this section, we will study this evolution and present the methods generally used to access substituted pyrazoles, that is to say:Cyclocondensation of hydrazine and similar derivatives with carbonyl systems.

Dipolar cycloadditions.

Multicomponent reactions.



2.1. Cyclocondensation of Hydrazine and Its Derivatives on 1,3-Difunctional Systems
The leading method used for obtaining substituted pyrazoles is a cyclocondensation reaction between an appropriate hydrazine acting as a bidentate nucleophile and a carbon unit like a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound, a 1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives or an α,β-unsaturated ketone (Figure 3).

2.1.1. From 1,3-Diketones
The cyclocondensation of the 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds with the hydrazine derivatives is a simple and rapid approach to obtain polysubstituted pyrazoles. The first synthesis of the substituted pyrazoles was carried out in 1883 by Knorr et al. [11] who reacted β-diketone 1 with hydrazine derivatives to give two regioisomers 2 and 3 (Scheme 1).

Girish et al. [12] described an efficient nano-ZnO catalyzed green protocol for the synthesis of 1,3,5-substituted pyrazoles derivatives 6 by condensation of phenylhydrazine 5 with ethyl acetoacetate (4) (Scheme 2). The main advantage of this protocol is the excellent yield (95%) achieved, short reaction time and easy work-up procedure. 

Similarly, Ohtsuka et al. [13] studied the condensation of phenylhydrazine 5 with the 2-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-diketone 7 in ethanol, affording 1,3,4,5-substituted pyrazole 8 in good yield (63%). Compound 8 was exclusively formed presumably owing to the fact that the sterically small NH2 is more nucleophilic than NHPh (Scheme 3).

Gosselin and co-workers have proposed new reaction conditions for the regioselective synthesis of 1,3-substituted 1-arylpyrazoles from 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds. Indeed, the authors have found that the cyclocondensation of an aryl hydrochloride hydrazine with 1,3-diketones in aprotic dipolar solvents gives better results than in the polar protic solvents (like ethanol) generally used for this type of reaction. After optimization of the conditions, the addition of a solution of HCl 10 N to the amide solvent (DMF, NMP, DMAc) or urea (DMPU, TMU) makes it possible to increase the yields by accelerating the dehydration steps. The cyclocondensation of the diketones with hydrazine thus takes place at ambient temperature in N,N-dimethylacetamide, in an acid medium, to give the corresponding pyrazoles with good yields and good regioselectivity. The condensation of various arylhydrazine with 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-arylbutan-1,3-diketones 9, afforded two isomers 11, 12 with 74–77% yields. The selectivity obtained is of the order of 98:2 in favor of the isomer 11. By comparison, the reactions carried out under conventional conditions in ethanol, at ambient temperature, give equimolar mixtures of the regioisomers. Nevertheless, a loss of control of the regioselectivity is observed when the CF3 group is replaced by a CH3 or CHF2. Finally, the condensations of aryl hydrazines with the 1,3-diketones 13 that are 2-substituted by an alkyl group give the trisubstituted pyrazoles 14 and 15 in 79–89% yields and a regioselectivity greater than 99.8:0.2 in favor of isomer 15 in all cases (Scheme 4) [14].

2.1.2. From Acetylenic Ketones
The cyclocondensation reaction of hydrazine derivatives 17 on acetylenic ketones 16 to form pyrazoles has been known for more than 100 years [15]. However, the reaction again results in a mixture of two regioisomers 18 and 19 (Scheme 5).

The diacetylene ketones 20 reacted with phenylhydrazine 5 in ethanol to give two regioisomeric pyrazoles 21 and 22. When phenylhydrazine was used, a mixture of regio-isomers 21/22 was generated in approximately 3:2 ratio. When hydrazine hydrate was used as the nucleophile, only regioisomer 21 was isolated, presumably due to hydrogen bonding to the ethyl ester group (Scheme 6) [16].

Guojing et al. reported a new efficient method for the synthesis of 3-trifluoromethylpyrazoles 25 with good yields via trifluoromethylation/cyclization of acetylenic ketones 25 on phenylhydrazine 5 using a hypervalent iodine reagent under transition-metal-free conditions. The optimal conditions were obtained when the ratio 24/Togni reagent was maintained at 1:1.3, giving 25 in 70% isolated yield (Scheme 7) [17].

Bishop et al. were interested in the factors determining the regioselectivity of this type of reaction in the framework of the synthesis of 3,5-diarylpyrazoles. They studied the cyclocondensation of acetylenic ketones 26 on methylhydrazine or aryl hydrazines in ethanol, which provides two difficultly separable regioisomeric pyrazoles 27 and 28 (Scheme 8) [18]. 

The difference in regioselectivity observed when using methylhydrazine (ratio 27/28 = 93:3 to 97:3) or an arylic hydrazine (ratio 28/27 = 87:13 to 99:1) is explained by the fact that the nitrogen carrying a methyl group is much more nucleophilic and will react by Michael addition on the triple bond of the acetylenic ketone followed by the intramolecular formation of an imine. In the case of a hydrazine substituted by an aryl group, the primary amine is the most nucleophilic and will react on the triple bond followed by the attack of the secondary amine on the carbonyl.

2.1.3. From Vinyl Ketones
The cyclocondensation reaction between an α,β-ethylenic ketone and a hydrazine derivative results in the synthesis of pyrazolines which, after oxidation, provide the pyrazole ring (Scheme 9).

Rao et al. described the condensation of an α,β-ethylenic ketone 29 with p-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)hydrazine 30 in the presence of copper triflate and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [bmim] (PF6) as catalysts, to access pyrazoline 31. The corresponding 1,3,5-trisubstituted pyrazole 32 was obtained after oxidation in situ of this pyrazoline. The reaction protocol gave 1,3,5-triarylpyrazoles in good yields (about 82%) via a one-pot addition–cyclocondensation between chalcones and arylhydrazines, and oxidative aromatization stands without the requirement of an additional oxidizing reagent. The catalyst can be reused more than four cycles without much loss in the catalytic activity (Scheme 10) [19].

On the other hand, Bhat et al. described a method for the synthesis of 3,5-diaryl-1H-pyrazoles from the reaction β-arylchalcones 33 with hydrogen peroxide that gave epoxides 34. Then, addition of hydrazine hydrate afforded pyrazoline intermediates 35, dehydration of which yielded desired 3,5-diaryl-1H-pyrazoles 36 (Scheme 11) [20].

Huang et al. developed a new regioselective synthesis of 4-alkyl-1,3,5-triarylpyrazoles for the preparation of unsymmetrically substituted systems of interest as ligands for the estrogen receptor. The condensation of hydrazines with α,β-ethylenic ketones 37 in DMF gave pyrazolines 38. However, the corresponding pyrazole derivatives 40 were obtained in good yield (66–88%) by alkylation of the pyrazolines 38 in the presence of LDA, before undergoing the oxidation reaction (Scheme 12) [21].

Similarly, a method for the synthesis of 1,3,5-trisubstituted pyrazoles from an α,β-ethylenic ketone was described. Cyclocondensation of the α,β-ethylenic ketone 41 with phenylhydrazine (1.2 eq.) 5 in acetic acid and in the presence of iodine (1.0 eq.) afforted the corresponding pyrazole 42 in good yield (70%) (Scheme 13) [22]. 

2.1.4. From Vinyl Ketones Having a Leaving Group
The α,β-ethylenic ketones having a leaving group may react with hydrazine derivatives to form pyrazolines which, after removal of the leaving group, provide the desired pyrazoles (Scheme 14).

5-Amino-3-phenylpyrazoles 44 were prepared from α-oxoketene O,N-acetals 43 using montmorillonite K-10 under sonication conditions [23]. The cyclocondensation of non-symmetrical enaminodicketones 46 on various hydrazine derivatives has been studied in the case of tert-butylhydrazine and carboxymethylhydrazine. The various pyrazoles 45 and 47 are obtained regiospecifically and in good yields (74–94%). It should be noted that in the case of carboxymethylhydrazine, the reaction leads directly to the corresponding NH-pyrazoles [24] (Scheme 15).

Katritzky et al. [25] described the synthesis of 1-methyl(aryl)-3-phenyl-5-alkyl(aryl)pyrazoles 50 by a regioselective condensation reaction of α-benzotriazolylenones 48 with methyl and phenylhydrazines. The intermediate pyrazolines 49 are then treated in a basic medium to give the expected pyrazoles in 50–94% yields after removal of benzotriazole. The advantage of using the benzotriazole group lies in the fact that the proton in the α-position is made more acidic and thus permits functionalization in the 4-position of the pyrazoline nucleus, thus allowing access to tetrasubstituted pyrazoles 50 (Scheme 16).

Alberola et al. [26] studied the regioselectivity of the reaction of various β-aminoenones on different monoalkyl, acetyl-, methoxycarbonyl-hydrazine and semicarbazide. Indeed, when the least bulky substituent is attached at the β position of the enone, high regioselectivity is obtained. This is the case of pyrazoles 51 and 52 which have been obtained with a regioselectivity greater than 90% from the reaction of alkylhydrazines (R1 = Me, t-Bu), in DMSO, with β-aminoenones 50a, 50b and 50c which possess the smallest group (CH3) in the β position (Scheme 17 and Table 1).

In the inverse case where the substituent in position β is the largest, the regioselectivity decreases. Indeed, when β-aminoenones 50a, 50b and 50c were replaced by their position isomers 50d, 50e and 50f in the previous reactions, a drop in regioselectivity was observed (Scheme 18 and Table 2).

This phenomenon is all the more important as R and alkylhydrazine are more voluminous. In this context, in order to increase the regioselectivity (to increase the ratio 54/53) several experimental attempts have been carried out and have suggested that the selectivity would be improved if the reactions are catalyzed by acetic acid and carried out in DMSO or in ethanol.

2.2. The 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition
Other methods allowing access to the pyrazole nucleus involve [3 + 2] cyloaddition reactions between an alkyne (or an olefin) and 1,3-dipolar compounds such as the diazo compounds, the sydnones or the nitrilimines.

2.2.1. Cycloaddition of Diazocarbonyl Compounds
He et al. [27] investigated the action of ethyl α-diazoacetate 56 on phenylpropargyl 55 in triethylamine and in the presence of zinc triflate as a catalyst; the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, leads to the corresponding pyrazole 57 in good yield (89%). The simple reaction conditions, straightforward procedure, synthetically useful products, good yielding, and easy manipulation make this method potentially useful in organic synthesis (Scheme 19).

Gioiello and co-workers described a facile one-pot procedure for the synthesis of pyrazole-5-carboxylates by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of ethyl diazoacetate 58 with α-methylene carbonyl 59 compounds utilizing 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as base and acetonitrile as solvent. Pyrazoles 60 and 61 were obtained with excellent regioselectivity and good yields. In particular, when 58 was reacted with 59 (with R1 = R2 = Ph) in the presence of 1.7 eq. of DBU in acetonitrile under argon atmosphere at room temperature, ethyl 3,4-diphenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate was obtained in 65% yield after flash chromatography. The reaction was found to proceed by a domino 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition water elimination (Scheme 20) [28].

Under the same conditions, the reaction of various aryl α-diazoarylacetacetates on methyl propionate led to the formation of two regioisomers 63 and 64. After cyclization, minor compound 64 (4–12%) is obtained by migration of the ester group on nitrogen atom. The majority compound 63 (77–90%) would be obtained by migration of the aryl group to the adjacent carbon atom followed by a prototropic rearrangement (Scheme 21) [29].

In another approach, Qi and Ready developed a direct and efficient access towards 3-acylpyrazoles 67 that involves the copper-promoted cycloaddition of acetylides 65 with diazocarbonyl compounds 66 under mild conditions. A wide variety of substituents is tolerated at both the acetylide and the diazo compound. The method is a rare example of an inverse-electron-demand cycloaddition (Scheme 22) [30]. 

2.2.2. The Sydnones
The pyrazoles ca obtained by a cycloaddition reaction of sydnones. Delaunay and co-workers presented the synthesis of the two regioisomeric 1,3,4,5-substituted pyrazoles 70 and 71 via a cycloaddition reaction between a sydnone 68 and alkyne 69. The reaction was completed within 15 h, giving rise to a 3:1 mixture of regioisomeric 5-iodopyrazoles 70 and 71 in 84% combined yield. The pyrazoles were easily separated by silica gel chromatography, and the structure assignment of the desired major isomer 70 (63% isolated yield) was made on the basis of the 1H-NMR spectrum [31] (Scheme 23).

On the other hand, Chen et al. [32] described the synthesis of a trisubstituted pyrazole 74, by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of arylsydnones 72 and α,β-unsaturated ketone 73 in dry xylene (Scheme 24).

2.2.3. Nitrilimines
Dadiboyena et al. described the synthesis of 1,3,5-trisubstituted pyrazole 78 by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of diphenylnitrilimine 75 with an alkene 76 in dichloromethane in the presence of triethylamine. The trisubstituted pyrazole 78, isolated in 88% yield, was the only product rather than the expected spiro-pyrazoline 77 (Scheme 25) [33]. 

Oh et al. reported the synthesis of the 1,3,5-substituted pyrazole 82 via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of a vinyl derivative 81 with the nitrilimine 80 generated in situ from an arylhydrazone 79. The reaction yielded the corresponding pyrazole in 72% yield. The protocol is simple and practical, employing economical and readily available reagents (Scheme 26) [34].

2.3. Multicomponent Approaches
2.3.1. In Situ Formation of Carbonyl Derivatives
Harigae and co-workers reported the preparation of 3,5-substituted pyrazole 86 in good yields (68–99%) with high regioselectivity in one pot by the treatment of terminal alkynes 83 with aromatic aldehydes 84, molecular iodine, and hydrazines. The present reaction is a simple and practical method for the preparation of various 1,3-disubstituted pyrazoles from easily available compounds (Scheme 27) [35].

1,3,4,5-Substituted pyrazole 90 was synthetized via a cyclocondensation reaction of arylhydrazine 89 and carbonyl derivatives 88 generated in situ from a ketone 87 and diethyl oxalate. The diketoesters 88 was converted into the desired 1,5-isomers 90 in the yields of 60–66%. Meanwhile, N-arylhydrazones 91 were obtained in the yields of 24–31% (Scheme 28) [36].

Lizuka and Kondo demonstrate palladocatalyzed carbonylation of acetylenic acids on aryl iodides 92 in the presence of hexacarbonyl molybdenum as a source of CO and tri-tert-butylphosphine as a palladium ligand, to similarly access 1,3,5-substituted pyrazoles 93 with excellent yields (58–94%). The one-pot formation of pyrazole in the presence of methylhydrazine was also successful and aryl iodides with electron withdrawing groups were easily converted into pyrazoles (Scheme 29) [37]. 

2.3.2. In Situ Formation of β-Aminoenones
Kovacs et al. developed a novel process for the synthesis of 3,5-substituted pyrazoles 97 via cuprocatalyzed coupling between an alkyne 95 and an oxime 94 in dimethylformamide, which provides the β-aminoenone 96. The valuable β-aminoenone was transformed into pyrazoles with the addition of hydrazine in a straightforward one-pot procedure; the product 97 was isolated with 70% yield (Scheme 30) [38].

2.3.3. In Situ Formation of a Hydrazone
Dang et al. described a novel reaction for the synthesis of pyrazole-3-carboxylates by one-pot cyclization of hydrazone dianions 98 with diethyl dioxalate 99. The cyclization of diethyl oxalate with the dianions of hydrazones 98 afforded the pyrazole-3-carboxylates 100 in good yields (53%) (Scheme 31) [39].

Lokhande et al. used the Vilsmeier-Haack reaction to synthesize carboxaldehyde pyrazoles 101. Condensation of a hydrazine 102 in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride gives the 4-formyl pyrazole (Scheme 32) [40].

1,3,4,5-Substituted pyrazoles 105 were regioselectively synthesized in modest to good yields (26–92%) by Deng and Mani from hydrazone 103 and a nitroolefin 104 in methanol [41]. As a result of this work, the same authors proposed another strategy for synthesis based on the use of the same substrates and selectively leading to 1,3,4-substituted pyrazoles. In this new approach, the cyclocondensation of nitroolefins 104 with hydrazones 103 is carried out using a strong base such as t-BuOK. After treatment with a strong acid, the desired pyrazole 105 is obtained in the form of a single regioisomer in excellent yields (42–88%) (Scheme 33) [42]. 

2.3.4. In Situ Formation of Diazo Compounds
The Aggarwal team has developed a multicomponent process in which diazo 107 derivatives are generated in situ from various aldehydes 106 and tosylhydrazines, thus limiting the risks associated with the isolation of these compounds. These are then used in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction to give corresponding pyrazoles 108 and 109 Diazo compounds derived from aldehydes were reacted with terminal alkynes to furnish regioselectively 3,5-disubstituted pyrazoles in 24–67% yields. Furthermore, the reaction of N-vinylimidazole and diazo compounds derived from aldehydes gave exclusively 3-substituted pyrazoles in a one-pot process with 32–79% yields (Scheme 34) [43].

2.4. From Heterocyclic Systems
2.4.1. From the Pyranones
Pyranones are among the most widely used heterocycles for the preparation of pyrazoles. The condensation of 2,3-dihydro-4H-pyran-4-ones 110 with arylhydrazines in ethanol and in the presence of montmorillonite KSF as catalyst, gives access to 5-substituted pyrazoles 111 in yields of (57–86%) (Scheme 35) [44]. Similarly, Xie et al. have developed a general method for the synthesis of pyrazoles. This involves the use of Suzuki coupling of arylboronic acids with chromones 112, followed by the action of hydrazine hydrate, yields the corresponding 3,4-diarylpyrazoles 113 in a yield of 48–95% (Scheme 35) [45].

Similarly, reaction of pyranones derivatives 114, 116, 118 and 120 with hydrazine in ethanol the give corresponding pyrazoles 115, 117, 119 and 121 respectively (Scheme 36) [46,47,48,49].

2.4.2. From Furandiones
Ilham et al. [50] carried out condensation in refluxing benzene, furan-2,3-diones 126 with arylhydrazines, allowing access to pyrazole-3-hydrazides 127 in acceptable to good yields (45–65%) (Scheme 37). Similarly, condensation of furan-2,3-dione 128 with N-benzylidene-N′-(4-nitrophenyl) hydrazine afforted 4-benzoyl-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid 129 in a 45% yield (Scheme 37) [51].

2.4.3. From Pyrimidines and Pyrimidones
3-Cyano-4-trifluoromethyl-6-aryl-2(1H)-pyridones 126 react with hydrazine hydrate under reflux to give 5-trifluoromethyl-3-arylpyrazoles 127 in 45–65% yields (Scheme 38) [52]. Similarly, the reaction of 3,5-diacyl-1,4-dihydropyridine 128 with hydrazine in ethanol at 140 °C afforded bis-pyrazolyl methanes 129 in good yields (Scheme 38) [53].

2.4.4. From Imidazole
Cycloaddition of (5Z)-1-acyl-5-(cyanomethylidene)-3-methylimidazolidine-2,4-diones 130 with arylhydrazonyl chloride under basic conditions to give pyrazole-5-carboxamides 131 in moderate 27–40% yields (Scheme 39) [54].

2.4.5. From Oxazoles
5-Trifluoromethyl-3-hydroxypyrazoles 132 were obtained in good yield (46–95%) by heating phenylhydrazine and 4-trifluoroacetyl-1,3-oxazolium-5-olates 133 under reflux of benzene (Scheme 40) [55].

2.4.6. From Tetrazoles
Cyanopyrazoles 135 are readily prepared from tetrazolo[1,5-b]pyridazines, tetrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidines, or tetrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines. Tetrazolyl acroleins 134 reacts with fumaronitrile in xylene at 140 °C to give the corresponding pyrazole formation 135 (Scheme 41) [56].

2.4.7. From Triazines
Rykowski et al. [57] proposed a synthesis of pyrazoles, based on the condensation of 3-chloro-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazines 136 on α-chlorosulfonyls in the presence of potassium hydroxide for obtain the corresponding pyrazoles 137 (Scheme 42).

2.4.8. From 1,5-Benzodiazepin-2-one
Ferfra et al. [58] prepared pyrazole from benzodiazepine-2-thione in one step. They opened the seven-membered ring by reacting hydrazine with benzodiazepine-2-thione 138 to give o-aminophenylaminopyrazole 139 (Scheme 43).

2.4.9. From Other Heterocycles
Substituted pyrazoles 141 were synthesized in high yields through the condensation reaction of (Z)-3-Acetyl-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-2-ol 140 with arylhydrazines in a mixture of water and acetic acid (Scheme 44) [59].

Similarly, condensation of ethyl-1-amino-6,7-difluorooxoquinolin-4-one-3-carboxylate 142 with pentane-2,4-dione in acetic acid at reflux afforded 1-(2-acetyl-4,5-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-4-acetylpyrazole 143 (Scheme 45) [60].

5-Aminopyrazoles 145 were obtained in good yield by heating of 3-methyl-6H-1,3,4-thiadiazine 146 under reflux of acetic acid (Scheme 46) [61].

On the other hand, the reaction of nitropyrimidine 146 with arylhydrazines in methanol at room temperature, to afford 4-nitro-3,5-diaminopyrazoles 147 in yields of 21–61% (Scheme 47) [62]. 

Suen et al. prepared a series of substituted 1H-pyrazoles 150 by condensing thietanone 148 with 1,2,4,5-tetrazines 149 in the presence of potassium hydroxide (Scheme 48) [63]. 

3. Pharmacological Activities
3.1. Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity
Akbas et al. synthesized of series 1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives (Figure 4) and evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. The results showed that the compound 151 was the best compound in the series, exhibiting antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [64]. A series of new pyrazoles containing a quinolinyl chalcone group were synthesized and assessed for antibacterial activity. Compound 152 was the most potent against bacterial and fungal strains [65]. A series of pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and pyrazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acid derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against five bacterial and five fungal pathogens. However, only the molecules 153, 154, 155 and 156 demonstrated some inhibitory effects on Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata strains [66]. Rahimizadeh et al. reported the synthesis and antibacterial activity of a series of 5-amido-1-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitriles. Results showed that the compound 157 exhibit antimicrobial activities against methicillin susceptible S. aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus with MIC values of 25.1 µM [67]. 

A series of pyrazole derivatives were synthesized and screened for their antibacterial properties against S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa.

3.11. Agrochemical Activity
In the past few years, the interest in pyrazole derivatives has increased due to their proven usefulness as intermediates in the preparation of new biological materials. Specifically, pyrazole derivatives have a long history of application in the agrochemical industry as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and acaracides. The pyrazole ring is present in many agrochemically important compounds, such as the pesticides, furametpyr [388], cyantraniliprole [389], cyenopyrafen [390], tebufenpyrad [391], tolfenpyrad [392], and fenpyroximate [388] (Figure 49).

Especially, the foliar contact activity against bean aphid of compound 507 at 2.5 mg/kg was 89% [404].

4. Conclusions
Pyrazoles represent a major pharmacophore with various biological properties, and some pyrazole-containing derivatives have already been used for therapeutic purposes. This literature review shows that pyrazole derivatives are pharmacologically very potent and, therefore, their design and synthesis is the potential area of research. It has been noted so far that the structural modifications of the basic structure of pyrazole, have allowed the preparation of new derivatives with a broad spectrum of biological activity, with the most important structural variations concerning the substituents at the 1-position, the carbon at the 3-position and the substituent at the 5-position. Previous studies have shown that the structural modification on the different positions of the basic molecule allows for improving its pharmacological profile, giving it antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-malarial and anti-cancer properties. For the moment, researchers have been drawn to the design of more potent pyrazole derivatives having great diversity of biological activity.
