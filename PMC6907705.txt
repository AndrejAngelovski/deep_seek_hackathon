Cognitive deficits in Parkinson’s disease typically affect executive functions.
Recently, the concept of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has been related to PD
(PD-MCI). PD-MCI is considered a transition phase to Parkinson’s disease
Dementia. Therefore, it is important to identify PD-MCI in a reliable way.
Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the INECO Frontal
Screening (IFS) in detecting cognitive deficits in PD-MCI. Additionally, we
compare the IFS and the Addenbrook Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) between
three groups; PD-MCI, MCI, and controls. Methods: The IFS and ACE-R were
administered to 36 patients with PD-MCI, 31 with MCI (amnestic-multidomain
subtype) and 92 healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were determined
using ROC analysis. The groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance.
Results: The IFS had adequate accuracy in differentiating patients with PD-MCI
from healthy controls (AUC=0.77, sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.77), and good
accuracy in differentiating PD-MCI from MCI patients (AUC=0.80,
sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.61). However the IFS had low accuracy in
differentiating MCI patients from healthy controls (AUC=0.47, sensitivity=0.52,
specificity=0.41). On the ACE-R, the PD-MCI group had low performance in Fluency
and Language. Only patients with PD-MCI had difficulties on the IFS,
specifically in inhibitory control and visual working memory. This dysexecutive
profile explains the sensitivity and specificity values found in the IFS.
Conclusion: The present study results suggest that the IFS is a suitable
screening tool for exploring cognitive dysfunction in PD-MCI, especially in
those patients with a dysexecutive profile.

RESUMO
Os déficits cognitivos na doença de Parkinson geralmente afetam as funções
executivas. Recentemente, o conceito de Comprometimento Cognitivo Leve (CCL) tem
sido relacionado à DP (DP-CCL). O DP-CCL é considerado uma fase de transição
para a doença de Parkinson. Portanto, é importante identificar o DP-CCL de
maneira acurada. Objetivo: Avaliar a sensibilidade e especificidade do
INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) na detecção de déficits
cognitivos na DP-CCL. Além disso, comparamos o IFS e o Addenbrook
Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) entre três grupos; DP-CCL,
CCL e controles. Métodos: O IFS e o ACE-R foram administrados a 36 pacientes com
DP-CCL, 31 com CCL (subtipo amnésico-de múltiplos domínios) e 92 controles
saudáveis. A sensibilidade e especificidade foram determinadas usando a análise
ROC. Os grupos foram comparados usando uma análise de variância unidirecional.
Resultados: O IFS teve precisão adequada para diferenciar pacientes com DP-CCL
de controles saudáveis ​​(AUC=0, 77, sensibilidade=0, 82, especificidade=0, 77)
e boa precisão para diferenciar DP-CCL de CCL (AUC=0, 80, sensibilidade =0, 82,
especificidade=0, 61). No entanto, o IFS teve baixa precisão para diferenciar
CCL de controles saudáveis ​​(AUC=0, 47, sensibilidade=0, 52, especificidade=0,
41). No ACE-R, o grupo DP-CCL apresentou baixo desempenho em fluência e
linguagem. Somente pacientes com DP-CCL apresentaram dificuldades no IFS,
especificamente no controle inibitório e na memória de trabalho visual. Esse
perfil disexecutivo explica os valores de sensibilidade e especificidade
encontrados no IFS. Conclusão: O presente estudo sugeriu que o IFS é uma
ferramenta de triagem adequada para explorar a disfunção cognitiva na DP-CCL,
principalmente naqueles pacientes com perfil disexecutivo.

==== Body
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identifies a transitional phase from cognitive changes of
normal aging to those typically found in dementia, but with preserved activities of
daily living.1 The prevalence of MCI ranges from 7
to 47.9%, with a worldwide average prevalence of 18.9 per 1000 population.1 Previous studies have shown that the annual
conversion rate from MCI to Alzheimer disease (AD) was 10-15% and that approximately 50%
of MCI patients will convert to AD within 4 years.2 Therefore, MCI is considered a transition phase from normal aging to
AD.2


A few years ago, the concept of MCI was related to Parkinson’s disease (PD-MCI).3 Studies suggested that PD-MCI may represent the
earliest stage of cognitive decline and may be a risk factor for developing Parkinson’s
disease Dementia (PDD).4
,
5 Previous research estimated the prevalence of
PD-MCI as lying in the range of 15% to 53% in PD.6
Diagnosing PD-MCI is an important issue because it predicts the development of
dementia.7


The study of MCI and PD-MCI poses several challenges from a methodological point of view.
Perhaps the most important is related to the presence of common risk factors for both
pathologies. For example, age is one of the most important risk factors for the
development of MCI, 1 whilePD is generally
considered a disorder of older age, affecting between 1% and 2% of individuals older
than 60 years.8


Usually, the investigations that are carried out in patients with PD-MCI presumethat the
presence of cognitive decline is the result of the PD. However, we should bear in mind
that the person exhibiting cognitive decline (possibly PD-MCI) would show signs of
deterioration before receiving the diagnosis of PD, especially if the disease is
diagnosed after the age of 60. The current results show that although the cognitive
deficits present in AD and PD are heterogeneous, 9
,
10 there are cognitive impairment patterns that
distinguish both pathologies. For example, cognitive deficits in PD typically affect
executive functions, processing speed, attention and visuospatial abilities, 11 unlike AD, in which the main deficits are
amnestic.9 In this sense, it is imperative to
characterize PD-MCI not only in relation to PD without cognitive deterioration and PDD,
but also to explore the cognitive characteristics that distinguish PD-MCI from MCI
related to Alzheimer Disease.

There is also a need to validate the neuropsychological tests used to diagnose cognitive
deficits associated with PD-MCI.3 Most studies
published to date have used global batteries such as the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive
Examination Battery (ACE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale Second Edition (DRS-2) and
Parkinson’s Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS).11
,
12 These batteries are useful for obtaining a
general picture of cognition in PD-MCI patients, but can also hinder the defining of
deficits in specific cognitive dimensions (for example, executive dysfunctions).12
,
13


There is currently evidence that the INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) has good psychometric
properties, including high internal consistency, for neurodegenerative pathologies, such
as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)14 and behavioral
variant frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD).15 In a
sample of dementia patients and control subjects, Ihnen & Antivilo16 reported evidence of convergent validity showing
significant correlations between the IFS and other instruments, such as the Frontal
Assesment Battery, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. For
diagnostic accuracy, a cut-off point of 18 points (sensitivity=0.903; specificity=0.867)
and an area under the curve of 0.951 was estimated for distinguishing between patients
with dementia and control subjects. IFS has also shown utility in distinguishing
patients with dysexecutive syndrome (bv-FTD) from patients with depression. A study
conducted by Fiorentino, Gleichgerrcht17 revealed
that the IFS had superior discriminatory accuracy (AUC=0.97) than both the MMSE
(AUC=0.88) and ACE-R (AUC=0.93) in discriminating healthy controls from patient groups. 

The IFS is an easy-to-administer instrument for assessing several domains of executive
function in a short time. The IFS comprises eight subtests arranged in three main
domains of executive functions: 1) response inhibition and set-shifting, 2) working
memory, and 3) capacity of abstraction.16
Additionally, performance on the IFS appears to be relatively independent of global
cognitive functioning, suggesting specificity of IFS for executive functioning.18


The IFS had been used previously in PD patients with and without mild cognitive
impairment (PD-MCI and PD-nMCI, respectively).19
,
20 In these studies, the sensitivity and
specificity of the IFS in comparison with the MoCa was not determined. In this sense, it
remains unclear whether the IFS is also a useful tool for exploring the features which
distinguish PD-MCI from MCI related to Alzheimer Disease. 

In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the INECO Frontal Screening
for detecting executive deficits in PD-MCI. Additionally, we compare the INECO Frontal
Screening between three groups, PD-MCI, MCI, and controls.

METHODS
Participants
A total of 159 participants were evaluated in the period from January to
September 2016. The sample was divided into 3 groups, comprising 31 patients
with MCI, 36 patients with PD-MCI and 92 cognitively healthy controls. The
participants included in the three groups were selected according to the
criteria outlined below.

MCI-PD Group. Diagnosis of Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, based on the UK PD
Brain Bank criteria, 21 was established
by a neurologist. Two clinical psychologists with neuropsychology training
evaluated patients. Level I diagnosis of PD-MCI was established according to the
MDS PD-MCI criteria22 if either the
patient or an informant reported a cognitive decline, and using an abbreviated
neuropsychological assessment. Patients were evaluated using the MMSE (patients
scoring below 24 points were included). 

MCI Group (amnestic-multidomain subtype). We employed the criteria proposed by
Petersen:23 significant impairment of
the patient and/or caregiver’s report with objective evidence of memory decline
compared to equivalent controls for age, sex, and years of education; Clinical
Dementia Rating scale [CDR] score of 0.5, ACE-R scores<85 according to Cuban
validation study, 24 and preservation of
activities of daily living. Subjects with potential causes of cognitive decline
other than neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease (e.g. depression,
schizophrenia, epilepsy, head injury, alcoholism) were excluded. The ACE-R was
used to determine MCI subtype, classifying the sample as amnestic-multidomain
MCI subtype.

Control Group. The criteria for the control group were as follows: a score >85
on the ACE-R,24 no subjective memory
complaints, preserved functioning in activities of daily living. Healthy
controls had no neurological or psychiatric disorders.

None of the participants included in the study showed clinical signs of
depression (Geriatric Depression Scale <5)25 or anxiety (Zung Anxiety Scale <51).26 Subjects with severe sensory deficits (vision or
hearing) were also excluded.

Instruments
The Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R)27 consists of 5 components evaluating different cognitive
domains, with separate scores: attention/orientation (18 points), memory (26
points), verbal fluency (14 points), language (26 points) and visuospatial
functions (16 points), with a maximum score of 100 as the sum of scores of all
domains. 

INECO Frontal Screening (IFS)15 is a
neuropsychological exam to detect executive dysfunction in neurodegenerative
pathologies. The tasks included in the IFS are Luria motor
series (3 points), Conﬂicting instructions (3
points), Go-no go (3 points), Months backwards
(2 points), Backwards digit span (6 points), Modified
Corsi tapping test (4 points), Proverb
interpretation (3 points) and Modified Hayling
Test (6 points). The IFS has a maximum possible score of 30 points.
High scores indicate preservation of executive functions.28


Procedure and analysis of data
All participants received a full explanation of the research objective and
subsequently signed the informed consent form. The cognitive evaluations were
carried out by two clinical psychologists with neuropsychology training. The
data were obtained observing the regulations of the Ethics Committee of the
Universidad Central “Marta Abreu” de Las Villas, and in compliance with the
Helsinki Declaration for Human Research.

The data were processed using SPSS/Windows, version 21. The three groups were
compared using one-way analysis of variance and post-hoc comparisons using the
Tukey HSD test. Effect sizes were calculated using partial eta squared (η2
partial). Cohen classifies .01 as a small effect, .06 as a medium
effect and .14 as a large effect.29
Linear regression was used to evaluate the effects of age and education on total
scores of the ACE-R and INECO Frontal Screening. The values of sensitivity and
specificity between groups were determined by the receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) curve.

RESULTS
Demographics of PD-MCI, MCI and Control Groups
The present study included 36 patients with PD-MCI, 31 patients with MCI
diagnosis and 92 cognitively healthy controls. The results of the comparison of
demographics in the three groups are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age or years of
education among the three groups. Our results showed that, globally, age had no
influence on the ACE-R (β=-0.024, p=0.77) or INECO Frontal
Screening (β=-0.080, p=0.32), whereas years of education had a
positive linear influence on the ACE-R (β=0.350, p<0.001)
and INECO Frontal Screening (β=0.339, p=0.001).

Validity of IFS for PD-MCI compared to ACE-R

Figure 1 depicts ROC curves of the ACE-R
(total score) and INECO Frontal Screening (total score) for detecting: a) MCI;
and b) PD-MCI. When comparing MCI patients with the control group, the area
under the ROC curve of the ACE-R was 0.92 (cutoff=84; sensitivity=0.90;
specificity=0.76), while the area under the ROC curve of the IFS was 0.47
(cutoff=11; sensitivity=0.52; specificity=0.41) (Table 3). The same analysis was conducted between PD-MCI and
controls. The results showed that the area under the ROC curve of the ACE-R for
MCI-PD patients was 0.90 (cutoff=76; sensitivity=0.82; specificity=0.77), while
the area under the ROC curve of the IFS was 0.77 (cutoff=21; sensitivity=0.90;
specificity=0.72).

An additional analysis was conducted comparing the IFS subtest between the two
groups. The results showed that the area under the ROC curve of the
Go-No go subtest between PD-MCI/MCI patients was 0.66
(cutoff=0.5; sensitivity=0.85; specificity=0.38), while the area under the ROC
curve of the Modified Corsi Tapping test was 0.77 (cutoff=0.5;
sensitivity=0.97; specificity=0.77). Finally, the area under the ROC curve of
the Modified Hayling Test was 0.80 (cutoff=0.5;
sensitivity=0.94; specificity=0.70).

Neuropsychological performance among PD-MCI, MCI and Control Groups
The results of the comparison of neuropsychological batteries among the three
groups are shown in Table 3. Post-hoc
comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that mean MMSE scores differed
significantly between both clinical groups (PD-MCI and MCI) in comparison to the
healthy group (p<0.001). The MCI group had a significantly
lower score on the MMSE compared to the PD-MCI group
(p<0.001).

The means cores on the Attention and Orientation domain of the
ACE-R showed significant differences in the MCI patient groups compared to the
PD and Control groups (p<0.001). Patients with MCI performed
worse than PD-MCI patients and healthy controls on the memory component of the
ACE-R tests (p<0.001). Fluency scores also
differed among the three groups. The mean score for the PD-MCI group differed
significantly from the score in the MCI group (p<0.001). The
control group also differed significantly from both MCI and PD-MCI groups
(p<0.001).

The post-hoc comparisons also revealed differences among the three groups on the
language domain. However, patients with PD-MCI had significantly lower scores on
the language domain than MCI patients and cognitively healthy controls
(p<0.001). Concerning the performance on the
visuospatial component of the ACE-R, patients with PD-MCI and MCI performed
worse than healthy controls (p<0.001), although there were
no differences between these two groups (PD-MCI vs. MCI;
p=0.98). Regarding differences in the ACE-R total
score, both the PD-MCI and MCI groups performed worse than healthy
controls (p<0.001), but no differences between them were
found (PD-MCI vs. MCI; p=0.80).

No significant differences among groups were found on the INECO Frontal Screening
for the following subtest: Luria motor series,
conflicting instructions, backward digit
span, months backward and proverb
interpretation (Table 2).
Post-hoc comparisons revealed significant differences on the Go-No go
task, Modified Corsi tapping test,
Modified Hayling test, and IFS total
score. 

The PD-MCI patients had significantly lower scores on the Go-No go
task relative to MCI patients (p=0.012) and
cognitively healthy controls (p=0.03). No significant
differences between the MCI and control groups were found
(p=0.95). On the Modified Corsi tapping test,
the PD-MCI group had significantly lower scores than the MCI group and controls
(p<0.001). No differences were found between MCI
patients and controls on this subtest (p=0.41). Significant
differences were found on the Modified Hayling test and
Total IFS between the PD-MCI group and the other two
groups, while no significant differences between the MCI and control groups were
found for these two variables.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the INECO Frontal
Screening in detecting cognitive deficits in PD-MCI. Additionally, we compared
cognitive performance on the INECO Frontal Screening among the three groups: PD-MCI,
MCI, and controls. 

Concerning the usefulness of the ACE-R and the INECO Frontal Screening, it was found
that in MCI patients, the ACE-R possessed a high sensitivity and diagnostic
specificity. These results confirm previous findings reporting the clinical utility
of ACE-R in the diagnosis of MCI.30 However,
the IFS showed low sensitivity and specificity for the MCI group.

Both the ACE-R and the IFS showed adequate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for
the detection of the cognitive deficits present in the PD-MCI patients in comparison
with healthy controls. There is current evidence that Addenbrooke’s Cognitive
Examination Revised (ACE-R) and the ACE-III have very good diagnostic sensitivity
for cognitive decline in Parkinson disease.31
-
35 In the study conducted by Reyes et al.,
31 a cut-off point of 83 points was
reported (sensitivity=92%; specificity=91%;) to detect cognitive deficits in PD. Our
results showed a similar cut-off point to distinguish PD-MCI from healthy controls,
with high sensitivity (sensitivity=0.90), but lower specificity (specificity=0.76)
compared to the study of Reyes et al.31 This
may be because we used a sample of patients who met the specific clinical criteria
for the diagnosis of PD-MCI, while the cited study used a sample of patients with
PD, not specifying the type of cognitive deficit present in the sample. In another
study conducted by McColgan et al.34 the
sensitivity and specificity of the ACE-R for detecting PD-MCI were 69% and 84%,
respectively, with a cut-off score of 89 points. Recently, Berankova et al.35 reported that the ACE-R had a cut-off score
of 85.5 points (sensitivity: 68%, specificity: 91%) in discriminating PD-MCI from PD
with normal cognition and 82.5 points (sensitivity: 70%, specificity: 73%) in
discriminating PD-MCI from PDD.35


Compared to the ACE-R, the IFS showed better sensitivity and specificity when
discriminating between the patients from the PD-MCI groups and the MCI patients. In
particular, the IFS sub-tests that showed the best sensitivity and diagnostic
specificity were those related to the processes of visual working memory and
inhibitory control. This result may be related to the fact that cognitive
deterioration in PD begins with impairments on tests that are sensitive to frontal
lobe dysfunction, and then progresses with deficits on tests that involve more
posterior cortical areas.36


In our results, the ACE-R showed low precision for discriminating between PD-MCI and
MCI associated with Alzheimer’s (cut-off=43; sensitivity=0.52; specificity=0.56),
while the area under the ROC curve of the IFS was 0.80 (cut-off=18,
sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.61). Other investigations have indicated that the
IFS may be used as a screening test for executive dysfunction in other
neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer Disease (AD)14
,
37 and behavioral variant Frontotemporal
Dementia (bv-FTD).17


The tasks that showed the greatest ability to discriminate between PD-MCI and MCI
patients are those that explore inhibitory control (Go-No Go and Modified Hayling
test)and visual working memory (Modified Corsi tapping test). With regard to working
memory, there are previous studies reporting that patients with mild-to-moderate PD
were impaired on a test of visuospatial WM, while their performance on an analogous
test of verbal WM was unaffected.38
,
39


In the case of the inhibitory control evaluated by the IFS using the Modified Hayling
test, our results confirm the findings obtained by other studies that have explored
patients with PDD. For example, a recent study investigated inhibitory control in
people with Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) and patients with Parkinson’s disease
using the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT). According to some authors, the
inhibitory control difficulties present in patients with Parkinson’s disease could
be a characteristic with prognostic value to determine the risk of dementia.40


In relation to the second objective of the study, significant differences were found
in MCI group compared with the other groups, in the Attention and Orientation
domains, and Memory. The difficulties found in Language and the global score on the
ACE-R did not differ from those attained by the PD-MCI group, but were both worse
than the performance shown by the control group. The results obtained support the
presence of a continuum of cognitive function within the concept of MCI, even when
the main impairment affects memory.2


In PD-MCI patients, difficulties were detected in the fluency and language domains
evaluated by the ACE-R, results that were significant in comparison with the other
groups. These results support the findings of other studies reporting deficits in
language among patients with PD. Previous research indicates difficulties in several
processes related to language, such as processing action-related verbs, 41 sentences42 and deficits in the appraisal of action meanings evoked by
naturalistic texts.19


Regarding the results achieved on the INECO Frontal Screening, difficulties were
found in the executive functions by the PD-MCI groups that were significant in
comparison with the other groups included in the study. The executive tasks on which
the PD-MCI patients had difficulties were related to inhibitory control and visual
working memory. Additionally, total score on the IFS was statistically lower in the
PD-MCI group than the MCI or healthy groups. The MCI group presented no difficulties
on any of the executive domains evaluated by the IFS, showing similar performance
compared to healthy controls.

Our results are consistent with other studies assessing the most common MCI subtypes
and their associations with later development of dementia in PD.13 While in MCI cases with memory deficits
predominate, in PD-MCI most patients present the non-amnestic subtype exhibiting
impairments in a range of cognitive domains, such as executive function, attention,
processing speed, visuospatial ability, among others.6

44 This variety of affected functions could
be related to the brain dysfunction patterns that have been proven in PD-MCI
patients, characterized by hippocampus, prefrontal, occipital, and parietal brain
atrophy.45
,
46 In our study, the cognitive profile that
characterized the patients was dysexecutive. This dysexecutive profile found in
PD-MCI patients is a factor that allows us to explain the values ​​of diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity described for the IFS.

The present study had some limitations. First, our PD-MCI and MCI samples are
relatively small, with only 36 PD-MCI cases, and 31 MCI patients. In future studies,
large samples are needed to confirm statistically significant differences between
diagnostic instruments. Second, we were unable to explore the relationship between
neuropsychological assessments and other biomarkers in the MCI and PD-MCI patients
because of economic and technological limitations. Consequently, the clinical
diagnosis of MCI and PD-MCI were based on a comprehensive diagnostic procedure as
the ultimate gold standard. 

In conclusion, this is the first study comparing performance on the IFS in subjects
with MCI related to Alzheimer’s disease, PD-MCI patients, and healthy older
controls. Our results showed that the IFS has a low capacity for discriminating
between patients with MCI and healthy controls, while the ACE-R possesses a high
diagnostic capacity to differentiate between these groups. In PD-MCI patients, both
the IFS and the ACE-R have high sensitivity and diagnostic specificity when compared
with healthy controls.

The ACE-R did not display discriminatory capacity to differentiate between PD-MCI
patients and MCI related to Alzheimer’s disease. The IFS had adequate capacity to
discriminate between PD-MCI and MCI patients related to Alzheimer’s disease,
specifically the subtests of visual working memory and inhibitory control. These
results suggest that the joint use of IFS and global screening tools for the
cognitive investigation of PD-MCI would allow detection of the cognitive deficits
present in these patients, facilitating early intervention and preventing MCI
conversion to dementia. 

This study was conducted at the Psychology Department, Universidad Central “Marta
Abreu” de Las Villas, Santa Clara, Cuba.
