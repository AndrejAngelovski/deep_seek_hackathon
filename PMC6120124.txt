dysregulation is implicated in multiple neurological disorders. While
environmental risk factors have been identified, it remains unclear to what
extent the flow is regulated by genetics. Here we performed heritability and
genome-wide association analyses of cerebral blood flow in a population-based
cohort study. We included 4472 persons free of cortical infarcts who underwent
genotyping and phase-contrast magnetic resonance flow imaging (mean age
64.8 ± 10.8 years). The flow rate, cross-sectional area of the vessel, and flow
velocity through the vessel were measured in the basilar artery and bilateral
carotids. We found that the flow rate of the basilar artery is most heritable
(h2 (SE) = 24.1 (9.8), p-value = 0.0056), and this increased
over age. The association studies revealed two significant loci for the right
carotid artery area (rs12546630,
p-value = 2.0 × 10−8) and velocity (rs2971609,
p-value = 1.4 × 10−8), with the latter showing a
concordant effect in an independent sample (N = 1350,
p-value = 0.057, meta-analyzed
p-value = 2.5 × 10−9). These loci were also
associated with other cerebral blood flow parameters below genome-wide
significance, and rs2971609 lies in a known migraine locus. These findings
establish that cerebral blood flow is under genetic control with potential
relevance for neurological diseases.

==== Body
Introduction
The cerebral circulation consists of an intricate system of blood vessels that supply
the brain with nutrients. The flow of blood to the brain parenchyma is tightly
regulated,1–3 with deviations
from this resulting in functional impairments. Both ischemia and hyperemia are
associated with neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease,4 other neurodegenerative disorders,5 stroke,6 and small vessel disease.7 It is therefore imperative to identify factors that influence cerebral blood
flow.

Numerous environmental factors have been associated with cerebral blood flow, among
which are physical activity,8 psychological stress,9 and high altitude.10 Some studies have also hinted at an influence of genetics, with reports of
cerebral blood flow dysregulation in mutation carriers of diseases, such as the
COMT Val158Met mutation11 and HTT CAG repeats.12 However, the extent to which genetics contributes to the variability in
cerebral blood flow is yet to be determined. Furthermore, only small candidate gene
studies have been published, while there have been no reports of unbiased
genome-wide studies. Identification of genetic variants associated with cerebral
blood flow could provide insight into neurological disorders that are related to
flow abnormalities.

Here we systematically map the heritability of cerebral blood flow in a large,
population-based cohort study, followed by genome-wide association studies and
independent replication.

Material and methods
Study population
This study was embedded in the Rotterdam Study,13 a Dutch population-based cohort study including a total of 14,926
participants who were aged 45 years or over at enrolment. The cohort was
designed to investigate causes and determinants of chronic diseases in the
elderly, although participants were not selected for the presence of diseases or
risk factors. The participants were recruited in three batches: in 1990 (RS-I),
in 2000 (RS-II), and in 2006 (RS-III). Genotyping was successfully performed in
11,496 participants of European descent. Since 2005, all participants underwent
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the causes and consequences of
age-related brain changes.14 Until 2013, a total of 5806 unique individuals were scanned, of which
4864 had genetic data available. The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the
institutional review board of Erasmus MC University Medical Center (Medical
Ethics Committee), in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (and
revised in 1983), and in accordance with the Population Study Act Rotterdam
Study, executed by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports of the
Netherlands. All participants provided written informed consent to participate
in the study and to obtain information from their treating physicians.

Genotyping
Genotyping was performed with the Illumina 550 K, 550 K duo, and 610 quad arrays.13 We then removed samples with call rate below 97.5%, gender mismatch,
excess autosomal heterozygosity, duplicates or family relations and ancestry
outliers, and variants with call rate below 95.0%, failing missingness test,
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium p-value <10−6, and
minor allele frequency <1%. Genotypes were imputed to the 1000 Genomes phase
I version 3 reference panel (all population) by using the MACH/minimac software.15

Image acquisition and processing
MRI scanning was performed on a dedicated 1.5-T MRI unit with an eight-channel
head coil (Signa HD platform, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, USA). The MRI protocol
included high-resolution axial sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid
attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)), as well as 2D phase-contrast imaging. A
detailed description of the MRI protocol was presented
elsewhere.14 All scans were visually inspected by trained raters for cortical infarcts
and, if present, the scan was excluded since infarcts may have a large effect on
the measurements of cerebral blood flow (N = 196).

For cerebral blood flow measurement, 2D phase-contrast imaging was performed as
described previously.16 In short, a sagittal 2D phase-contrast MRI angiographic scout image was
performed. On this scout image, a transverse imaging plane perpendicular to both
the precavernous portion of the internal carotid arteries and the middle part of
the basilar artery was chosen for a 2D gradient-echo phase-contrast sequence
(repetition time = 20 ms, echo time = 4 ms, field of
view = 19 × 19 cm2, matrix = 256 × 160, flip angle = 8°, NEX = 8,
bandwidth = 22.73 kHz, velocity encoding = 120 cm/s, slice thickness = 5 mm).
Acquisition time was 51 s and no cardiac gating was performed.17 Measures of cerebral blood flow were derived from the phase-contrast
images by using interactive data language-based custom software (Cinetool
version 4; General Electric Healthcare). Two experienced MRI technicians
manually marked the basilar artery as well as the left and right carotid
arteries with excellent agreement (inter- and intra-rater correlation both
previously determined to be >0.94).16 The cross-sectional area of these vessels (cm2) and flow
velocity (cm/sec) through them were determined from these regions of interest.
The flow rate (mL/s) for each vessel was calculated from the area and velocity.
Additionally, the total cerebral blood flow was calculated by summing flow rates
for the basilar and carotid arteries and expressed in mL/min. Details on the
assessment of cerebral blood flow can be found in a previous report.16 Outlying values of more than 3.5 standard deviation from the mean were
excluded from the analysis to prevent effects being driven by a few individuals.
Finally, we performed a rank normal transformation of the data to ensure that
the variables are in a normal distribution, since the heritability estimation is
sensitive to deviations from this.

To determine brain volume, T1 images were segmented into supratentorial gray
matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid by using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm.18 White matter lesions were segmented by using the T1 tissue maps and an
automatically detected threshold for the intensity of FLAIR scans.19 Visual inspection of the segmentations led to the exclusion of 197 poor
quality scans, leaving 4472 individuals for analysis.

Heritability analysis
To estimate heritability in our sample of unrelated individuals, we implemented
Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA).20 Briefly, this method compares genetic similarity between individuals with
phenotypic similarity to estimate the amount of variance explained by genetics.
For this, a genetic relationship matrix was calculated as previously described;21 1000 Genomes imputed genotypes were filtered on imputation quality
(R2 < 0.5) and allele frequency (MAF < 0.01) and used to
calculate pairwise genetic relatedness between all individuals. For pairs with
more than 0.02 genotype similarity, one individual was randomly removed.

We estimated the heritability of the area, velocity, and flow for each of the
three vessels, as well as the total cerebral blood flow. All analyses were
adjusted for age, age2, sex, intracranial volume (model 1) and, to take into account any
atrophy, additionally for the total supratentorial brain tissue volume (model
2). To determine patterns of heritability across the age range of our
population, we performed a sliding window analysis. Individuals were ranked on
the basis of their age and the heritability analyses were performed in the
youngest 2000. Next, the study population shifted in 10 equal steps to the
oldest 2000 individuals.

Genome-wide association analysis
Genome-wide association analyses were performed on the cerebral blood flow
parameters for the first model by using the HASE software.22 Variants were removed if they had an R2 < 0.5 and an
MAF < 0.05. Analyses were performed in the three subcohorts of the Rotterdam
Study separately and meta-analyzed with the METAL software.23 Variants with a p-value <5 × 10-8 were
considered genome-wide significant.

Replication
Replication of genome-wide significant variants was performed in the Age,
Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) study, a population-based study in
Reykjavik, Iceland, and which is described in detail elsewhere.24 Briefly, genotyping was performed with the Illumina HumanCNV370 chip and
data were imputed to the same 1000 Genomes reference panel. Cerebral blood flow
was measured in a similar way by using 2D gradient-echo phase contrast sequence
(FOV 220 mm, matrix 25 × 256, TE 6.2 ms, TR 20 ms, flip angle 9°, velocity
encoding 100 cm/s, slice thickness 5 mm). The images were analyzed using the
software package FLOW25 by a single investigator (S.S.), with excellent agreement between
repeated cerebral blood flow measurements in 20 scans (coefficients of variation
1.7).

Results
Study population
The characteristics of the population included in this study are shown in Table 1. The mean age
was 64.8 (standard deviation 10.8) years, ranging from 45.7 to 97.9. The total
brain volume was on average 82% of intracranial volume. The majority of the
cerebral blood flow was provided by the carotids (80%), which was comparable
between left and right. Table 1. Study population characteristics.

Heritability analysis
Table 2 shows the
heritability estimates of cerebral blood flow. The flow through the vessel,
rather than the area or the velocity, was the most heritable parameter. The
highest heritability was for the basilar artery (h2 = 21.8) followed by the
total cerebral blood flow (h2 = 16.1). Additional adjustment for brain volume
slightly increased the heritability estimates. Table 2. Heritability of cerebral blood flow parameters in the Rotterdam
Study.

By using the sliding window approach, we found that the heritability was higher
in the older age groups, most noticeable for the basilar artery parameters
(Figure 1,
Supplementary Table S1). The results were similar after adjustment for total
brain volume (Supplementary Figure 1). Figure 1. Heritability of cerebral blood flow parameters across age. A sliding

cerebral arteries: the basilar artery in red, the left carotid

are adjusted for age, age2, sex, and intracranial volume (model 1). The total population
consisted of 4472 individuals and the sliding window had a size of
2000 individuals (around 1750 after removing related individuals,
see Supplementary Table S1). We passed through the total population
in 10 steps, i.e. moving by an average of 274 individuals in each
step.



Genome-wide association analysis
Next, we performed genome-wide association studies of cerebral blood flow
parameters and identified two significant loci (Figure 2, all variants with
p-values <10−6 are provided in Supplementary
Table S2). These were 6q16.1 for the flow velocity through the right carotid
(rs2971609, p-value = 1.4 × 10−8) and 8q24.23 for
the cross-sectional area of the right carotid (rs12546630,
p-value = 2.0 × 10×8). Both top variants were
intronic (Figure 3),
with 6q16.1 being a known locus for migraine.26 When examining the two loci in relation to all cerebral blood flow
parameters (Table
3), we found that the 6q16.1 locus was associated with a larger area and
a lower velocity in both carotids, while 8q24.23 was associated with larger area
and flow rate of both carotids. The results did not differ materially after
further adjustment for brain volume (Supplementary Table S3). Figure 2. Genome-wide association studies of cerebral blood flow. Manhattan

Replication
We attempted replication of the two significant loci in an independent cohort and
found a borderline significant and concordant signal for 6q16.1 for the flow
velocity through the right carotid (rs2971609,
p-value = 0.057), which is increasing in significance after
meta-analysis (p-value = 2.5 × 10−9). There was no
apparent association for 8q24.23 in the replication cohort
(p-value = 0.83, beta in opposite direction).

Discussion
We find that, in the general population, the total cerebral blood flow is partly
determined by genetic factors, with the highest heritability for the flow through
the basilar artery. The genetic contribution tends to be more prominent at older age
(>65 years). We also identify the first genome-wide significant loci for cerebral
blood flow, one of which showing a similar effect in an independent cohort.

While we are not aware of other heritability studies of cerebral blood flow, the fact
that it is heritable should not be surprising given many reports on the heritability
of brain structure. Most such studies were performed in twins, which produce
systematically higher estimates than the population-based approach we used here.20 Indeed, most heritability estimates of brain traits were considerably higher.
In contrast, the few studies in unrelated individuals that used common genotyped
variants reported substantially lower heritabilities than the twin-based
approach.27–30 Nevertheless, the proportion
of the phenotypic variance explained by genetics is less than half that of height,
which is estimated at 60% following a similar approach to our study.31 Cerebral blood flow might therefore be more susceptible to environmental
factors such a person’s lifestyle, which could in turn influence cardiovascular
health. If some of these consequences are vessel-specific, this may help to explain
the differences between basilar artery and the carotids.

Besides the flow rate, we also examined its two components: the vessel’s
cross-sectional area and the flow velocity. Interestingly, these were both less
heritable than the flow rate. One explanation for this is that flow needs to be
constant to provide the brain with sufficient nutrients, while the area or velocity
may vary as each can compensate the other. Since flow is most crucial for the brain
to function adequately, this might explain why it is under tighter genetic control.
Alternatively, there could be more intra-individual variation in the area and
velocity compared to flow, also resulting in heritability differences between the
parameters.

Another intriguing finding was that flow parameters were generally more heritable
with increasing age. This trend was most apparent for the basilar artery, reaching
heritability estimates over 60% around 70 years of age. Environmental exposures
accumulate over the lifetime while a person’s genetic make-up remains stable. It is
therefore generally thought that the relative contribution of genetics to the
phenotypic variance might decrease over time, but this is not well established in
humans. In a multi-generational cohort, four complex traits were studied but there
was little evidence for differences over time in their heritability.32 For cognitive ability, a gradual increase in the heritability has been
reported from infancy to adulthood,33–36 and it remains high even in
persons over 80 years old.37 The observed increase in the heritability of cerebral blood flow over age
could have several explanations. It is possible that the genetic contribution
remains stable but that environmental factors become less important with increasing
age. For example, the amount and variation in physical exercise might decrease in
the elderly, thereby causing an apparent increase in the heritability. Also, some
genetic factors might exert their effect on cerebral blood flow (more strongly)
later in life, with a notable example of such a gene being APOE.
Additionally, pathology-driven changes in the cerebral vasculature and parenchyma,
e.g. due to Alzheimer’s disease or stroke, might make the cerebral blood flow more
dependent on compensatory mechanisms. Their effects might express only late in life
and in turn the heritability of the response reaction cannot emerge early in
life.

Heritability, which measures the effect of all genetic variants, does not necessarily
imply greater success in gene discovery, where each genetic variant is studied
separately. This is illustrated by the fact that our genome-wide significant
findings were for the area and velocity of the right carotid artery, parameters
which were not significantly heritable. The top variants for the two significant
loci were located in the introns of FHL5 (6q16.1) and
COL22A1 (8q24.23). FHL5, four-and-a-half LIM
domains 5, encodes a transcription factor and was previously identified for migraine,26 and subsequently associated with cervical artery dissection.38 The gene is important for the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells,39 pointing to a vascular mechanism through which it could increase
susceptibility to these diseases. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 375,000
individuals recently revealed that migraine loci are enriched for genes expressed in
vascular and smooth muscle tissues, largely in line with its proposed vascular etiology.40
COL22A1, collagen type XXII alpha 1, is part of the collagen
protein family and variants in this gene have been associated with serum creatinine41 and bronchodilator response in asthma,42 although these specific variants did not associate with cerebral blood flow
in our study. While little is known about the function of COL22A1,
currently unpublished results suggest it is important for maintaining vascular
integrity and mutations cause intracranial aneurysms.43

The strengths of our study include its population-based setting and comprehensive
investigation of cerebral blood flow parameters beyond the conventionally studied
flow rate. Nevertheless, there are several limitations. First, the sample is
relatively small. This is reflected in the standard errors of the heritability
estimates, especially for the sliding window analysis, and this should caution
against overinterpretation of the results. For the association analyses, we
countered the small sample size by performing a replication study in an independent
cohort. While we are unware of other population-based studies that have measured
cerebral blood flow and genetics, larger collaborative studies should be undertaken
once these data become available. Second, our approach for estimating the
heritability in a sample of unrelated individuals by using genotyped variants
represents the narrow sense heritability.20 This means that non-additive effects and the effects of untagged causal
variants will be disregarded, thereby resulting in a potential underestimate. On the
other hand, simple family-based models have recently been shown to inflate
heritability estimates by almost 50% on average compared to estimates obtained from
structural equation modelling.44 Given the methodological considerations for determining which part of the
phenotypic variance is due to genetics, our findings can provide a lower bound of
the true heritability of cerebral blood flow. Third, when additionally adjusting our
analyses for total brain volume, we only used the volume of the supratentorial grey
and white matter. This means that the cerebellum and brainstem, areas that receive
blood from the basilar artery, were unaccounted for. We do not believe that this
significantly influenced our findings since there were only marginal differences
(which generally were improvements) when incorporating brain volume into the models.
Fourth, we used phase-contrast imaging to measure cerebral blood flow, but more
sophisticated methods are available, which also generate regional flow measures.
Functional MRI, arterial spin labeling, and positron emission tomography are
techniques that provide more detailed information on regional blood flow and
perfusion. Furthermore, longitudinal measurements, both across the cardiac cycle
(e.g. the peak systolic velocity) and across the lifespan, could be valuable in
understanding the role of genetics in differences over time in cerebral blood flow.
Finally, our study was included in persons of European descent, making the results
not readily generalizable to other ethnicities.

In conclusion, our study establishes cerebral blood flow as a trait with a complex
genetic basis. Larger studies can elucidate the genes underlying this intricate
process in the brain and perhaps further our understanding of related neurological
diseases.
