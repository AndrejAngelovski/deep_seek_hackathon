Madelung disease, is a rare adult-onset disorder characterized by benign
lipomatosis usually localized to the nuchal and upper thoracic region. A subset
of these patients has germline variants in mitochondrial DNA.
Methods. Three siblings of Northern European descent with
MSL were assessed initially and provided whole blood for DNA analysis. Family
history revealed several additional affected siblings who were dispersed across
Canada. Targeted histories were obtained from 6 additional affected family
members by telephone interviews using a standardized questionnaire, and genomic
DNA was obtained from saliva. Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA was performed.
Genetic analysis. Eight affected individuals who were
studied each had the MTTK gene c.8344A>G variant. None of
the affected individuals had epilepsy, ataxia, or myopathy.
Conclusion. In this extended Canadian family, the rare
MTTK c.8344A>G variant was linked with Madelung disease
in multiple family members. Knowing the likely basis of MSL in this family may
help with diagnosis, genetic counseling, monitoring for associated phenotypes,
and potential future targeted interventions.

==== Body
Introduction
Madelung disease, or multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL; OMIM 151800), is a rare
disorder of adipocyte differentiation that is characterized by benign, diffuse
lipomatosis affecting cephalic, cervical, and upper thoracic subcutaneous
depots.1-5 Although MSL has been primarily
regarded as a cosmetic deformity, associated features sometimes include sensory,
motor and autonomic neuropathy, and myopathy.1-5 Dyslipidemia, insulin
resistance, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and renal and hepatic disease are
relatively uncommon.1 Chronic excessive alcohol use has been linked with accelerated progression of
lipomatosis in some MSL patients.1 A minority of patients have been reported to have large-scale deletions and
specific point mutations within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as well as in some
nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, such as MFN2
encoding mitofusin-2.6,7
In a multigenerational Canadian kindred with at least 8 family members with MSL, we
report the complete co-segregation of the ultrarare mitochondrial gene
MTTK c.8344A>G variant and the phenotype.

Subjects and Methods
The proband and 2 siblings (subjects II-5, II-6, and II-7) were seen together in an
endocrinology outpatient clinic regarding their lipomatosis. Medical histories were
taken, and physical examinations were performed. Blood was collected for clinical
biochemical studies including fasting glucose, lipid profile, insulin and C-peptide,
thyroid, renal and liver function, hematology, coagulation, and for DNA extraction,
as described.8

Six other living family members were identified as expressing MSL; due to
geographical constraints, these individuals could not be directly evaluated in the
clinic. Instead, telephone interviews were conducted for the remaining 6 subjects,
including a targeted medical history via a standardized questionnaire (see Supplementary file; available in the online version of the article).
DNA was obtained from 5 of these 6 affected family members: from blood in 1 subject
(II-4) and from saliva samples from 4 subjects (II-2, II-3, III-3, and III-9), the
latter were obtained using the Oragene DNA kit (OG-500; DNA Genotek, Ottawa,
Ontario, Canada). The Western University Institutional Review Board approved the
project (Reference #07290E), and the participants provided signed informed
consent.

DNA was isolated from the whole blood or saliva from a total of 8 available family
members. Samples from the 3 probands were analyzed for known genes in metabolism and
lipodystrophy using the LipidSeq targeted next-generation sequencing
panel.9,10 Primers for
the MTTK gene were designed and used for both DNA amplification and
Sanger sequencing (primer sequences and conditions available on request). Samples
were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and products were electrophoresed on a
1.5% agarose gel. The purified fragments were sequenced using the chain termination
Sanger sequencing method (ABI 3730 Automated DNA Sequencer, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) at the London Regional Genomics Centre
(www.lrgc.ca) using standard operating procedures and were analyzed
using Sequence Navigator Software (PE-Applied Biosystems, Mississauga, Ontario,
Canada).

Results
Case Summaries
Figure 1 shows the
pedigree structure, including MSL status and electropherogram results. The
family is of Anglo-Saxon ancestry. Figure 2 shows affected regions from
subjects II-5, II-6, and II-7. Tables 1 and 2 summarize clinical and metabolic
features of study participants.

Figure 1. Pedigree structure of Canadian multiple symmetrical lipomatosis
family.

Pedigree showing the proband (II-5, arrow) in relation to 3 generations
of family members. Males and females are squares and circles,
respectively. Black shading indicates clinical affected status for
multiple symmetric lipomatosis. Diagonal lines indicate deceased
individuals. Asterisks indicate individuals who provided medical
information. Ages of subjects who consented to participate are shown.
Sanger sequence electropherogram tracings are shown for individuals who
provided DNA samples for genotyping: the MTTK gene
forward strand at nucleotide positions c.8342-8346 below each individual
who provided a DNA sample. The guanine peak at position c.8344 confirms
the presence of the MTTK c.8344A>G mutation in each
sample. The presence of both guanosine and adenosine peaks confirms
mitochondrial heteroplasmy, indicating more than one type of
mitochondria in these cells. There is no relationship between the
relative peak height and the severity of the clinical presentation (data
not shown). Corresponding mitochondrial DNA sequences from 3 healthy
control individuals, with ages indicated, are shown in the bottom right
corner.

Figure 2. Affected regions of selected family members.

Panels show the affected regions of subjects II-5, II-6, and II-7. There
are both a few apparent discrete lipomas together with other areas of
contiguous increased fat mass. The history in all affected family
members is the same; initially there is appearance of discrete lumps, or
recurrence of discrete lumps after surgical resection, liposuction, or
other cosmetic procedure. With the passage of time, these can evolve in
contiguous regions of increased fat mass.

Patient I-2 was the mother of 6 siblings who were studied. Her medical history
included multiple symmetric lipomatosis, with age of onset at approximately 45
years, myoclonic epilepsy, schizophrenia, and dementia. She died of cancer at
age 65.

Patient II-2 (current age 76) has the mildest clinical presentation of MSL, with
small cervical lipomatous tumors whose onset was noted at approximately 60 years
of age. The majority of the lipomatoses were successfully treated with
dermolipectomy and liposuction at the time of diagnosis and have not grown or
reoccurred since. Other medical history included a myocardial infarction at age
60, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting, prediabetes, hypertension,
gout, colon cancer, basal cell carcinoma, symptoms of muscle weakness, and loss
of sensation in the hands, and significant issues with maintaining balance. His
alcohol consumption was a maximum of 4 to 5 units per week, with no history of
alcohol abuse.

Patient II-3 (current age 75) had medically diagnosed MSL, with cervical and
upper-thoracic lipomatosis first noted around age 40. These included a large 20
cm by 20 cm lipomatous tumor growth in the midscapular region. She had been
treated repeatedly over the past decade with liposuction, dermolipectomy, and
laserderm with varying success, usually with recurrence. Other medical history
included hypertension. She consumed no alcohol and had no history of alcohol
abuse.

Patient II-4 (current age 62) has a medical history of MSL, with cervical
lipomatosis first noted around age 35. She also had hypertension, a history of
thyroid cancer, requiring complete thyroidectomy at the age 29, occasional
muscle weakness, occasional paresthesia in her hands and feet, neural blindness
in one eye, daily migraines with vomiting, and mild to moderate self-reported
memory loss. She consumed no alcohol and had no history of alcohol abuse.

Patient II-5 is the proband (current age 61) and has a history of lipomatosis on
her neck, forehead, shoulders, central back, and abdomen, with approximate age
of onset of 35 years (see Figure 2). Other medical history included dysphagia, sleep apnea,
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, vague numbness and muscle weakness in her hands,
and past history of uterine teratoma, pituitary adenoma, and thyroid cancer. She
consumed no alcohol.

Patient II-6 (current age 58) has a medical history of MSL with significant
cervical and upper thoracic lipomatosis, since about age 40 (see Figure 2). Other medical
history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, and menorrhagia requiring
hysterectomy. She rarely consumed alcohol and had no history of alcohol
abuse.

Patient II-7 (current age 56) had a medical history of MSL with significant
cervical and upper thoracic lipomatosis, since about age 30 (see Figure 2), which were
painful and restricted movement. Other medical history included dysphagia, sleep
apnea, depression, anxiety, bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees, fatigue,
numbness in hands and feet, occasional arm weakness, restless leg syndrome,
dyskinesia, unstable gait, and significant memory loss starting in her late
40’s. She consumed no alcohol and had no history of alcohol abuse.

Patient II-8, female, was born in 1935 and died in infancy of an unspecified
congenital disease.

Patient III-3 (current age 54) had lipomatosis of the neck and upper thorax,
first noted at age 48. Other medical history included hypertension, pes cavus,
almost daily migraine headaches occasionally with vomiting, occasional numbness
and muscle weakness in hands and feet, and significant memory loss starting at
age 49 and noted by her family members. She consumed no alcohol and had no
history of alcohol abuse.

Patient III-5 (current age 51) had cervical lipomatosis first noted at age 45.
Other medical history included migraines and occasional muscle weakness of both
hands. She consumed no alcohol and had no history of alcohol abuse.

Patient III-9 (current age 42) had cervical and interscapular lipomatosis, first
noted around age 25. Other medical history included an asymptomatic congenital
atrial septal defect, thyroid cancer, requiring complete thyroidectomy before
age 30, and constant numbness and loss of sensation in both hands. Her alcohol
consumption was a maximum of 4 to 5 units per month, and she had no history of
alcohol abuse.

Patient III-15 (current age 26) was reported as having early-onset glaucoma. She
had no lipomatosis or neuromuscular symptoms.

DNA Analysis
Sequencing of mtDNA identified heteroplasmy for a single variant,
MTTK c.8344A>G, in each affected family member (see
Figure 1). This
variant is designated in dbSNP as rs118192098 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/), and the reported
frequency of the MTTK c.A8344G allele in Eurasian populations
is 0.0001 (3 occurrences in 29 840 individuals). There were no other putative
pathogenic variants detected in metabolic genes or in nuclear genes involved in
mitochondrial function, specifically in MFN2 encoding mitofusin
2.

Discussion
We report one of the largest multigenerational kindreds with multiple MSL cases, each
of whom carried the ultrarare MTTK c.8344A>G variant. Each
affected family member had a clear history of adult-onset lipomatosis, of varying
severity, together with inconsistent associated features. MSL has an estimated
incidence of 1:25 000, with predominance in some European and Asia-Pacific
populations.1-5 MSL typically presents in the
third to sixth decades of life with the formation of soft lumps around the neck,
shoulders, and upper back.3 Lipomatosis progressively increases in both size and distribution thereafter;
growth rates are variable, often with long, interspersed periods of dormancy.11 The lipomatosis is not painful or tender, although compression of surrounding
tissue may cause pain.1

Most occurrences of Madelung disease are sporadic, with no family history.1 Many patients have a history of alcohol overuse.1 Madelung disease is inconsistently associated with diabetes mellitus,
hyperuricemia, hypothyroidism, liver disease, or peripheral neuropathy. The
differential diagnosis of Madelung disease includes solitary benign lipoma,
encapsulated lipoma, familial multiple lipomatosis, and liposarcoma. Dysphagia and
dyspnea may result from laryngeal or mediastinal involvement.

A 2003 review of 272 MSL cases estimated that 28% of cases were associated with
mitochondrial dysfunction, and of the few cases that were genotyped, 16% had a rare
mitochondrial gene mutation.12 Also, while sporadic MSL is much more common in men, the high proportion of
affected women in the family reported here confirms that there is no male
predilection associated with the MTTK mutation. We note the
relatively milder phenotype of the only affected male in the pedigree (subject
II-2). Furthermore, the maintenance of the MSL phenotype in at least 8 maternally
related relatives spanning 3 generations, in the absence of more severe
neuromuscular features, supports the idea that other interacting genetic or
nongenetic factors compound the tissue and organ-specific impact of the
MTTK c.8344A>G variant.

MTTK codes for mitochondrial tRNA lysine (mt-tRNALys) and the
c.8344A>G variant have classically been associated with myoclonic epilepsy with
ragged red fibers syndrome (OMIM 545000).13 This variant has a frequency of 0.0001 in Eurasian populations. Among
carriers of MTTK c.8344A>G, neuromuscular features are much more
common than MSL.11,13 In the family reported here, there was no history of epilepsy,
ataxia, or myopathy. The most consistently associated features were numbness and
tingling in digits and toes and memory loss in 7/10 and 4/10 affected individuals,
respectively.

Phenotypic heterogeneity between carriers of the same variant may be due to the
following: (1) mitochondrial heteroplasmy; (2) a threshold effect of the mutational
load; (3) interactions with other background genetic factors, including other
unmeasured variants in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA; (4) gene-by-environment
interactions; (5) possible epigenetic effects such as inherited changes in
methylation or histone modification; or (6) unknown variables. Possible epigenetic
control over the severity of the MSL presentation is suggested by altered gene
expression in affected adipocytes.14 While beyond the scope of the present report, ex vivo studies of methylation
of biopsied affected tissue samples from MTTK c.8344A>G carriers
with MSL might be informative.

The standard of care in MSL remains surgical excision, although as noted in affected
family members here, there is a high rate of relapse. Given the strong
co-segregation of c.8344A>G genotype and adult-onset MSL in this family, genetic
counseling could be provided to family members if requested. However, in the absence
of any preventive intervention, providing a pre-symptomatic diagnosis would not
appear to have any immediate clinical value, other than for patient information. If
alcohol abuse is involved, abstinence or reduction of alcohol intake should be
attempted, but this has not been consistently associated with regression or absence
of recurrence of lipomatosis.1

Recent advances in mitochondrial gene therapy and mitochondrial replacement therapy
with in vitro fertilization may be potential future management options. Also,
coenzyme Q10 supplementation may have a benefit, given its role as a mitochondrial
electron transport chain stabilizer. Clinical trials have shown no regression or
stabilization of childhood-onset epilepsy or myopathy in individuals with the
MTTK c.8344A>G variant.15 The effect of coenzyme Q10 is unknown in MSL.

In summary, we report a remarkable family with at least 8 individuals with
MTTK c.8344A>G–associated MSL spanning 3 generations. A
better understanding of the molecular etiologies and clinical features associated
with MSL may be important in identifying specific diagnostic and management
considerations, particularly in patients with mitochondrial mutations such as the
MTTK c.8344A>G variant.
