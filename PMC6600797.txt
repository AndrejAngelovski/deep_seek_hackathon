The number of refugees is the highest ever worldwide. Many have
experienced trauma in home countries or on their escape which has mental
health sequelae. Intrusive memories comprise distressing scenes of trauma
which spring to mind unbidden. Development of novel scalable psychological
interventions is needed urgently.

Aims
We propose that brief cognitive science-driven interventions should
be developed which pinpoint a focal symptom alongside a means to monitor it
using behavioural techniques. The aim of the current study was to assess the
feasibility and acceptability of the methodology required to develop such an
intervention.

Method
In this study we recruited 22 refugees (16–25 years),
predominantly from Syria and residing in Sweden. Participants were asked to
monitor the frequency of intrusive memories of trauma using a daily diary;
rate intrusions and concentration; and complete a 1-session behavioural
intervention involving Tetris game-play via smartphone.

Results
Frequency of intrusive memories was high, and associated with high
levels of distress and impaired concentration. Levels of engagement with
study procedures were highly promising.

Conclusions
The current work opens the way for developing novel cognitive
behavioural approaches for traumatized refugees that are mechanistically
derived, freely available and internationally scalable.

==== Body
Introduction
The global refugee crisis is escalating, as exemplified by events in Syria
(United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
[UNHCR], 2015). Even once in a safe country, refugees are often plagued
by vivid mental images of traumatic events – called ‘intrusive
memories’ – that repeatedly spring to mind unbidden
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Exposure to traumatic events, within Syria or on the escape to Europe, have profound
mental health consequences (Hassan et al.,
2015; Abbott, 2016; Nature Editorial, 2016) that interfere with
acquiring skills needed to integrate into the new environment (e.g. language
learning), for example by disrupting concentration. The UNHCR report on the mental
health of Syrians (Hassan et al., 2015)
highlights culture-specific idioms of distress such as ‘mou adder
rakkezz’ – ‘I can’t focus, I can’t
concentrate’. Intrusive sensory memories occur across several psychiatric
disorders (Bryant et al., 2011), notably in
those disorders with high prevalence in refugees (e.g. Bogic et al., 2012; Hollander et
al., 2016). These include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Grey and Holmes, 2008), depression (Birrer et al., 2007; Williams and Moulds, 2008) prolonged grief (Bryant et al., 2014), and psychosis (Morrison, 2004). Intrusive sensory memories
present a possible ‘transdiagnostic’ target for intervention (Fairburn et al., 2003).

Of the more than a million refugees that reached the European Union in 2015
(UNHCR, 2015), Sweden has taken the
highest numbers per capita with 162,877 asylum applications in 2015 alone (The Swedish Migration Agency [Migrationsverket],
2015). Almost two-thirds of these applications were from individuals aged
13–24 years, and many from unaccompanied minors, constituting 50.3% of all
children between 0 and 17 years who applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015 (The Swedish Migration Agency [Migrationsverket],
2015).

Trauma-associated mental health problems incur heavy costs to individuals and
society: there is urgent need for language-free, simple-to-deliver treatments that
can reach a large and dispersed refugee population (Ullmann et al., 2015). However, innovation is sorely needed as most
psychological treatments cannot reach people with mental illnesses at international
scale (Kazdin and Blase, 2011; Kazdin and Rabbitt, 2013). Refugee host
countries lack capacity to deploy evidence-based psychological treatments at the
scale needed as they typically require face-to-face contact with a therapist/lay
worker (Patel et al., 2011) alongside
interpreters (Ullmann et al., 2015).
Furthermore, the number of psychological treatments tested with refugee populations
is low (Nickerson et al., 2011), raising
questions of cultural acceptability (Hassan et al.,
2015).

Approaches could be: (i) to utilize smartphone technology – which is
appealing and accessible to young people from Syria (87%; Mohr et al., 2014; Central
Intelligence Agency [CIA], 2016) – in a given language, e.g.
Arabic; (ii) to take a mechanistically focused cognitive approach from experimental
psychopathology and target one tractable symptom (rather than a whole syndrome); and
(iii) to focus not only on reducing psychological distress but also downstream
improvements in functioning (e.g. adaption to a host country),
particularly given refugees’ motivation for improvement, demonstrated by
travelling miles through danger and obstacles to reach a better life.

We propose that certain behavioural interventions could be delivered at
minimal cost, directly (without a therapist/interpreter), by smartphone, in
refugees’ daily life. Our vision is galvanized by the recent concept of
‘massive open online interventions’ (MOOIs) (Muñoz et al., 2015). ‘MOOIs have the
potential to increase the reach, scalability, and affordability of psychological
interventions … This term was inspired by the growing popularity of
massive open online courses (MOOCs) …
which attract millions of students …. Digital interventions … can
be used again and again by people anywhere in the world’ (Muñoz et al., 2015).

We have experimentally derived simple-to-deliver methods to reduce the
frequency of intrusive memories of trauma via computer game-play. A one-session
behavioural intervention (involving the game Tetris) at specified time points,
reduces the frequency of intrusive memories of experimental trauma (film footage) by
approximately half (Holmes et al., 2009;
Holmes et al., 2010; James et al., 2015). This suggests a technique
that could be developed after real trauma. Mental disorders and attending mental
health services is associated with stigma in Syrian cultures (Hassan et al., 2015). Young people particularly can be
reluctant to access psychiatric/psychological services, thus computer-gaming in
daily life opens new possibilities to provide support in non-/less-stigmatizing
ways.

This feasibility study with young refugees recently residing in Sweden is a
first step towards future scalable intervention development. We explored monitoring
one target symptom, simple measures of functioning, and the acceptability of a novel
intervention procedure. Participants were asked to (a) monitor the frequency count
of intrusive memories of trauma for one week using a daily intrusion diary; (b) rate
concentration disruption and intrusive memory occurrence over a week; and (c)
complete a one-session intervention involving Tetris gameplay via smartphone. An
important aspect of the research was whether these procedures were feasible without
an interpreter, given that reliance on interpreters would massively increase
treatment costs and impede scalability.

Method
Participants and recruitment procedure
Twenty-two young refugees (mean age 22 years, SD = 2.4; 17 males, 5
females) participated. Sixteen (73%) were from Syria, three from Iraq, and three
not specified. Twenty participants (91%) had Arabic as their first language; the
remaining two (9%) spoke Arabic, but had a different mother tongue. Eighteen
participants (82%) had arrived in Sweden in the last 6 months before study
participation; three individuals arrived 7–12 months earlier, and one
individual arrived more than 12 months earlier. Ten participants (46%) had had
more than 12 years of education, seven participants (32%) had between 10 and 12
years, four participants (18%) had between 6 and 9 years, and one participant
had less than 5 years of education.

Participants were recruited via posters in Swedish, English and Arabic,
advertised digitally through social media (e.g. Facebook pages of Refugees
Welcome and Save the Children) and advertised in paper in relevant institutions
(non-governmental organizations [NGOs], religious institutions, cultural
initiatives, government agencies, and refugee accommodation), and by handing
information sheets to passing individuals at refugee accommodation (with help
from local staff members). Sixteen people were recruited via refugee
accommodation (73%), two via Swedish language classes (9%), two via direct
approach at the central station in Stockholm (9%), one (5%) via Facebook, and
one (5%) via a NGO. Recruitment and interviewing was done in Swedish/English
(orally and on paper) and in Arabic (on paper), without the presence of an
interpreter. Afterwards, the participant’s written responses were
translated from Arabic/Swedish into English.

Participants did not receive any financial compensation. All gave their
written, informed consent before participation; in case of minors consent was
given in agreement with their custodian. The authors assert that all procedures
contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of Regional Ethical
Review Board Stockholm on human experimentation and with the Helsinki
Declaration of 1975, and its most recent revision (ethics approval number
2015/1915-31/5).

Apparatus and materials
Intrusive memory monitoring via daily intrusion diary
The total number (count data) of intrusive memories in the week
after the interview was assessed using a daily pen-and-paper intrusion diary
(Fig. 1A) in everyday life, as in
previous experimental studies (Holmes et
al., 2009; Holmes et al.,
2010; James et al., 2015)
and clinical studies (Iyadurai and Holmes,
2015; Horsch and Holmes,
2016). Participants ticked a box for the day and time period
(morning/afternoon/evening) when the intrusive memory occurred, or marked
‘zero’ if they experienced none. Intrusive memories were
described as: ‘images of traumatic events that pop into your mind
without warning. They often take the form of visual pictures in your
mind’s eye, e.g. like a snapshot image or a film clip. They can also
include other senses such as sounds and smells, such as the smell of smoke.
They may or may not be triggered by something you are aware of, such as
telling someone about what happened, or watching something on the
news.’ Participants were not to record memories recalled deliberately
or general verbal thoughts. Instructions were based on previous protocols
(see Supplemental
Material) and a short definition of flashback/intrusive memories
was printed on the intrusion diary as a reminder. Check marks were summed to
yield daily and weekly frequency counts (Fig.
1B).

After 7 days, participants rated ‘How many of your flashbacks
do you think you recorded in the diary’ from 0 (none of them) to 10
(all of them). Participants were given a stamped addressed envelope to
return the intrusion diary by post.

Ratings of concentration disruption
Participants were asked to estimate, ‘When you have an
intrusive memory how long does it disrupt your concentration on
average?’, on an ordinal scale depicting different time intervals
(<1 min, 1–5 min, 5–10 min, 10–30 min,
30–60 min, >60 min; Fig.
1C).

Two questions rated on 11-point visual analogue scales were:
‘Over the past week, how much difficulty did you have concentrating
generally?’ from 0 (no concentration difficulties) to 10 (extreme
concentration difficulties) (Fig. 1D);
and ‘Over the last week, how much did your intrusive
memories/flashbacks disrupt your concentration?’ from 0 (not at all
disruptive) to 10 (extremely disruptive).

Rating of intrusive memory re-occurrence over the week preceding
interview
Participants were asked ‘How many intrusive memories did you
have in the last week?’ anchored from 0 (none) to 10 (numerous
– all the time) (Fig. 1D).

Computer game-play and intervention procedure
Participants downloaded and installed the computer game Tetris to
their smartphone (e.g. Tetris Free via https://play.google.com/store/apps; version
1.8.03.5593836126994432, developed by EA Mobile Montreal Team). Instructions
for game-play were based on previous protocols (Iyadurai and Holmes, 2015); see Supplemental
Material.

The cognitive task intervention procedure involved two key
components: thinking back to a traumatic event followed by playing the
computer-game Tetris (Iyadurai and Holmes,
2015; James et al., 2015;
Horsch and Holmes, 2016). The
following instructions were used to reactivate trauma memory: ‘We
asked you in the information sheet about any traumatic events that you may
have experienced. You don’t need to tell about this, but to make the
computer game as helpful as possible, we just need to make sure that the
traumatic event is in your mind just before you do the task. So I’d
like you to think back to the traumatic event for a brief moment,
specifically the worst moments that pop back to mind (intrusive memories
that flash to mind). You don’t need to think about it in detail. Let
me help you – did anything pop into your mind? Are there any images
that are flashing to mind or any bits of the traumatic event you can see
again? It’s OK, you don’t have to tell me what happened, as
long as the images were in your mind that’s fine.’ Following
instructions and a practice, participants were asked to play Tetris for at
least one uninterrupted period of 15 min (or longer if they wished) on their
smartphone.

Feasibility and acceptability
Feedback on the feasibility and acceptability of symptom monitoring
and the potential for smartphone-delivered interventions was obtained using
ratings scales as well as open-ended questions. For example, acceptability
of the intervention was assessed by the following 11-point scale: ‘Do
you think computer game play would be an acceptable way to reduce the daily
frequency of the intrusive memories?’ from 0 (not at all acceptable)
to 10 (very acceptable). An example of an open-ended question related to
preference for mode of delivery of the intervention was ‘How would
you feel about talking to a doctor/psychologist about your traumatic
experiences?’

Procedure
All study documents contained both English and Arabic text interspersed
on the same sheets. Communication was done mostly through the translated texts
(the interviewers did not speak Arabic) by handing them in the correct order to
the participants for them to read and fill out.

Participants completed concentration and intrusive memory ratings,
followed by the computer game-play cognitive task procedure. This involved
reactivating a memory of trauma and 15–20 min of Tetris game-play on
their smartphones. Instructions for the daily intrusion diary were given. Next,
feasibility and acceptability feedback questions were collected (see Supplemental Material),
with answers written by the participant in their preferred language. The session
lasted between 60 and 90 min.

Participants were instructed to return their intrusion diary in the post
after 1 week.

Data analysis
Twenty-two participants were tested (Julious, 2005). The study aimed to provide estimates of the mean and
variance of the number of intrusive memories and concentration difficulties
people experience, to inform future studies, but not to conduct tests of
statistical significance. However, given a directional hypothesis, the relation
between the occurrence of intrusive memories and concentration difficulties was
calculated using a Pearson correlation coefficient.

Results
Intrusive memory monitoring via intrusion diary
All 22 participants indicated that they were willing to fill out a daily
intrusion diary to measure the frequency of their intrusive memories of trauma
(7–10 on a scale from 0 to 10). Seventeen participants (77%) then
returned the pen-and-paper intrusion diary by post after 1 week. Of the five
that did not return the diary, one felt too sad to complete the study due to
receiving bad news from Syria about family (as we were informed by his
custodian), and one appeared to not have understood the information properly.
The other three dropped out without providing a reason and did not reply to
mobile phone SMS (short messaging service).

Critically, diary data indicated a mean of almost two intrusive memories
per day (mean = 1.81, SD = 1.39). The mean number of intrusive memories weekly
was 12.65 (SD = 9.71). Of the 17 participants who returned the intrusion diary,
13 (59%) rated 5 or higher on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (all of them) when
asked how many of their intrusive memories they had recorded in their diary
(mean = 6.53; median = 6.00; mode = 6; SD = 2.62; range 2–10).

Ratings of concentration disruption
Eighteen participants (82%) indicated that a single intrusion disrupts
their concentration for longer than a minute on average, a majority (68%)
indicated that it disrupts their concentration for longer than 5 min, while
almost a third (32%) indicated that it disrupts their concentration for longer
than 30 min (Fig. 1C). Difficulties in
concentrating (in general) were experienced by most participants (Table 1), with 41% of the participants
rating 7–10, on a scale from 0 to 10. When asked how disruptive intrusive
memories are for concentration on a scale from 0 to 10, almost one-third of the
participants (27%) indicated 5–7, and over a third of the participants
(36%) indicated 8–10 (Table
1).

Rating of intrusive memory occurrence over the week prior to feasibility
study
On a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (numerous), 21/22 participants rated
that they had experienced intrusive memories of trauma in the past week,
with almost a third of the participants (27%) rating 8–10. Only one
of the 22 participants indicated that they had not experienced any intrusive
memories over the preceding week.

There was a significant positive correlation between the degree to
which participants had experienced intrusive memories over the preceding
week and the degree to which they experienced concentration difficulties
(r = 0.64, n = 22, P
= 0.001; Fig. 1D).

Feasibility and acceptability of smartphone-delivered
interventions
All participants had access to a smartphone and were able to
download the Tetris app. Ratings indicated that it was very easy to download
the app (Table 1). The majority of
participants (59%) reported that they were not familiar with Tetris prior to
the study.

A majority of the participants (77%) rated 5–10 on a scale
from 1 to 10 when asked whether they would find it useful to have fewer
intrusive memories each day (Table
1).

All participants completed at least 15 min of game-play (mean = 18
min; SD = 2.4). Ratings suggested that most participants found Tetris
game-play easy and enjoyable and that it distracted them from having
unpleasant thoughts, images or feelings (Table 1). Furthermore, ratings suggested that they would likely
play Tetris by themselves, in a different environment and that they would
recommend it to a friend (Table
1).

Finally, a majority of the participants believed a computer game
would be an acceptable way to reduce the daily frequency of intrusive
memories (Table 1). Preference for
doctor/psychologist versus technology was equivocal (Table 1). When asked
‘Why?’ replies included: ‘Because I can talk to the
doctor and this will give me the feeling that he will understand my problems
better’; ‘I like computer games, they are fun and make me feel
good and happy. Playing the game makes me forget about my burdens’;
‘It is suitable because we rely on technology in almost everything.
Smart phones are accessible and always nearby’; ‘Because
it’s more easy and the phone now is my best friend to us’.

Discussion
In this study we explored intrusive memories of trauma and concentration in
young refugees predominantly from Syria who recently arrived in Sweden.
Specifically, we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of methodology required
to develop science-driven interventions aimed at reducing the frequency of intrusive
memories of trauma. Levels of engagement with study procedures were highly
promising. Results suggest a high prevalence of intrusive memories and concentration
difficulties in this population and suggest a relationship between these symptoms:
more than half of participants indicated that each intrusive memory disrupted their
concentration for more than 5 min. Furthermore, participants reporting a higher
frequency of intrusive memories also reported more concentration problems in
general. Free report data suggested related functional impairment on tasks
associated with adaptation to the host country such as language learning.

Supporting the development of novel and scalable psychological intervention
procedures (Kazdin and Blase, 2011; Kazdin and Rabbitt, 2013), our data indicate
that young refugees are able and willing to (a) monitor a target symptom –
the frequency count of intrusive memories of trauma for 1 week using a daily
intrusion diary; (b) rate intrusive memories and concentration levels; and (c)
complete one session of computer game-play (Tetris) on their smartphone as part of a
mechanistically driven intervention procedure. These procedures were feasible
without an interpreter, highlighting the potential large-scale application of such
interventions in line with the concept of a future MOOI (Muñoz et al., 2015).

We have argued that psychological treatments can benefit from advances in
neuroscience (Holmes et al., 2014). Candidate
mechanisms to alter trauma memory are offered by understanding the neuroscience of
memory reconsolidation (Nader and Einarsson,
2010), alongside insights from cognitive psychology (Andrade et al., 1997) which capitalize on
special features of intrusive memories – disrupting their mental
imagery-based nature (Grey and Holmes, 2008;
Engelhard et al., 2011; Pearson et al., 2015). Earlier experimental
work shows that the effect of the cognitive-task intervention procedure in reducing
intrusive memory frequency is specific to visuospatial tasks (e.g. Tetris) when
compared with a verbal control game (Holmes et al.,
2010). Further, this method is effective not only for recently viewed
trauma footage, but also for established memories (James et al., 2015). A recent randomized control trial (Iyadurai and Holmes, 2015) has successfully
extended findings to a hospital emergency department setting with patients after a
traumatic road traffic accident. A main advantage of this technological
intervention, as underscored by results from the current study, is the potential for
therapist-free delivery, enabling large-scale dissemination (for example via a MOOI;
Muñoz et al., 2015) and cultural
acceptability to young refugees.

Limitations of this feasibility study include the small sample size and the
sampling procedure, which may have resulted in a less representative sample, and
possibly an underestimation of the scale of the problem (individuals with more
severe psychological problems may be reluctant to volunteer for research studies).
Further limitations include the lack of a control group and a full clinical
interview to assess post-traumatic symptoms. Instead, we took a pragmatic approach,
given the urgency of the topic. Whilst the study is modest, alongside the paucity of
research in this area and the current ‘epidemic’ scale of traumatized
refugees, results offer a small step towards scalable innovation: new ways to (a)
develop and deliver psychological treatments for refugees by focusing on one target
symptom (not a syndrome); (b) deliver research materials in another language; and
(c) bridge a novel behavioural treatment approach for mental health with human
memory theory.

Compliance with the 1-week intrusion measurement was high (78% of
participants returned the diary by post). The 22% drop-out is remarkably low given
that most participants were not familiar with the concept of paper postal services.
Following the impact of war there has been no postal service in Syria for some
years, with smartphone technology almost entirely replacing its use. We included a
photograph of a post-box in the study material to explain the concept of paper diary
return. Future studies harnessing technology for symptom monitoring would probably
improve compliance (Malik et al., 2014). This
is corroborated by the finding that attitudes towards using smartphone technology
for symptom monitoring and intervention delivery were generally positive.

Participants reported, on average, two intrusions a day, which is higher
than the maximum score (‘daily’) on the Clinician-Administered PTSD
Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) (Elhai et al.,
2005). A goal to reduce one intrusion per day could represent a change from
CAPS-5 maximum (‘daily’) to mid-minimum (‘once-or-twice a
week’/‘never’), representing a clinically meaningful outcome
target for future research.

Participants indicated that their intrusive memories typically disrupted
their concentration for several minutes (mode 5–10), suggesting that
intrusive memories were not only distressing, but also impaired functioning by
disrupting focus on daily tasks (see Supplemental Material). Given that persistent intrusive
memories are common after trauma, even in the absence of full clinical criteria for
PTSD, intrusive memory and their associated ‘hotspots’ in the
underlying trauma memory constitute an important target for treatment (Grey et al., 2002). Reducing intrusions holds
promise to prevent the deterioration of mental health, and further
to promote improvements in daily functioning, such as language-learning, key to
integration for refugees entering a new country (Abbott, 2016; Nature Editorial,
2016), and associated with later employment (Daniel and Zurawan, 2010). Behavioural interventions focusing on
a tractable target symptom (here intrusions) may have knock-on effects on other risk
factors, promoting resilience and adaptive functioning. Scalable psychological
treatments have long been needed (Kazdin and Blase,
2011; Kazdin and Rabbitt, 2013)
and the current refugee crisis makes their development an imperative direction for
clinical psychological science.
