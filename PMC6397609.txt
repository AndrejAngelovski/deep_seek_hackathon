 Schizophrenia (SZ) is a mental disorder in which psychotic symptoms are the main problem. The
pathogenesis of SZ is not fully understood, partly because of limitations in current disease models and technology. The
development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has opened up the possibility of elucidating disease
mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we aimed to obtain iPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) of normal and schizophrenic individuals and analyze the inflammatory response in these iPSCs.


Materials and Methods
 In this experimental study, we isolated PBMCs from whole blood of healthy individuals and
SZ patients and reprogrammed them into iPSCs by transfection of recombinant lentiviruses that contained Yamanaka
factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc). We calculated the numbers of iPSC clones and stained them with alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), Nanog, SSEA4, Nestin, Vimentin, and AFP to confirm their efficiency and pluripotency. The iPSCs
were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the expressions of inflammatory
factors.


Results
 iPSCs from schizophrenic patients (SZ-iPSCs) exhibited typical morphology and highly expressed pluripotent
markers. These iPSCs retained their normal karyotype and differentiated in vitro to form embryoid bodies (EBs) that
expressed markers of all 3 germ layers. However, iPSCs from the SZ-iPSCs group had a weak capacity to differentiate
into ectoderm compared to the normal iPSCs (Con-iPSC). An elevated, stronger inflammatory response existed in
iPSCs from schizophrenic individuals.


Conclusion
We successfully obtained iPSCs from PBMCs of schizophrenic patients without genetic operation and analyzed
the expressions of pluripotent markers and inflammatory factors between the Con-iPSC and SZ-iPSC groups. Taken together,
our results may assist to explain the pathogenesis of SZ and develop new strategies for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Introduction
Somatic cell reprogramming into a pluripotent state 
by induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology 
not only paves the way for organ regeneration but also 
provides a powerful tool for studying pathological 
processes (1, 2). In 2006, Takahashi and Yamanaka
(3) were the first to successfully reprogram mouse 
fibroblasts into iPSCs using retroviral vectors to 
introduce 4 genes that encode transcription factors 
(Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). iPSCs, like embryonic 
stem cells (ESCs), can give rise to every other cell type 
in the body, such as neuron, heart, pancreatic, and liver 
cells (4). Therefore, iPSCs technology is considered a 
powerful tool to study the pathological processes of 
diseases and clinical treatment due to its pluripotency
(5). Recently, generation of iPSCs from somatic cells
in disease models has become an important method for
basic research of pathogenesis (6, 7). 

Schizophrenia (SZ), common mental disorder that
usually appears in late adolescence or early adulthood
(8), is mainly defined by psychiatric signs that include 
disorders of delusions, hallucinations, cognition, and 
emotion (9). SZ has a heavy burden for family and 
society because of the risk of suicide, lack of medical 
care, and a higher risk of delusion in schizophrenic 
patients (10). The pathogenesis of SZ is unclear due to 
the limitations of current disease models, technology, 
and clinical approach (11-13). 

Recently, researchers generated iPSCs from human 
fibroblasts of SZ patients and further induced these 
iPSCs to form neuron cells. The iPSCs derived neuron 
cells from SZ patients had lower protein levels of 
PSD95 compared with the neurons from normal 
iPSCs, as well as incomplete neuronal development 
and less junctions (14). Another paper reported that 
neuron cells from iPSCs that had the DISC1 mutation, 
an identified genetic risk factor for SZ, showed 
defective neuronal synapses and abnormal neuronal 
gene expression in contrast to normal neurons (15, 
16). Hence, iPSCs technology has played an important 
role in the study and clinical application of SZ (17, 
18). In this study, we generated iPSCs from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of schizophrenic 
patients and analyzed the morphology, pluripotency, 
and capacity for differentiation, which would provide 
choices for the establishment of an SZ model in vitro. 

Materials and Methods
Isolate and culture of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells
The PBMCs were prepared by density gradient
centrifugation at room temperature using fresh
whole blood both from healthy participants and SZ 
patients. Then cells were cultured in X-VIVOTM 15 
medium (Lonza, Switzerland) supplemented with 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin. Healthy participants and the 
family member/legal guardian of SZ patients provided 
informed consent. This study was approved by the 
Ethics Review Board at Xinxiang Medical University.

Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells
In this experimental study, we generated human 
iPSCs from PBMCs by using retroviruses as described 
previously with some modifications (19). Briefly, 
after the PBMCs were introduced with Oct4, Sox2, 
Klf4 and c-Myc, the cells were transferred into a 3 cm2 
dish covered with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) in 
X-VIVOTM 15 medium. After 2 days, the cells were 
reseeded onto dishes with standard iPSC medium, 
KnockoutTM DMEM, that consisted of 20% knockout 
serum replacement, 1% L-glutamine, 1% nonessential 
amino acids, 0.1 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, 1% penicillin/ 
streptomycin, and 10 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 
2 (bFGF, BD Biosciences, USA). We changed the 
medium every other day until iPSC colonies formed. 
All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere 
that contained 5% CO2 at 37°C. 

Alkaline phosphatase staining
After infection of the PBMCs, we could observe 
the iPSC colonies under a fluorescent microscope. 
To detect alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a 
cytochemical assay was performed using a Leukocyte 
Alkaline Phosphatase Kit (Yeasen, China) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. 

Karyotype analysis
iPSCs were treated for about 45 minutes with Karyo 
MAX Colcemid (Gibco, USA), harvested, and fixed 
with methanol:acetic acid (3:1). The cell pellet was 
washed, resuspended, dropped on a slide, and dried 
on a hotplate. Cells were stained with Giemsa and 
the metaphase chromosome number from individual 
nuclei were counted microscopically (Olympus BX51, 
Japan, 100X), imaged by CytoVision software, and 
subjected for G-band karyotyping at Xinxiang Medical 
University. Karyotypes were described according 
to the International System for Human Cytogenetic 
Nomenclature (ISCN) (19). 

Immunofluorescence staining 
Cells placed on the chamber slides were fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Boster, China) for 15 
minutes at room temperature, washed with PBS, 
and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma, 
USA) in PBS (PBS-T) for 20 minutes. Cells were 
incubated overnight in blocking buffer that contained 
the following primary antibodies: Nanog (1:200; 
Abcam, USA), SSEA4 (1:200; Abcam, USA), Nestin 
(1:200; Proteintech, USA), Vimentin (1:200; Abcam, 
USA), and AFP (1:200; Proteintech, USA) after 
blocking with 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 hour. 
Cells were rinsed and primary antibodies detected 
with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1-2 hours 
at room temperature in the dark. Then nuclei were 
counterstained with DAPI. Images were acquired 
using the Nikon fluorescence microscope and Adobe 
Photoshop (Adobe Systems) software. 

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells with the 
RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and reverse 
transcribed according to the SuperScript III Reverse 
Transcriptase protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) was performed using PrimeSTAR® MAX 
DNA Polymerase (Takara, Japan).

In vitro differentiation
The iPSCs were plated in ultra-low adhered six-well 
plates with DMEM/F12 medium that contained 20% 
KnockoutTM serum replacement, 1% L-glutamine, 1% 
nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, and 
1% penicillin/streptomycin. After 7 days, we transferred 
the resultant embryoid bodies (EB) into six-well plates 
coated with Matrigel (8 EB per well) in differentiation 
medium that consisted of DMEM, 20% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS, Gibco, USA), 1% MEM non-essential amino acid 
solution, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The medium 
was changed every other day. 

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
We performed real-time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with a SYBR® Premix Ex 
TaqTM II Kit and Applied Biosystems 7500. Primers 
for GAPDH, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2 were as 
previously reported (20). Relative transcription levels 
were determined using the 2-ΔΔCT analysis method. 

Results
Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
PBMCs were purified from 7.5 mL of human
whole circulating blood obtained from normal and
SZ individuals by density centrifugation using a 
Ficoll gradient. This centrifugation separated the 
lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasma (Fig .1A). The 
PBMC layers were carefully transferred to a new tube 
and washed twice with 1X PBS. After centrifugation, 
the cells were resuspended in the appropriate volume 
of culture medium. Further, flow cytometry analysis 
showed that isolated PBMCs were mainly a subset of 
CD45+ or CD14+ monocyte cells (Fig .1B). The human 
PBMCs were then recovered with a final centrifugation
and stored at -80oC. 

Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells
Lentiviral vectors played a major role in the historical 
development of iPSC technology due to their ability to 
efficiently transduce murine cells for lasting expression 
of transgenes. The isolated PBMCs were transduced with 
a lentiviral plasmid that encoded OSKM factors (Fig .2A) 
and mCherry fluorescent protein at day 4. The OSKM 
factors in these PBMCs could be activated after they 
were infected by the virus. The cells were subsequently 
transferred to Matrigel and cultured with KnockoutTM 
DMEM medium. The iPSC-like colonies started to form 
2 weeks later from the infected PBMCs that grew on the 
Matrigel (Fig .2B). We picked the colonies that displayed 
a typical morphology of iPSCs and mCherry protein 
expression from normal people and SZ patients (Fig .2C).

ALP enzymatic activity represents ESC pluripotency. 
We performed ALP staining and the results showed that 
the iPSC clones were ALP positive in both normal and 
SZ individuals (Fig .2C). These data showed that we could 
successfully establish iPSC clones with fewer transformed 
cells from the PBMCs in SZ patients.

Characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells 
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
We sought to assess whether the PBMCs from SZ 
patients could be reprogrammed into iPSCs. We 
selected the clones and re-plated them into six-well 
plates coated with Matrigel. We analyzed expressions 
of the pluripotency markers (Nanog, Oct4, Rex1, 
Sox2) in iPSCs and PBMCs by RT-PCR (Fig .3A). 
Karyotyping analysis showed that the iPSCs from 
SZ patients had normal karyotypes according to the 
standard G-banding technique (Fig .3B). We detected 
activity of pluripotency markers by immunostaining
and observed relatively high expression levels of 
Nanog and SSEA4 in the generated iPSCs (Fig .3C). 
In addition, we analyzed the numbers of iPSC clones
per cm2 and fluorescent cells in immunofluorescence
staining (Fig .3D). There was no significant difference 
in iPSCs formed between normal people and SZ
patients. These results indicated that the generated
iPSCs from PBMCs displayed pluripotency as well as 
ESCs and other iPSCs.

To further determine the pluripotency of iPSCs, we 
cultured undifferentiated EBs (Fig .4A) with differential
medium and then determined the differentiation
potential of iPSCs by RT-PCR. The results showed 
both differentiated iPSCs from normal people (ConiPSCs) 
and SZ patients (SZ-iPSCs) expressed 
ectoderm (Pax6, Nestin), mesoderm (Kdrl, a-cardiac 
actin) and endoderm (Afp, Gata4) markers (Fig .4B). In 
addition, we performed in vitro differentiation assays 
and found that the iPSCs had the ability to differentiate 
into 3 germ layer-derived cell types. The assay used 
Nestin as a marker for ectoderm differentiation, 
Vimentin to mark mesoderm differentiation, and 
alpha fetoprotein (AFP) for endoderm differentiation 
(Fig .4C). However, a study of the fluorescent positive 
cells of Nestin, AFP, and Vimentin staining showed 
that the iPSCs had a weak capacity to differentiate
into ectoderm and strong ability to differentiate into
endoderm and mesoderm in SZ patients compared to 
normal people (Fig .4D). Taken together, the PMBCs 
of normal people and SZ patients had a similar ability 
to generate iPSCs. Nevertheless, it seemed that the 
iPSCs from SZ patients might have some defect for
differentiating into ectoderm cells compared to those 
from normal people.

Expression of inflammatory factors in induced
pluripotent stem cells of normal individuals and 
schizophrenia patients 
There is ample evidence that inflammation/immune 
system can influence and shape the development of the 
CNS and behavior. The importance of this information as 
a factor in the etiology of SZ has been strongly emphasized 
by different laboratories that have investigated the effects 
of inflammation (21, 22). We detected the expression of 
inflammatory factors in iPSCs derived from normal and 
SZ patients when compared by qRT-PCR analysis. The 
results showed that the expression levels of Il1b, Il6, 
Il8, and CCL2 in iPSCs from the SZ-iPSC group were 
much higher than the Con-iPSC group (Fig .5). This assay 
showed that the inflammation/immune system might play 
an important role in the etiology of SZ disorders.

Discussion
The appearance of human ESCs was believed to be
beneficial in cell therapy and other medical applications
(23). iPSCs, because of their similar characteristics to 
ESCs, became a novel alternative in stem cell biology. 
After the discovery of iPSCs, numerous scientists 
have established iPSCs from various somatic cell 
types, especially fibroblasts. Unlike fibroblasts, 
which are difficult to obtain, peripheral blood cells
can be easily procured without the need for surgery
(24). The biggest difference between fibroblasts and 
PBMCs is that the PBMCs first need to transform into 
an attached form during reprogramming. In our study, 
we have used Matrigel to help the floating cells attach 
and improve adherence and reprogramming. Then, 
the settled cells could expand into reprogrammed 
iPSCs. The pluripotency of the PBMC-derived iPSCs
generated by our study could be used in therapeutic 
cell research and disease modeling.

SZ is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that 
results from genetic and environmental factors. The 
pathogenesis of SZ is not fully understood, in part 
due to the limitations of current disease models and 
technology. In recent years, numerous researchers 
have focused on the establishment of an SZ disease 
model. The emergence of iPSC technology provides a 
new strategy to study SZ. Our study has demonstrated 
that PBMCs in SZ patients can be successfully 
reprogrammed into iPSCs without feeder layer 
cells, which are indispensable for reprogramming 
of fibroblasts. We can study the pathology and the 
mechanism of action of SZ using the SZ-iPSCs model 
in vitro.

Inflammatory factors play an important role ininfection and inflammation and are crucial mediators 
of the cross-talk between the brain and the immune 
system. SZ may be associated with an imbalance ininflammatory cytokines. Degradation products of 
inflammatory substances have been described in 
schizophrenic brain tissue (25). In terms of the cytokinepattern in SZ, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin(IL)-2, soluble IL-2 receptors, IL-6, and IL-10 havebeen frequently observed in unmedicated SZ patients(26). However, expression of the inflammatory factorsof iPSCs from SZ patients remains unclear. Our 
findings from iPSC technology provide evidence of 
the establishment of an inflammatory syndrome in SZ.

Conclusion
We successfully derived iPSCs from PBMCs of 
schizophrenic patients and showed that schizophrenic 
patients had a higher, stronger inflammatory response in 
iPSCs. Our results might lead to the development of develop 
new strategies for clinical diagnosis and treatment of SZ.
