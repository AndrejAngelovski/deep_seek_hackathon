suicidality. However, no studies have explored autistic peoples’ experiences of
treatment and support for these difficulties. In partnership with a steering
group of autistic adults, an online survey was developed to explore these
individuals’ experiences of treatment and support for mental health problems,
self-injury and suicidality for the first time. A total of 200 autistic adults
(122 females, 77 males and 1 unreported) aged 18–67 (mean = 38.9 years, standard
deviation = 11.5), without co-occurring intellectual disability, completed the
online survey. Thematic analysis of open-ended questions resulted in an
overarching theme that individually tailored treatment and support was both
beneficial and desirable, which consisted of three underlying themes: (1)
difficulties in accessing treatment and support; (2) lack of understanding and
knowledge of autistic people with co-occurring mental health difficulties and
(3) appropriate treatment and support, or lack of, impacted autistic people’s
well-being and likelihood of seeing suicide as their future. Findings
demonstrate an urgent need for autism treatment pathways in mental health
services.

==== Body
Introduction
Adults diagnosed with autism spectrum conditions, (ASC, also commonly referred to as
autism spectrum disorder (ASD)), are at high risk of co-occurring mental health
conditions (Lever and Geurts,
2016; Wigham et al.,
2017), non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI; Maddox et al., 2017), and suicidality
(Cassidy et al.,
2014a, 2018a; Hedley
and Uljarević, 2018; Hirvikoski et al., 2016). However, mental health, self-injury and
suicidality in autism are poorly understood and under-researched (Cassidy and Rodgers, 2017),
with a shortage of professionals trained in both autism and mental health (Raja, 2014), lack of
appropriate assessment tools (Cassidy et al., 2018b, 2018c) and therapies (Ghaziuddin et al., 2002) for this group.
Given that autistic adults without intellectual disability (ID) are at highest risk
of contemplating suicide (66%, Cassidy et al., 2014a), and dying by suicide (Hirvikoski et al., 2016), the current study
focuses on autistic adults without co-occurring ID (henceforth autistic adults1).

Lack of support for autistic adults has been associated with increased risk of
depression and suicidality (Cassidy et al., 2018a; Hedley et al., 2017). Autistic adults also
report a significantly higher number of unmet support needs than the general
population (Cassidy et al.,
2018a); autistic adults and children struggle to obtain appropriate
support post diagnosis (Crane et
al., 2016; Jones et
al., 2014); and autistic young adults (16–25 years) face challenges in
accessing appropriate treatment for mental health problems (Crane et al., 2018). Hence, despite
autistic people being at significantly increased risk of mental health problems and
suicidality than the general population, they appear to be less likely to be able to
access support and treatment for these difficulties.

Reasons for this lack of treatment and support are likely complex. First, mental
health professionals and psychiatrists are generally not trained in recognising and
understanding ASC, meaning services are unprepared to adapt support and treatment to
this group (Raja, 2014).
Second, there are a lack of appropriate validated assessments to effectively
identify mental health problems such as depression (Cassidy et al., 2018b) and suicidality in
autistic adults (Cassidy et al.,
2018c; Hedley et al.,
2018). Third, there is a lack of appropriate adapted psychological
therapies for autistic people (Ghaziuddin et al., 2002). These challenges are likely greater for
autistic adults without ID (commonly referred to as Asperger Syndrome in ICD-10, but
subsumed into ‘autism spectrum disorder’ in Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.;DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association (APA),
2013)), who compared to other autism subtypes experience greater delay in
diagnosis (Howlin and Asgharian,
1999) and accessing treatment (Bowker et al., 2011), increased risk of
being initially misdiagnosed with a mental health problem (Au-Yeung et al. in press; Dossetor, 2007; Punshon et al., 2009) and
lack of post-diagnostic support (Howlin, 2008; Jones
et al., 2014). Therefore, autistic adults without ID are likely
encountering professionals without the necessary skills or tools to effectively
assess, support or treat autistic adults experiencing these difficulties.

Little is known about autistic adults’ experiences of receiving treatment and support
for mental health problems, self-injury and suicidality, with a majority of studies
being quantitative. Autistic people feel their voices have been excluded from
research (Milton and Bracher,
2013), so a participatory approach is advocated in research (Fletcher-Watson et al.,
2018; Pellicano et
al., 2014). Hence, this study explored autistic adults’ experiences of
treatment and support for mental health problems, self-injury and suicidality from
their own perspective, using a participatory approach – autistic adults helped
define the aims, design and questions used in the research. We explore barriers and
enablers for autistic adults when accessing support and treatment, to make
recommendations for future research, policy and practice to improve access to mental
health services for autistic adults without ID.

Given the lack of previous research, we use an exploratory qualitative approach, with
broad research question, to capture sufficient breadth and depth of participants’
experiences (Braun and Clarke,
2013). Open-ended questions in qualitative surveys allow access to a
larger sample than other qualitative methods (Robson, 1993). These benefits are magnified
when the research question is sensitive, as online surveys provide privacy and
anonymity, extending the potential reach further (Braun et al., 2013). Open-ended online
questions also allow an investigation into participants’ understanding of their own
experiences without researcher, or other participants, involvement that may bias
their responses (Robson,
1993). When similar experiences are reported, it provides compelling
evidence for a shared understanding of the issues being explored. As many autistic
people have communication and social interaction difficulties (APA, 2013), they may
find interviews or focus groups challenging or uncomfortable. Hence, the use of an
online survey allows a wider range of autistic people to participate.

Method
Participants
A total of 200 autistic adults were included in the qualitative analysis (122
females, 77 males and 1 unreported), aged 18–67 (M = 38.9 years, SD = 11.5). The
age of autism diagnosis ranged from 2 to 59 years (M = 34.1 years, SD = 13.8). A
majority (90.4%) of participants had a mental health diagnosis, most prevalent
being depression and anxiety. The most prevalent autism subtype was Asperger
syndrome (Table 1).
In relation to treatment for mental health, self-injury and suicidality (n =
197), 164 participants (83.2%) were currently receiving/had previously received
treatment, 29 participants (14.7%) needed/currently needed treatment but had not
received it and 4 participants (2%) did not need treatment (Table 2). In relation
to support, (n = 198) 164 participants (82.8%) reported that they would like to
have support or currently receive support. Of those who reported they would like
to receive support and answered the question on types of support received (n =
159), 76 participants (47.8%) currently received none (Table 3).

Participants’ data were drawn from the mental health in autism survey, a large
online survey developed with the Coventry Autism Steering Group, which explored
mental health problems, suicidality and thoughts of ending life in autistic
adults. Participants were recruited to this survey from the United Kingdom
through the Cambridge Autism Research Database (CARD), charities and support
groups, educational institutions and social media.

Materials
A survey exploring mental health, self-injury and suicidality in autistic adults
was developed in partnership with an autistic steering group across six focus
groups, facilitated by researchers. S.C., L.B. and R.S. Full details of the
dataset and survey questions are available in a previously published study
(Cassidy et al.,
2018a). The steering group consisted of eight autistic adults without
ID (six female, two male), who consented to share their experiences of mental
health problems, self-injury or suicidality to inform future research and
practice. The researchers designed a questionnaire to capture the discussion of
these experiences. The steering group fed back on three drafts of the survey to
ensure questions were comprehensive, relevant and clear to autistic people.

Data from the survey concerning experiences of support and treatment are
presented here. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire, exploring
experiences of treatment and support using closed and open-ended questions.
Closed questions asked whether participants had ever needed or received
treatment or support, what they currently/previously needed treatment for
(mental health problems, self-injury, thoughts of ending life or other), the
areas which they currently/have received support in and the areas they would
ideally like support. Subsequently, open questions asked: ‘Please describe your
experience of trying to get treatment for your condition(s). (For
example, what has your experience been like, and how could it be improved?
Are there any barriers preventing your access to treatment?)’ and
‘If you wish, please provide more details of your experiences of support.
(For example, do you currently get the support you need? Does
anything make it difficult to get the support you need? Is any support you
are currently receiving/have received appropriate for your needs? Could
anything be improved? If so, how could it be improved?).’

If participants indicated that they would like support, but do not currently
receive any, they were asked: ‘If you wish, please describe how has this
affected you?’. If participants indicated that they currently/have received
support, they were asked: (1) ‘What have been the positive consequences of this
support (if any)?’ and (2) ‘What have been the negative consequences of this
support (if any)?’.

Ethics
All elements of the survey were designed to minimise potential distress.
Participants were given full details about the nature of the research and
contact details of relevant support organisations before, during and after the
survey. It was made clear to participants that no questions were compulsory. The
ethical approach was discussed with the steering group to ensure it was
acceptable to autistic people. This study was granted ethical approval by the
Coventry University Psychology Ethics Board, and the CARD Advisory board, prior
to contacting participants registered in CARD.

Data analysis
Thematic analysis was used to analyse data from the open-ended survey questions
(Braun and Clarke,
2006). Analysis was carried out by L.C.-C., who was not involved in
the steering group discussions facilitated by S.C., L.B. and R.S., to avoid
unnecessary bias. However, as thematic analysis is an active process, the
researchers acknowledge that their own experiences and preconceptions as
non-autistic people naturally influenced the themes to an extent. L.C.-C.
undertook the thematic analysis from an essentialist theoretical position with
experiences understood as the participant’s reality. Analysis was data driven
and carried out inductively, themes were derived from the data, as opposed to
from a pre-existing theoretical framework or previous research (Potter and Wetherell,
1987). L.C.-C. discussed themes with S.C. and L.B., who offered
feedback and helped refine themes to ensure interpretation of the data was
valid.

Results
The overarching theme on which this article focuses was that tailored treatment and
support is both beneficial and desirable. This theme was dominant throughout
participants’ experiences, for example, ‘it has become very apparent that approaches
to treatment have to be tailored to patients with an ASC’ (78F)2. Underneath this overarching theme, sat three themes: ‘people like me don’t
get support’, ‘lack of understanding and knowledge’ and ‘well-being’ (Table 4).

sub-themes.

Treatment and support was not distinguished in the analysis because participants used
them interchangeably. Frequency count of themes and sub-themes are reported, not as
a measure of prevalence, but given the large sample of responses to help gauge the
extent of shared experience (Braun and Clarke, 2013).

‘People like me don’t get support’
This theme explores participants’ experiences of difficulty finding appropriate
treatment and support, as autistic adults with mental health difficulties:I haven’t requested any, because people like me don’t get support. Any time I
have enquired about such things that has been made very clear. At this point
I don’t even know who I might request help from. (654M)



For many participants, this lack of treatment or support was explicitly linked to
their co-occurring autism and mental health diagnoses (16 participants), which made
them ‘too complicated’ (36F), and ineligible for services: ‘if you have [ASD] then
mental health say it’s not their problem’ (157M); and ‘unless you have a co-morbid
learning disability3, you’re on [your] own’ (237F).

For some then, the experience of being autistic and having co-occurring mental health
issues seemed one of falling through a gap in available services (37
participants).

Dismissed for treatment or support because viewed as ‘coping’
This theme refers to ‘coping’ in the broadest sense, rather than ‘with’ a
particular singular thing. Participants described how their need for support was
dismissed due to non-autistic people’s (mis)perceptions of ‘high-functioning’
ASC (26 participants). Specifically, autistic people were viewed as ‘coping’
(474F), ‘functioning’ (56F) or ‘managing’ (28F) even when they were not because
they were too ‘high-functioning’, independent, in employment or at University,
which resulted in them being excluded from relevant treatment and support:I am high-functioning and an adult … I feel ‘lost’…. I am too high
functioning for most ASD programming in my area, but not neurotypical
enough to function well in conventional work and social situations and
environments. (650F)



However, being in employment, for example, did not necessarily mean that the
person was coping and did not need support or treatment:I think some of the issues with understanding is that some people don’t
think you can be really struggling if you are managing to go to work/uni
etc. Of course in hindsight with the Asperger’s diagnosis that is just
partly because dropping the routine would be even worse. I was also
conscious that I was safer not in the house. (235F)



Support geared towards autistic children
Participants identified that support is tailored towards children and their
parents (nine participants):[support] in past – good especially at autism specific college. i rarely
needed to explain autism or myself … now not good at all – life is hard
and people seem to fighting [against] me who should be there to help.
(153F)



Long waiting lists and lack of funding
Participants identified long waiting lists and lack of funding (from the National
Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom; 37 participants) as reasons for
there being no treatment or support available to them, even if actively suicidal
(9 participants):I tried to kill myself and I was really f***ed up and needed counselling.
The NHS waiting list was nine months. You [can’t] wait nine months when
you’re suicidal … I only got through that period by abusing drugs.
(272F)



Many participants gained access to the treatment and support they needed by
paying for it themselves, while those who could not afford to went without (37 participants):if I had not been able to borrow the money to see one privately, I would
still be living a nightmare full of untreated anxiety and self-hatred
because I thought it was my fault I was different … (11F)



Participants also cited a lack of available treatment in their local area (12
participants), due to their refusal ‘to fund anything’ (744F). Location acted as
a barrier for those ‘unable to access treatment that involves travel as I lack
energy and cannot use buses’ (131F), or more generally because they simply
‘can’t get there and back again’ (192F).

Lack of understanding and knowledge
Experiences of professionals’ ‘very poor knowledge of autism’ (181F) played a key
role in many negative experiences (89 participants):The biggest difficulty in getting the support I need is the lack of
understanding of autism. Even after decades of research, many institutions
still don’t have the first clue in dealing with such a condition, and hence
I have found only select places deal with autism specifically. The support I
have received I feel isn’t suitable enough. No ordinary counselor can
understand autism, and the social aspects provided by a support worker
haven’t helped me to end my feelings of rejection … If there was someone who
both understood the condition and me, I feel progress would be made.
(750M)



Many participants felt a need for professionals to be better trained in autism to
‘realise it may not always be possible to accurately read a person with autism’
(120F). Participants felt that this up-skilling of autism knowledge was not their
responsibility: ‘some of them have asked to borrow books from me about autism or
asked me to teach them about it and I feel that shouldn’t be down to me’ (181F).
These experiences suggest that professionals were often ‘well-meaning’ (176M) but
lacked knowledge of the different way in which autistic people communicate and
socially interact, and the implications for their treatment and support.

The following sub-themes will continue to address how professionals lack of
understanding of mental health in autism acted as a barrier to accessing appropriate
treatment and support.

Obstacles to accessing and receiving treatment and support
The road to obtaining treatment and support for many autistic people was littered
with obstacles, from the initial self-acknowledgement that treatment and support
was needed, to the point of receiving it (34 participants):I recognise that I often don’t realise just how bad things have become.
In the last year I have started thinking about suicide, even though I
don’t want to die, and that has been the thing that’s made me realise
how bad things might be. (375F)



Subsequently, the process of asking for treatment and support lacked transparency
and felt daunting and complex: ‘I don’t know how or what I would say or how I
would explain or then what would happen’ (298F). Asking for support in itself
required a specific skill set: ‘how does someone who need support self-advocate
for support because that’s what they ask for’ (47M), and for some, the
challenges outweighed the potential benefits: ‘I have not requested it – I find
it very difficult seeking help’ (165M).

After successfully obtaining treatment or support, communication difficulties
mounted once face to face with a professional:I felt like I was having a breakdown inside but I didn’t know how to make
the inside feelings show to other people. (375F)



Communication difficulties were exacerbated further when ‘in crisis’ and in an
unfamiliar and noisy environment such as a hospital:I can’t always communicate if I’m in crisis. Ward rounds in the hospital
would always be awfully stressful for me, having to talk in front of a
room of people. So are meetings with my Psychiatrist. I feel comfortable
with my care coordinator now and she’s learnt to do things like ask me
direct questions rather than open ones, but not everyone is so
accommodating. (133F)



Not believed or listened to
When seeking professional help for mental health problems, many participants felt
their symptoms were discarded (29 participants):With hindsight a massive barrier was that I just don’t show emotion the
way other people do so aside from when I was very anorexic no one
believed there was anything wrong with me or that I needed help. There
are specific things depressed people are supposed to do, but I don’t do
them. (18F)



Other participants described being ‘not believe[d] … and told … to go away’
(66F). These experiences unsurprisingly led to ‘loss of trust’ (734M) towards
professionals and services for some (19 participants). However, not all
experiences were negative. For example, one participant used contrasting
experiences to demonstrate the power of being listened to and not being pre-judged:I have had my share of ineffectual medications and therapies, including
ignorant psychiatrists and counsellors who made things worse rather than
better because they seemed to decide what the problem was and what was
best without actually listening to me. However, I have also had some
very good counsellors and GPs who have listened, been good at talking to
me in a way I can engage with, and worked with me rather than simply
talking at me. (435M)



Not suited to my needs
Continuity of care was highly valued (12 participants): ‘going back to the same
person was good because it takes me ages to form a good rapport’ (158F).
Appointments, however, were not long or frequent enough to ‘make yourself well’
(47M) and tainted by worries of them coming to an end (eight participants):NHS counselling is good for people who can immediately connect to another
person. If you have autism it takes time, and by the time you are
starting to make some kind of connection you have run out of sessions.
(120F)

I guess I’m quite dependent upon the support now, and when I am better
enough to be discharged from mental health services where I receive most
of my support, I will feel very ‘alone’. (133F)



Lack of understanding of autism also played out in experiences of treatment and
support that were not necessarily fit for purpose (38 participants), such as
receiving cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for mental health problems.
Experiences were not homogeneous. Some participants argued CBT was an effective
treatment (eight participants):CBT was more effective than I had thought it would be. It explained my
thought processes and why I behaved the way I did. (136F)



However, many argued it was not (22 participants), particularly if it was not
adapted to their needs:I had communication issues with each therapist because they expected me
to be neurotypical, so I would take things too literally and they
thought it was a defense mechanism, or I’d try to explain meltdowns and
they focused on my thoughts rather than how to deal with over-reactive
sensory perception. (4F)



Well-being
Although the survey questions were phrased to explore treatment and support in
relation to mental health, self-injury and suicidality, interestingly participants’
responses frequently referenced their overall well-being. This theme explores those
experiences of treatment and support, which when negative adversely impacted the
participant’s well-being, while in contrast when positive enhanced their
well-being.

Negative Impacts
Experiences of perceived inappropriate support made participants feel worse about
themselves and their (dis)abilities, to the extent that it was actually
disempowering (14 participants):Having a mencap support worker when I am not learning disabled has
actually made me feel worse. I feel like I’m falling into a pit of
incapacity. (4F)



For other participants, the absence of appropriate treatment and support was at
the root of the negative impact on their lives (51 participants):I used to have a lot of support and since the cuts have really struggled
– I’m forgetting meds, have lost lots of skills and confidence and am
stuck indoors now all the time, I am ill but my mum is old now so can’t
take me to gps and when we go they do not listen as they dont understand
me … support workers used to help me do all the times I just ticked but
I lost them – now I get sore and infections because I forget to wash and
struggle to find energy, I used to volunteer and also do courses – now I
do nothing- im alone almost all the time … I’ve got to the point where I
wonder what the point of me being here is – I dont contribute anything …
I have no life and no purpose … (734M)



In the absence of appropriate treatment and support, many participants were
reliant on informal support from family and friends (19 participants). Feeling
conflicted about this support was not unusual. Participants often felt entirely
dependent on this support, as external support was inadequate in addressing
their needs, but wanted to become more independent and felt ‘guilty’ (7F).
Participants wrote of the burden they felt on family and friends: ‘I would like
to feel that I was worth some support instead of what I feel at the moment which
is that I’m a useless scrounging burden on the people I care about’ (32F), some
wrote of not reaching out for help in case they were seen as a burden:I don’t have many people to turn to when I feel low, so most of the time,
I just toss and turn with waking nightmares and don’t tell anyone,
because I don’t want to wear out the goodwill of the friends I’ve got.
(118F)



Participants also wrote of the toll that supporting them was having on their
family and friends, for example, the ‘completely unpaid’ friend who was
‘seriously damaging their health’ (75F). Another participant wrote,The support doesn’t really meet my needs and so my mother has to do more
for me and her health hasn’t been too good really. so sometimes I try to
suffer in silence so that I do not let her in my flat so [that] she
cannot see what a mess I am in. and that I haven’t food in to eat.
(700M)



Participants also felt excluded from society and the local community: ‘I miss out
on my vibrant town’s many events because I can’t cope with the noise and crowds
on my own’ (131F). Another wrote of participating ‘in the world through an
ever-smaller keyhole’ (172F) in reference to activities she no longer felt able
to complete, such as going to the shops. Another participant’s life was ‘very
limited’ and she was not ‘fulfilling’ her ‘potential’ in that she wanted to
‘contribute to the community’ but did not ‘really know how’ (587F). Other
participants experienced exclusion from society in the wider sense. For example,
‘for people with an ASC it is likely that they will be rejected by society
because we don’t fit in … The idea of what normal … is shrinking [and] more and
more people are being excluded from society’ (34F).

Absent or inappropriate support caused participants to feel hopeless, isolated
and alone (eight participants): ‘I am stuck struggling on my own and feeling
very hopeless that my situation will ever change for the better’ (32F); and ‘I
have great difficulty avoiding hopelessness and depression and do not know when
to reach out for help’ (149F). In relation to isolation, participants wrote of
feeling ‘alone with my problems’ (197M) and feeling ‘desperate and isolated
because I don’t receive any support’ (375F).

Thoughts of ending life were a reality for some participants, who described
suicide as an inevitability (four participants):My sense is that support of any kind just won’t change anything in a
practical way. In some ways I feel I’m using the therapy as palliative
care until I have enough energy and commitment to actually die.
(646M)



Positive and enabling
In stark contrast, many participants’ experience of receiving treatment and
support was positive and directly improved aspects of their mental health and
well-being (63 participants). Participants wrote of overcoming a range of
specific mental health problems (10 participants), from ‘phobias and anxieties’
(54F) to ‘I now have my OCD under control, I am totally cured of anorexia’
(152F). For some, treatment was successful in reducing or managing self-injury
(three participants), such as the participant who ‘did 10 weeks of group DBT,
was 18 months cutting free, the longest since I started’ (235F), and the
participant who wrote, ‘I feel more confident and hurt myself less’ (74M).

In terms of thoughts of ending life, participants wrote frankly of the literal
way that treatment and support was the reason ‘I am still alive’ (1F) and that
‘I would not be alive without it … as I’m quite sure I would have eventually
succeeded in suicide without the help I’ve received over the years’ (435M). For
other participants, suicide was no longer viewed as part of their future (seven participants):The support I receive is very relevant … Due to my condition, I was in a
position where I thought the idea of killing myself was better than
carrying on. I see now that I had never learned how to ask for help. I’d
spent my life camouflaging and thought I had to be able to do it all
myself. I still find receiving the help a challenge but wholeheartedly
know that it has been life-saving in the true sense of the word. I was
at a rock-bottom with my self-esteem and sense of value. I am grateful
for this relevant support as it is helping me through life-changes that
I certainly could not do alone. I have faith that I can learn to value
myself for who I am and maybe find a way of living peacefully.
(178F)



Another outcome of positive experiences of treatment and support was of feeling
‘better able to function in your world’ (661M). With support, life had become
‘manageable’ (181F) and ‘help[ed] me cope better with life’ (143F). For some,
these experiences made a ‘totally life changing difference to my life’ (620F).
These experiences included an array of different capabilities, including
relationships and everyday social interactions (15 participants):I have been able to reduce the time that I spend feeling depressed and
have been able to get into a healthy relationship. (582F)



In contrast to the aforementioned experiences of social isolation and exclusion
from the community, participants wrote of how support had opened up their access
(two participants):To allow me to access the community when I was ill with mental health and
therefore couldn’t go out alone and also attend activities and events
that the people behind these events didn’t believe I could attend
myself. (35F)



Participants also wrote of how not feeling alone (10 participants) made them feel
‘safe’ (28F) and provided them with ‘emotional reassurance’ (7F). One woman
wrote of how the support alleviated pressure and ‘gives her the chance to step
outside having to be the good mother and the good daughter and the good wife and
just be me’ (175F). Participants wrote of better understanding themselves (nine
participants) with improved ‘confidence’ (432M), ‘self-awareness’ (54F) and the
ability to value themselves more: ‘my treatment has given me more compassion for
myself as a human being’ (432M). Participants also described how support opened
up employment and education prospects (11 participants): ‘when people understood
my support needs it enabled me to survive, to work and to have good mental
health’ (47M).

In stark contrast to the negative experiences described previously, these
positive experiences reported a connection to others, acceptance, independence,
autonomy and self-understanding (to name a few) and of suicide no longer being
an option.

Discussion
This study is the first to explore autistic adults’ experiences of treatment and
support for mental health problems and suicidality. Previous research has shown that
autistic adults are at high risk of experiencing mental health problems (Lever and Geurts, 2016),
NSSI (Maddox et al.,
2017), suicidality (Cassidy et al., 2014a) and unmet support needs (Cassidy et al., 2018a). Yet there is a lack
of research, validated assessments and treatment approaches for mental health and
suicidality in autistic adults (Cassidy and Rodgers, 2017) and knowledge of autism and mental health
among professionals (Raja,
2014). This study thus aimed to identify barriers and enablers for
autistic adults attempting to access support and treatment for these difficulties,
to inform future research, policy and service planning for this group.

Participants in this study described being excluded from mental health services for a
number of reasons. First, participants described a gap in available mental health
services for autistic adults without co-occurring ID. Second, assumptions were made
about autistic people being ‘high-functioning’ and perceived as coping when in fact
they were struggling. Third, long waiting lists and lack of funding for support or
treatment were described, even for autistic people experiencing suicidality. These
results are consistent with previous research and clinical reports of lack of autism
expertise in mental health and psychiatric settings (Raja, 2014) and no autism mental health
pathway (Crane et al.,
2018). A recent study on autism language-use from the perspective of the
UK autism community, found the term ‘high-functioning’ can underestimate the
problems an autistic person can face on a daily basis (Kenny et al., 2016). Bowker et al. (2011) also found that people
with Asperger’s syndrome were less likely to receive treatment compared to other
subtypes of autism, perhaps due to their less obvious symptoms or generally higher
cognitive and intellectual abilities. This is particularly worrying given that up to
66% of adults newly diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome have experienced suicidal
ideation (Cassidy et al.,
2014a), 72% of autistic adults score above the psychiatric cut off for
suicide risk (Cassidy et al.,
2018a) and autistic people without co-occurring ID are at the highest
risk of dying by suicide than the general population (Hirvikoski et al., 2016).

Participants also described a lack of professionals’ understanding of autism, which
contributed to barriers in accessing appropriate treatment and support. For example,
many autistic people experience alexythymia – difficulty identifying and describing
one’s own emotions (Bird et al.,
2010), difficulties with social and communication skills (APA, 2013), and
report ‘camouflaging’ their symptoms in order to fit in social situations (Hull et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2017; Rynkiewicz et al., 2016).
Participants described how these difficulties led to challenges in recognising they
needed help and successfully requesting help. In addition, autistic people not only
have difficulty interpreting the behaviour of neurotypical adults (Cassidy et al., 2015; Cassidy et al., 2014b) but
neurotypical adults may also have difficulty interpreting autistic peoples’
behaviour (Sheppard et al.,
2016). This ‘double empathy problem’ could result in misunderstandings
between autistic and non-autistic people (Milton, 2012). This may explain why
participants described needing time to develop a rapport with their therapist, and
of being misunderstood and feeling disregarded by professionals. Subsequently,
participants described difficulty in coping with change (a key part of diagnostic
criteria for autism, APA (2013), which meant they preferred consistent and long-term
support and treatment. Hence, the participants in this study described how
difficulties characteristic of autism, impacted their ability to recognise they need
help, effectively request help, and benefit from help when it was finally acquired.
Participants did not feel that it was their responsibility to provide training or
educate professionals within services they came into contact with. Rather,
professionals need autism training and appropriate tools to adapt to autistic
peoples’ needs to enable them to effectively access and benefit from services.

Participants also described how their experiences of treatment and support impacted
their well-being, of which mental health forms a key part (Burgess and Gutstein, 2007). Specifically,
absence of, or inappropriate support or treatment not suited to their needs, was
associated with feelings of disempowerment, perceived burdensomeness on family and
friends, social exclusion and isolation, hopelessness and seeing suicide as an
inevitability. In contrast, many participants described how appropriate tailored
support and treatment empowered them, gave them autonomy, facilitated their
inclusion in social networks and wider society and gave them hope for a future where
suicide was no longer an option. Little is currently known about well-being in
autism (Robeyns, 2016),
but autonomy and a sense of belonging could be particularly important (Milton and Sims, 2016),
similar to the general population (Pelton and Cassidy, 2017; Van Orden et al., 2010).
Results from this study are consistent with these findings, and suggest that
appropriate support could improve autistic adults’ well-being, of which autonomy and
belonging are a crucial part.

Results have strong implications for services (such as the National Health Service
(NHS) in the United Kingdom, referenced by many participants in this study). The
majority of participants reported needing support with mental health, mentoring and
social activities, but under half actually received this support. A previous study
from this dataset showed that these unmet support needs significantly predicted
increased risk of suicidality, after controlling for a number of known risk markers,
such as employment and mental health problems (Cassidy et al., 2018a). Results from this
study are consistent with these results and provide greater detail regarding
enablers for autistic accessing services. Specifically, there needs to be greater
availability of appropriate services for autistic peoples’ diverse needs, so these
individuals do not ‘slip through the net’. Specific enablers identified include
clinicians being both knowledgeable about mental health in autism and flexible in
order to make reasonable adaptations to meet autistic peoples’ needs (Ghaziuddin et al., 2002).
For example, autistic people may need support with emotional literacy prior to
psychological therapies if they have difficulties identifying and describing their
emotions. Given difficulties with communication, flexible thinking and adapting
behaviour in many autistic people, psychological therapy is effective but takes
longer and thus requires a higher number of sessions (Anderberg et al. 2017). Participants in this
study described that it took much longer to establish a rapport with their therapist
or support worker, but there were too few sessions, which caused much anxiety when
they came to an end.

This study has a number of strengths. A key strength was the participatory approach
used in the research, which ensured questions were important, relevant and clear to
autistic people. The online recruitment method meant we were able to capture a large
sample, and wide range and depth of experiences compared to interviews or focus
groups, which are also less accessible to autistic people. However, respondents to
the survey were autistic adults who were able to respond independently to an online
survey, and therefore results are not generalisable to those with co-occurring
intellectual disability. A majority of the sample comprised autistic women, opposite
to the gender bias in the wider autistic population. A majority of participants had
also experienced mental health treatment and may have responded to the survey as
they felt it was important, and many therefore not be representative of those who
did not respond. Diagnoses were all self-reported, however, previous research has
shown good agreement between self- and clinician report (Daniels et al., 2011). The exploratory
qualitative approach meant that it is not possible to draw conclusions on prevalence
of these experiences in autism. However, given the openness of the questions, and
the common themes among participants identified, gives strong evidence for shared
experiences. Given the size of the dataset, it was only possible to display a
snapshot of the main themes. The mean age of autism diagnosis was very broad
(ranging from 2 to 59 years) and this study did not consider whether delayed
diagnosis impacted the experiences of treatment and support. The lack of distinction
between treatment and support in this study, owing to participants using the terms
interchangeably, may have reduced the ability to make specific targeted
improvements. Future quantitative research is needed to explore what types of
adapted support and treatment could improve mental health outcomes and prevent
suicide in autism, and whether the elements of well-being identified in the current
and previous qualitative studies could inform a new measure of autistic
well-being.

In summary, although participants reported experiences of being excluded from mental
health services, with potentially tragic consequences for their well-being, there
are also examples of participants benefitting from tailored support and treatment,
which had a positive effect on their well-being. Given the potentially tragic
consequences of failing to support autistic people and treat mental health problems
and suicidality in this group, it is crucial that services are trained in autism and
prepared to adapt to their needs. The participants’ experiences show that this is
not only possible, but highly beneficial.

1. We have opted to use identity first language throughout the article, as this
is the most highly endorsed preference by the autistic community (Kenny et al.,
2016). However, we acknowledge that a wide range of language is used
to describe autism and many autistic people who took part in the study used
person first language.

2. Random numbers in square brackets are used to distinguish participants
anonymously, with ‘F’ denoting female and ‘M’ male participants. For
example, (1F) refers to participant 1, female. Where more than one
participant has endorsed a theme or phrase, frequency counts are given, for
example (11 participants).

3. In this study, ‘learning disability’ used by participants predominantly in
the United Kingdom is synonymous with ‘intellectual disability’ in the
United States, meaning an intelligence quotient below 70.
