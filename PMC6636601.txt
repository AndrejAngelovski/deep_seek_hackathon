schizophrenia in particular was noticed in the mid-1950s. In subsequent years,
the role of Toxoplasma gondii was established based on its
ability to survive for long periods of time in the nerve cells of the brain. The
acute manifestations of the infection include psychopathic symptoms resembling
those of schizophrenia. In the former USSR, and in other parts of the world, a
number of studies were performed with respect to the association of latent
toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia. However, with the dissolution of the USSR at
the beginning of the 1990s, studies on the subject were halted due to financial
problems and have resumed only recently. The reasons for the resumption of such
studies in contemporary Russia are related to the progressively increasing
incidence of schizophrenia over the last 25–30 years in the country. According
to official data, approximately 550 000 persons reported suffering from the
disease in 2014. There are reasons to believe that this is only a fraction of
the real burden of the disease. Economically, it cost the state no less than
approximately US $10 billion. The purpose of the study was to identify the level
of toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in patients with verified diagnoses of
schizophrenia in comparison to healthy people in Moscow City and in the Moscow
region. A total of 155 persons constituted the patients group and 152 healthy
people were in the control group. An integrated approach to the diagnosis and
comparison of data from the entire spectrum of serological markers of infection
was used, including the detection of specific IgM and the determination of IgG
concentrations. It was found that among persons with neuropsychiatric disorders,
the incidence of cases with latent toxoplasmosis was higher than in the control
group. The effect of toxoplasmosis was significant and similar for men and
women. Further statistical analyses revealed that among patients with a
diagnosis of schizophrenia, the incidence of latent toxoplasmosis was
significantly higher than in the control group. These data are in agreement with
the results of similar studies in other countries.

==== Body
Introduction
The causative agent of toxoplasmosis–Toxoplasma gondii Nicolle et
Manceux–was discovered in 1909. The definitive hosts of T.
gondii are different species of Felidae. T.
gondii is one of the world’s most pervasive parasites,
infecting a wide range of mammals, including humans, that act as intermediate hosts
[1, 2]. Toxoplasma is an
intracellular parasite and can affect different cells of mammals. These protozoa are
neurotropic agents [3, 4].

Two types of toxoplasmosis in humans are known: the congenital form, the result of
prenatal infection from a recently infected mother, and postnatal acquired
toxoplasmosis. Postnatal acquired toxoplasmosis has two forms–the transient acute
toxoplasmosis, which is characterized by numerous specific and non-specific
symptoms, and life-long latent toxoplasmosis, which is asymptomatic from the
clinical point of view in immunocompetent subjects. The first results from infection
during the prenatal period of life, and the second is contracted during the
postnatal period. Rarely, certain symptoms of acute toxoplasmosis persist for months
and even years as so-called chronic toxoplasmosis [5].

Chronic or latent forms are more prevalent in humans than acute forms. Toxoplasmosis
constitutes a serious health problem that is responsible for a prolonged disease
course with polymorphic clinical manifestations, particularly with respect to the
brain (mental disorders), eyes, heart muscles and other organs [6, 7]. The prevalence of latent toxoplasmosis
varies widely in different countries of the world, reaching approximately 90% in
certain areas. The seroprevalence of infection is 25%-30%, on average, in Western
and Eastern Europe. In the United States, an overall seroprevalence varied between
11% and 22.5% [8]. The
prevalence of latent toxoplasmosis in the territory of the former USSR (until
dissolution in 1991) was in the range of 10%-15%.

The results of a recent study on latent toxoplasmosis among residents of Moscow City
and the Moscow region revealed that seroprevalence was 25.3% [9].

The last 15–20 years have seen a sharp increase in publications from different parts
of the world on the association of latent toxoplasmosis and mental disorders [10–12]. The reason for such interest is the
ability of Toxoplasma gondii to survive for long periods of time in
the nerve cells of the brain. Acute toxoplasmosis sometimes leads to symptoms
similar to those of schizophrenia, namely delusions and hallucinations [12]. Cases are known from
patients with a well-verified diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis and a primary
diagnosis of schizophrenia [13–15].

The increase in production of the neurotransmitter dopamine and the hormone
testosterone, as well as other Toxoplasma-associated changes,
affects the psychomotor performance, personality profile, and behavior of infected
subjects [16].

Schizophrenia is one of the most prevalent mental diseases. Positive and negative
symptoms of this disease, as well as its effects on cognitive performance and
behavior, have dramatic social and economic consequences [17].

The disease is characterized by a latent course with frequent remissions
necessitating prolonged hospitalization, marked by increasing personality changes
and feelings of invalidation. It is usually accompanied by other diseases and
results in a reduction in lifespan [18].

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are approximately 24 million
persons in the world afflicted by the disease. The highest incidence of the disease
was found in Sweden (1.7%), Ireland (1.2%), Russia (0.82%), and the USA (0.72%)
[19].

In the former USSR, a number of studies were performed with respect to the
association of latent toxoplasmosis and mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia
[20, 21]. No similar research was
carried out following the dissolution of the USSR. However, the necessity to resume
such studies is warranted due to the acute prevalence of schizophrenia in
contemporary Russia. According to official data, approximately 550 000 persons
reported suffering from schizophrenia in Russia in 2014 [22]. There are reasons to believe that these
figures are only a fraction of the real burden of disease. More than 60% of mental
health cases occur in individuals with disabilities, and the unemployment rate among
them is at least 10-times higher than among healthy people.

As a result, the economics of the country suffer considerably from the disease
burden. It costs the state alone no less than Rouble 547 billion (approximately US
$10 billion as of 31 December 2017) annually [23].

The purpose of our study was two-fold. First, we aimed to identify the level of
toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in a group of patients with verified schizophrenia
diagnoses in comparison to a group of healthy people. Second, through the analysis
of published data from the former USSR on the relationship between mental disorders
and latent toxoplasmosis, we identified the prevalence during the 1960s-1990s and
compared it with the present status in the Russian Federation.

Materials and methods
The study was performed at the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University during
2016. To establish the general prevalence of latent toxoplasmosis among residents of
Moscow city, examinations were carried out on patients attending the Outpatient
Department at the Clinical Center of the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical
University. No special criteria were selected for examination in terms of age, sex
or occupation. To address the second objective, we carried out an analytical
epidemiological “case-control” study represented by two groups: patients and
control. The patients group consisted of psychiatric patients with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia. All members of the patients group were patients of the Psychiatry
Clinic of Sechenov University. The criteria for inclusion were as follows: a)
neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosis (schizophrenia); and b) aged 18–45 years. The
criterion for exclusion was infectious pathologies (hepatitis, AIDS). All
individuals in the control group were evaluated for the presence of a psychiatric
disorder by means of a very thoroughly collected anamnesis. A total of 155 patients
constituted the patients group, with 75 men and 80 women (Table 1). The control group consisted of 152
healthy persons aged 18–45 years (82 men and 70 women) who were undergoing routine
medical examinations at the Clinical Centre of Sechenov University. Participants in
the patients and controls groups were informed about the purposes of the study, and
informed consent was obtained before enrollment in the study.

Blood samples were taken from all participants of this study under sterile
conditions. The samples were centrifuged at 200 g, and the sera were stored at -20°C
until serological examination. All study patients were tested for the presence of
IgG- and IgM-specific antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. The
determination of specific immunoglobulin G and M in the blood serum of the study
population was performed using “Vector Toxo-IgG” (Cat. No. D-1752, Lot. No. 263) and
“Vector Toxo-IgM” (Cat. No. D-1760, Lot. No. 151) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) test kits (Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation). The concentration
of IgG to Toxoplasma gondii in the test samples was measured in the
test samples was measured in international units of IU/ml using calibration
graphs.

Serological analysis
The diagnosis of latent toxoplasmosis was based on the results of serological
tests, namely on the presence and concentration of specific IgM and IgG
antibodies.

A sample was considered negative if the T.
gondii IgG level was under 10 IU/ml, and values above 10
IU/ml were considered positive. Evaluation of the results of the enzyme
immunoassay for the determination of IgM antibodies was carried out by
calculating the coefficient of positivity. The subjects with positive IgG and a
negative IgM test were considered latent toxoplasmosis-positive.

The statistical significance of the results in the patients and control groups
was obtained using the χ2 test, and the odds ratio (OR at 95%
confidence interval [24].
The Statistical Package EpiInfo was employed for calculations. Additionally, we
used the Pearson correlation, partial correlation, and Mantel-Haenszel common
odds ratio estimate.

Ethical considerations
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Health of the Sechenov
First Moscow State Medical University (protocol No. 04–13, 10.04.2013).
Participants in the patients and control groups were informed about the purpose
of the study, and verbal informed consent was obtained before enrollment in the
study.

Results
The results of the examination of blood serum in the patients and control groups are
presented in Table 1.

No IgM-positive subjects were observed in our populations of patients and controls.
In contrast, specific anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies were detected
in 40% of those tested in the patients and in 25% of the control group. The absence
of immunoglobulin IgM in conjunction with the presence of IgG suggests the presence
of an exclusively latent form of toxoplasmosis in both the patients and control
groups. The number of seropositive subjects with IgG in the patients was
significantly higher than in the control group. Thus, among the patients with
neuropsychiatric disorders, the incidence of cases with latent toxoplasmosis was
more than twice than that in the control group.

The data in Table 1 show that
the effect of toxoplasmosis was significant and similar for men (OR = 1.72,
CI95 = 0.88±3.37, p<0.11) and women (OR = 2.19, CI95 =
1.08±4.43, p<0.03). A similar seropositive prevalence was found in men and women,
in both in the patients and control groups, despite the fact that the prevalence of
toxoplasmosis was approximately twice as high in the patients group. To assess the
possible confounding effects of sex, we also performed the Mantel-Haenszel test. The
OR adjusted for sex was 1.93, CI95 = 1.18±3.15.

Discussion
The relationship between latent toxoplasmosis and mental disorders was well
documented by Soviet researchers during the 1960s-1980s. The results of selected
studies during the period of 1960–1970 are given in Table 2. The data relate to studies conducted in
the territories of 2 Republics of the former USSR–Ukraine and the Russian
Federation. All data were obtained through the use of Complement Fixation Test,
only. Among various mental disorders, schizophrenia constituted between 50% and 89%
[25].

The data illustrated well established trend of the association between toxoplasmosis
and schizophrenia in study areas of the USSR and it was in agreement with the
results obtained in other countries abroad. It was shown that the seroprevalence of
toxoplasmosis among patients with mental disorders was 2–3 times more frequent than
among healthy persons [33,
34]. In Germany, the
prevalence of toxoplasmosis in conjunction with various mental disorders was 43%-50%
compared to 3% among healthy persons; in Poland, the prevalence was 51% compared to
25%; and in Czechoslovakia, the prevalence was 43% compared to 10%, respectively
[33].

The results of our own studies demonstrate a considerable increase in toxoplasmosis
prevalence both in the patients (40%) and, particularly, in the group of healthy
individuals (25%) compared with the results from studies during the 1960s-1970s
(Table 1).

Hypothetically, it could be interpreted as an expansion of toxoplasmosis among the
population of the Russian Federation in parallel with the increase in mental
disorders, particularly schizophrenia, during the following years. This hypothesis
is supported by the official data from the period 1965–1987, when the number of
mental outpatient cases, particularly schizophrenia cases, increased by 4.7-times
[33].

A similar trend was observed during the following years after the dissolution of the
USSR [35–38].

The results of our own studies are compatible with the data derived from similar
studies in Germany (39% of schizophrenia patients were seropositive for
toxoplasmosis) [39]. Similar
data from other countries revealed that the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in
schizophrenia patients varied from year to year and from place to place [40–43].

Meta-analysis of the results of 38 studies in different countries of the world
revealed that aggregate OR was 2.73 [12], while it was considerably lower in our study at 1.93. This might be
due to the vast proximity of the territory of the Russian Federation and the wide
variation in the socioeconomic conditions of local people, resulting in a broad
range of toxoplasmosis prevalence. For example, toxoplasmosis prevalence in the
Tatarstan Republic at present is 31% [35], while it is 5%-9% in the Republic of Saha
(northeast Siberia) [35] and
approximately 10% in Omsk city (southern Siberia) [37].

The association between toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia and toxoplasmosis was found
by hundreds of studies. However, the direct role of toxoplasmosis in etiology of
schizophrenia is still sometimes questioned. In fact, until now, only one
longitudinal study has examined the causality relation between toxoplasmosis and
schizophrenia. Based on the criterion of temporality, it confirmed that the
Toxoplasma infection is the cause, rather than the effect of
schizophrenia [44].

Forty years ago, some researchers still believed that the high prevalence of
toxoplasmosis among schizophrenia patients was related to poor sanitation and
hygiene together with frequent contact with sources of infection [45]. The neurophysiological,
pharmacological, genomic and epidemiological evidence accumulated during the past 30
years, however, proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the
Toxoplasma infection is the cause, not the consequence of
schizophrenia.

The probable role of Toxoplasma strains with different virulence in
the etiology of mental diseases was studied in the USSR during the 1970s [46]. It was shown that virulent
strains of Toxoplasma produce hyaluronidase, which facilitates the
penetration of the parasite into host cells along with exotoxins with lethal and
derma-necrotic properties; nonvirulent strains lack this enzyme. Furthermore, it was
concluded that the lack of this enzyme is a biological characteristic of nonvirulent
strains, facilitating their survival in the cyst form in the host for an extensive
period of time.

A recently revised hypothesis on the important role of virulent strains of
Toxoplasma gondii in the etiology of schizophrenia has received
new attention. This hypothesis is based on the results of published data showing
that virulent strains of Toxoplasma gondii are more frequently
associated with the increased prevalence and severity of the clinical course of
toxoplasmosis [47]. Moreover,
evidence exists that certain drugs used for the treatment of schizophrenia inhibit
replication of T. gondii [48].

The hypothesis takes also into account several factors probably contributing to the
etiology of schizophrenia [14, 15, 49–53]. Importantly, hypothesis also considers
that T.gondii might not be involved directly in
the etiology of schizophrenia, but could interact with other genetic and/or
environmental factors. Such possibility is well-tuned to Konovalov’s (1972)
interpretation of the role of toxoplasmosis in mixed infections. It was demonstrated
that in mixed infections involving toxoplasmosis, comembers of the parasitic system
may possess both antagonistic and symbiotic characteristics, by which the severity
of pathologic toxoplasmosis is determined. Activated toxoplasmosis infection
aggravates other coinfections and diseases such as malignant tumors, tuberculosis,
schizophrenia, etc.

It could also be beneficial to understand the degree of receptivity of the population
towards contraction of infection. For example, the iso-antigens of the blood system
ABO(H) could serve as markers of the latter. The results of the study in the Far
East region of the Russian Federation indicated that women, carriers of iso-antigen
A, and men, with iso-antigen AB, were more receptive to infection. Those carriers of
iso-antigen B were relatively resistant to infection. The native population of
Chukotka (Chukchi, Eskimos) is also less receptive [54].

Strengths and limitations of the study
The strength of the study is seen in the provision the
Toxoplasma seroprevalence data for underexplored
region–Russian Federation. The limitation of the study is a relatively low
number of participants and, in the absence of clinical and demographic data in
respect of participants. The results of our studies might contribute to a better
understanding of the reasons for the increasing incidence of schizophrenia in
the Russian Federation. The association of latent toxoplasmosis and
schizophrenia could be seen as one of the probable factors responsible for the
disease. However, this study is limited in terms of the generalizability of the
findings, as it examined the residents of Moscow City and the Moscow Region
only.

Conclusions
The results of our research are in agreement with the data obtained by Soviet
scientists and their colleagues abroad during the 1960s-1980s with respect to trends
of higher levels of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in patients
with mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia, in comparison with healthy
persons.

Our results are also compatible with the results of studies on the subject obtained
in various parts of the world during the last 15–20 years. However, there is an
appreciable difference (approximately 30%) regarding the OR index. It was 1.93 in
our case as opposed to a cumulative OR of 2.73 in studies elsewhere. The reasons for
this difference need further study.

Our publication should be considered as a resumption of studies carried out during
the 1960s-1980s in the former USSR with respect to the association of latent
toxoplasmosis and mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia. This is an important
area of research in consideration of the heavy burden of disease in the Russian
Federation.
