with a complex clinical presentation. The last two decades have seen a
proliferation of literature on the neurobiological mechanisms subserving
affective processing in posttraumatic stress disorder. The current review will
summarize the neuroimaging results of the most common experimental designs used
to elucidate the affective signature of posttraumatic stress disorder. From this
summary, we will provide a heuristic to organize the various paradigms discussed
and report neural patterns of activations using this heuristic as a framework.
Next, we will compare these results to the traditional functional neurocircuitry
model of posttraumatic stress disorder and discuss biological and analytic
variables which may account for the heterogeneity within this literature. We
hope that this approach may elucidate the role of experimental parameters in
influencing neuroimaging findings.

==== Body
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition which
develops due to the impediment of recovery after the experience of a traumatic
event. Currently, PTSD is viewed as having a complex and heterogeneous clinical
presentation, spanning four symptom clusters: (1) intrusive memories, distressing
dreams, or flashbacks; (2) persistent avoidance of trauma reminders; (3) negative
changes in thoughts and mood; and (4) heightened arousal reactivity.1 Although the experience of a traumatic event throughout the lifetime is
unfortunately common,2,3
only a minority of individuals will go on to develop PTSD. It is estimated that 6.8%
of individuals in the general population will meet criteria for PTSD;4 however, this rate substantially increases in populations with greater trauma exposure.5 For example, a study conducted by the Congressional Budget Office6 found that 21% of individuals from overseas contingencies operations (OCO) in
Iraq and Afghanistan met criteria for PTSD. Furthermore, the Veterans Health
Administration’s average cost of treating OCO veterans with a PTSD diagnosis was
approximately four to six times greater than those not carrying the same diagnosis.6 Despite the prevalence and substantial burden, the neurobiology and
concomitant neuropharmacological treatments for PTSD are not well understood. As
such, there is an increasing need to identify the neural pathogenesis of this
disorder.

One approach in understanding the neurobiology of PTSD has been through functional
neuroimaging techniques. Indeed, the last two decades have seen a rapid growth in
the utilization of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission
tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the
neurobiological inquiry of PTSD. Commonly, these functional techniques employ
paradigms designed to elicit re-experiencing symptoms,7 which were historically viewed as the defining feature of PTSD.8,9 Also known as “symptom
provocation” paradigms, these studies focused on affective processes and aimed to
elicit neural activity in response to trauma-related reminders, such as idiographic
traumatic scripts, images, and sounds. In addition to findings from non-human animal
studies, the results of symptom provocation paradigms put forth a prevailing and
elegant functional neurocircuitry model (FNM) of PTSD first proposed by Rauch et al.7 The FNM views PTSD symptomology through the lens of a fear-conditioning
framework. Specifically, it was contended that the amygdala is hyperactivated in
individuals with PTSD, contributing to heightened processing of fearful and
threatening stimuli. Next, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), including the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), subcallosal cortex, and medial frontal gyrus, are
found to be hypoactive in individuals with PTSD, resulting in inappropriate
persistent fear of trauma and non-trauma-related stimuli. Finally, the hippocampus
is proposed to functional abnormally in individuals with PTSD, leading to difficulty
with adaptive fear learning and extinction.10

Although the FNM has reigned predominate as the most referenced neurobiological model
of PTSD, several other salient models should be noted. The triple network model
proposes aberrant neuronal functioning of the central executive, salience, and
default mode networks, which may lead to symptoms of multiple psychopathologies.11 When applied to the neurobiology underscoring the clinical manifestation of
PTSD, Patel et al.12 contend that deficits in the central executive network, specifically that of
the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and lateral areas of the parietal lobe, are
underutilized in individuals with PTSD, whereas the precuneus is reliably over
recruited. In contrast to these findings, Patel et al.’s assert that the salience
network exhibits greater activation in individuals with PTSD, specifically in the
anterior insula and dorsal ACC. Finally, the default mode network, specifically the
mPFC, posterior cingulate cortex, posterior inferior parietal lobule, and left
parahippocampal gyrus were less activated in individuals with PTSD. Although
findings from their meta-analysis largely support the triple network model, the
authors note that there were inconsistent findings with respect to the
directionality of activation due to selection of comparison group, as well as
reliable clusters of neural activation which were found outside of the anatomical
demarcation of the central executive, salience, and default mode networks.12 Another compelling neurobiological model of PTSD is that of the dissociative
subtype, first put forth by Bremner et al.13 In their neurobiological review of this model, Lanius et al.14 found that individuals with PTSD with chronic dissociation—as characterized
by states of detachment, depersonalization, derealization, and subjective distance
from their emotional experiences—contain unique neurobiological features, which can
be distinguished from the non-dissociative sub-type of PTSD. Specifically, the
dissociative subtype of PTSD was found to have a unique neural manifestation, as
indicated by the overmodulation of midline prefrontal, dACC, and limbic regions of
the brain.14

The traditional FNM has served as a crucial first step in understanding the
neurobiology sub-serving anomalous affective processing in PTSD. However, the
results of recent symptom provocation studies are inconsistent, thus suggesting that
FNM may underrepresent the neurobiological complexity of PTSD. For example, Sartory et al.15 conducted a meta-analysis of 19 symptom provocation studies in individuals
with PTSD. Their results provided partial support for the traditional neurocircuitry
model, such that when comparing trauma-related stimuli to the control condition
(e.g., neutral script), individuals with PTSD exhibited significantly greater
activation in the bilateral amygdala, mid-line pregenual and retrosplenial cortices,
as well as the occipital and angular gyri. However, support for the FNM of PTSD was
not found when Satory et al.15 compared patterns of activation to trauma-related stimuli between individuals
with PTSD and a trauma exposed control group (TEC). Instead, this between-subject
contrast revealed that individuals with PTSD demonstrated greater activation of the
mid-line retrosplenial cortex and precuneus in response to trauma-related stimuli.
In a similar meta-analysis of 12 symptom provocation studies, Hayes et al.16 found that when comparing trauma-related stimuli to a neutral condition,
individuals with PTSD demonstrated greater mid and dorsal ACC activation relative to
a mixed control group (i.e., combination of TEC and non-trauma exposed controls
(NTC)), which is consistent with the FNM; however, they also found hypoactivation of
the precuneus. Finally, Ramage et al.17 conducted a meta-analysis of eight symptom provocation paradigms and found
that relative to a mixed control group, individuals with PTSD had greater activation
of the mid and posterior cingulate, as well as the precuneus. Taken together, the
results of these meta-analyses have led to the growing supposition that the FNM, as
tested by symptom provocation paradigms, may not fully represent the complex
neurobiology underlying disrupted affective processing in PTSD.

In an attempt to expand beyond the FNM, studies of affective processing in PTSD have
now been tested with a range of fMRI paradigms. For example, a review of recent
neuroimaging meta-analyses focusing on affective processing in adult individuals
with PTSD15,16,18 indicated the
use of a diverse set of experimental paradigms, such as affective priming, backward
masking, and tasks that employ non-trauma-related emotion stimuli. To date, only one
study has reviewed the effect of affective paradigm type on neural activity in
individuals with PTSD, though the authors selectively focused on the neural
signature of symptom provocation studies and combined all other affective tasks with
cognitive paradigms.16 As such, the first aim of this selective review is to identify task-related
fMRI paradigms commonly used in studies of affective processing in individuals with
PTSD. Next, we will classify these paradigms into a useful heuristic based on
psychological conceptual principles, similarity of stimuli used, and fMRI task
methodology. We then briefly describe the unifying principles of each category
within the classification system, the experimental aim of the paradigm category and
common methodological structure of these paradigms. Using this framework as a guide,
we summarize the common and distinct patterns of neural activity that emerged within
each paradigm classification. Considering its importance and proliferation in the
neurobiological literature, we then compare these findings to the traditional FNM.10 Finally, we speak to several factors that may contribute to the heterogeneity
of findings within the affective processing PTSD neuroimaging literature. This
review selectively focuses on neuroimaging studies of affective processing conducted
in adult individuals with PTSD and does not include neuroimaging literature produced
from cognitive tasks which employ affective stimuli (e.g., emotional Stroop). The
reader is referred to excellent comprehensive systematic reviews that have been
recently published,9 as well as meta-analyses focusing on cognitive processing of affective stimuli,16 studies of symptom provocation,15,17 the neural signature of
traumatic event type,18 and the effect of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on emotional and cognitive processing.19

Study Identification and Selection
Using keywords “PTSD,” “neuroimaging,” “fMRI,” “PET,” “SPECT,” “affect,” and
“emotion,” a literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsychInfo, and Google
Scholar for neuroimaging studies of affective processing in adults with PTSD
between the months of November and January of 2017 in order to identify
comprehensive meta-analyses of affective processing in individuals with PTSD as
compared to a control group (i.e., trauma exposed or non-trauma exposed control
participants). This search yielded six meta-analyses conducted between 2012 and
January of 2017.12,15–19 Of these meta-analyses,
one was excluded as it examined the neural circuity of PTSD with and without
mild traumatic brain injury.19 The remaining meta-analyses yielded 99 individual neuroimaging studies,
of which 26 were redundant and removed, leaving 73 studies to review based on
the following features: imaging modality (i.e., fMRI, PET, SPECT); target
samples (e.g., PTSD vs. PTSD w/ comorbid personality disorder); comparison
control group (i.e., trauma exposed controls, non-trauma exposed controls);
criterion A traumatic event type (e.g., combat, motor vehicle accident);
paradigm description and category (e.g., emotional trauma-related scenes,
Go-No-Go task; emotion, cognitive, respectively); whole brain versus region of
interest (ROI) analysis; hemodynamic response function (i.e., gamma, finite
impulse response); and multiple comparison correction (e.g., Bonferroni, False
Discovery Rate). Twenty-eight individual studies were eligible for inclusion
(please note that two additional studies were found through review of references
of meta-analyses), whereas 47 were deemed inappropriate for the scope of this
review for the following reasons: fMRI paradigms were designed to assess
cognitive functioning (e.g., episodic memory functioning) using affective
stimuli;20,21 the samples included in the study were not relevant to the
current review, such as adolescents with PTSD22 or the dissociative PTSD subtype only;23 the study assessed processing of physical pain as affective stimuli;24 the fMRI analyses were strictly correlational in nature;25 or the analyses were related to functional connectivity and not general
linear models of task-related data.23 It should be noted that individual studies without standard comparison
control groups (i.e., TEC, NT) were included; however, this was notated in
results tables (i.e., those studies were not displayed with up or down arrows
present). Finally, one article which met our criteria was included, as per the
apropos suggestion of a reviewer,26 rendering a total of 29 studies included in the current review.

“Symptom Provocation” Paradigms
These paradigms are referred to as symptom provocation, as they were originally
theorized to be key in producing re-experiencing symptoms in individuals with PTSD.8 Within this classification, two distinct types of stimuli are routinely
used: bespoke scripts of the traumatic event7,23,25,27–39 and trauma-related images,
words, sounds, and smells.26,40–43

Script-driven imagery paradigms are the most commonly used fMRI paradigms in the
neurobiological study of affective processing in PTSD7,23,25,27–39 (see Table 1). These
techniques were first introduced into the PTSD literature by Pitman et al.8 The authors argued that standard combat-related stimuli (i.e., identical
combat-related stimuli presented to all subjects) did not have the full capacity
to reproduce uniquely stressful elements of an individual’s traumatic
experience. The structure of script-driven imagery paradigms is largely
standardized with respect to paradigm structure. Generally speaking,
participants with PTSD are asked to describe a traumatic experience in as much
sensory detail as possible. These descriptions are then condensed into a 30 to
40 s personalized script written in the second person, present tense. Typically,
at least three script conditions are utilized in these paradigms: (1) a
negative, traumatic experience; (2) a neutral non-traumatic every day
experience; and (3) a baseline or recovery period. All scripts are audiotaped in
a neutral voice and played back to each participant during a neuroimaging
acquisition protocol. Procedurally, participants are typically instructed to
listen carefully as their script is being read over the course of 30 s (i.e.,
Read Period). Next, they are then encouraged to recall as many sensory details
that were associated with the traumatic event over the course of the next 30 s
(i.e., Imagery Period). Next, participants enter a rest period for 120 s and
instructed to “let go” of the traumatic memory (i.e., recovery period).

Relative to script-driven imagery tasks, paradigms which employ trauma-related
stimuli are the next most commonly utilized experimental approach to studying
affective processing in individuals with PTSD40–43 (see Table 1). Similar to
script-driven imagery approaches, these paradigms are designed to induce a
particular PTSD symptom (e.g., re-experiencing) or emotion (e.g., anxiety).
Trauma-related images that are germane to the traumatic event incurred by
participants (e.g., images of collapsed coal mines presented to individuals whom
had suffered a coal mining catastrophe), trauma-related sounds (e.g., machine
gun firing, helicopters flying, explosions), or generic combat-related images
(e.g., a man in fatigues holding a rifle) are the most commonly used type of
stimuli within this category. Typically, these paradigms include a minimum of
two conditions (i.e., trauma-related and neutral); however, some studies use a
third condition of “rest” or baseline period. Procedurally, these paradigms are
not standardized with respect to the presentation order or timing of the stimuli
(i.e., block vs. event-related fMRI design), nor the use of a common control
condition (e.g., neutral vs. a baseline rest period). Given the previous
research conducted on symptom provocation studies,15 we would expect heterogeneous findings within this paradigm
classification due to several methodological variables (e.g., comparison control
group, statistical contrast map examined). However, recent research has
suggested that individuals with PTSD may exhibit an over activated mid-line ACC
when compared to control participants while processing trauma-related stimuli.15

Results from fMRI experiments using symptom provocation paradigms have been
inconsistent and often contradictory (see Table 1 and Figure 1). With respect to amygdala
activation, some studies reported amygdala activation in individuals with PTSD
relative to no control group,7,41,42 whereas others reported
hyperactivation of the amygdala relative to NTC group42 and
hypoactivation relative to a mixed control group.30,36 Several studies under this
classification demonstrated vmPFC hypoactivation in individuals with PTSD
relative to a mixed control group,31–33,35,36 whereas some studies
demonstrated the inverse relationship.32,36 Similar patterns were
found for the rostral ACC, with studies demonstrating a trend towards
hypoactivation relative to comparison groups.30,31,33,35,38 Relative to other regions
implicated in the FNM of PTSD, there was a paucity of reported hippocampal
findings under this paradigm classification,30,36,40 which is interesting given
how these paradigms putatively rely on episodic memory.8

Conscious Trauma-Unrelated Stimuli Paradigms
This classification of paradigms is referred to as conscious trauma-unrelated, as
they employ stimuli taken from standardized stimulus sets and are not
necessarily related to the traumatic event and are processed
consciously.44–48 These paradigms are
employed in order to explore patterns of neural activation related to specific
emotion categories (e.g., fear, neutral), stimuli domain (e.g. faces, natural
scenes), or a combination of the two (e.g., fearful faces, neutral objects). The
most commonly utilized trauma-unrelated emotion stimuli are emotion faces, such
as Ekman faces,49 NimStim standardized facial expressions,50 and images from the International Affective Picture System.51 Typically, these images are presented using a block design, in a
pseudorandomized order of aversive, neutral, and baseline conditions, as the
participant passively views the images,44,47,48 although a
pseudo-randomized event-related designs have also been used.45,46 However,
it should be noted that compared to other categories within the framework
provided, the overall methodological structure of these paradigms is quite
diverse with respect to several factors, such as stimulus selection and
presentation length, control condition, as well as paradigm instruction. Results
from previous literature employing such paradigms suggest that we would find a
heterogenous pattern of neural activation within this class of studies; however,
a recent review of the PFC role in emotion processing of such studies would
suggest that the vmPFC would be hypoactivated in individuals with PTSD as
compared to control participants.52

Overall, these paradigms revealed a pattern of vmPFC deactivation in individuals
with PTSD relative to TEC47 and NTC participants46,48 (see Table 2 and Figure 2). There was some
evidence to suggest deactivation of the rostral ACC relative to TEC47 and NTC48 groups. Additionally, these paradigms demonstrated a pattern of amygdala
hyperactivation relative to both TEC47 and NTC48 groups, as well as the deactivation of this region to both control groups.46 Finally, there was a dearth of significant findings in other regions of
the traditional FNM, such as the hippocampus and dorsal ACC. Figure 2. Patterns of hyper and hypoactivation in individuals with PTSD

Unconscious Trauma-Related and Unrelated Paradigms
Unconscious trauma-related and unrelated presentation paradigms present
affectively laden stimuli outside of the participant’s conscious awareness;
stimuli may be related to the traumatic event or not germane. Such paradigms are
typically employed as a means of assessing the automaticity and unbiased neural
response to trauma-related and neutral stimuli. Additionally, such paradigms
reduce the contribution of cognitive process, as well as strategic responding.53 As such, these paradigms are thought to tap into more basic affective
behavioral54,55 and neural responses.56–58 A review of the affective
processing fMRI literature suggests that unconscious presentation paradigms are
typically employed in two manners: affective priming59,60 and backward
masking.61–63

Affective priming tasks investigate whether the unconscious evaluation of a
primary stimulus (i.e., the prime) affects the conscious processing of a
subsequent stimulus (i.e., the target).64 Commonly within fMRI PTSD research, these tasks present a prime stimulus
that is affective in nature (e.g., sad faces, trauma-related stimuli) at a
subliminal level (e.g., .15 s), followed by the rating of a neutral target
stimulus (e.g., Chinese ideographs) presented at a supraliminal level (e.g.,
1.85 s). Backwards masking paradigms test the phenomenon whereby the visibility
of a target or primary stimulus is influenced by the presentation of a secondary
stimulus.65,66 Within the affective processing PTSD literature, backward
masking tasks typically present an affective visual stimulus of interest (e.g.,
trauma-related stimuli) briefly (e.g., 16.7 ms), which is followed within
milliseconds by another visual stimulus (e.g., neutral scrambled), which
effectively “masks” the effect of seeing the primary stimulus. The general
methodological structure of unconscious presentation paradigms is quite
homogenous and typically only varies with respect to the selection of stimulus
used for the primary or secondary target. Neuroimaging research conducted in
unconscious processing of affective stimuli would suggest that the amygdala
would be consistently overrecruited in individuals with PTSD relative to control
participants under this paradigm classification.56,67

Several studies have sought to elucidate the neural mechanisms of PTSD via
unconscious presentation paradigms59–63,68 (see Table 3 and Figure 3). Taken together,
these paradigms routinely demonstrated that when unconsciously processing
affective relative to neutral information, individuals with PTSD activated the
amygdala to a greater extent when compared to trauma-exposed control
participants,60,63,68 as well as to non-trauma exposed control participants.59 Indeed, only one unconscious presentation paradigm did not report
amygdala hyperactivity in individuals with PTSD.61 Paradigms within this classification, however, did not consistently
demonstrate hyper or hypoactivation of additional brain regions within the
traditional neurocircuitry model of PTSD. For example, only one study
demonstrated hyperactivity in the PTSD group of the left hippocampus61 relative to non-trauma exposed control participants. Figure 3. Patterns of hyper and hypoactivation in individuals with PTSD

Summary
Overall, we found that task-based fMRI paradigms largely fell into three coherent
categories: symptom provocation, trauma-unrelated emotion, and unconscious
presentation. In general, patterns of activation within each paradigm class revealed
mixed results that cannot be solely attributed to task type. One exception to this
general observation is the results of the unconscious presentation paradigms (Table 3 and Figure 3), which among all
three paradigm classifications demonstrated the greatest reproducibility with
respect to amygdala hyperactivation in individuals with PTSD, when compared to a
mixed control group and control condition. This result was also underscored in a
recent review focusing on the role of the amygdala in processing emotive and
cognitive stimuli.69 Indeed, a number of neuroimaging studies have established the amygdala’s role
in the automatic processing of affective stimuli.56,58,63,70,71 Importantly, unconscious
presentation paradigms are often passive processing tasks, which have been shown to
be a significant predictor of amygdala activation, as compared to tasks with
explicit instruction72 (e.g., label the emotion of the stimuli). Furthermore, the amygdala is
believed to be a key member of the salience network, an intrinsic connectivity
network responsible for the detection and orientation to both internal, as well as
external stimuli.11 As such, unconscious presentation paradigms may be particularly effective at
eliciting differences in salience detection among individuals with PTSD, as compared
to control participants. Paradigms which fell within the symptom provocation
category exhibited a pattern of hyperactivation in the dACC and hypoactivation in
the vmPFC in individuals with PTSD (Figure 1). Hyperactivation and hypoactivation were reported in other
brain regions (Figure 1),
though the directionality of results were not consistent across studies. Similarly,
trauma-unrelated emotion paradigms revealed a pattern of vmPFC and rACC deactivation
among individuals with PTSD, though results were not consistent across studies.
Finally, as shown in Tables
1 to 3, we
did not observe different patterns of findings from studies that included
participants with different trauma types (e.g., combat vs. civilian trauma). Taken
together, these results provide limited support for the FNM of PTSD within and
across paradigm classification of affective processing studies.

The heterogeneity of results found in the aforementioned literature may be compounded
by several biological and analytic factors. One such biological factor is related to
the level of threat intensity associated with the traumatic event. Threat intensity
refers to the propensity of a traumatic occurrence to lead to a lasting stress response.73 The threat intensity of the traumatic event is assessed across several
domains, including severity, frequency, unpredictability, uncontrollability, and the
inescapable nature of the traumatic event.73–75 Recent research has suggested
that levels of threat intensity (e.g., mass shooting vs. 12-month active combat tour
of duty) may be correlated with differential chronic stress pathology (CSP) burden,
subsequently leading to varied patterns of biological abnormalities.73–75 Despite this and often in
order to meet sample size and power requirements, neurobiological studies of PTSD
tend to aggregate individuals into “mixed samples” and average CSP across different
index traumas. Thus, larger study samples of individuals with PTSD may contain
subsamples with differential threat intensities, CSP, and thus concomitant
biological alterations. For example, recent research has suggested that CSP may be
associated with functional and structural changes due to differential synaptic
connectivity patterns.75 A dual pathology model was proposed, which highlights the possibility that
trauma and stress may be associated with two distinct pathophysiological processes,
that is, aminoacid-based pathology (ABP) versus monoamine-based pathology (MBP76). ABP is associated with treatment resistance to monoaminergic
antidepressants, deficit in prefrontal and hippocampal gray matter, and
dysregulation in glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission. In
contrast, MBP is associated with enhanced response to monoaminergic antidepressants,
gain in nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala gray matter, and dysregulation in
serotonin and catecholamines.75 ABP is consistent with glutamate dysregulation and excitotoxicity,
precipitating reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptic
loss in the PFC and hippocampus. Specifically, ABP is hypothesized to disrupt
glucocorticoid signaling, leading to increased neuronal inflammation, and
impoverished astrocytic uptake of glutamate within the synapsis, resulting in
extracellular glutamate and excitotoxicity. Conversely, MBP is thought to be related
to disruption in norepinephrine and dopamine signaling leading to localized increase
in BDNF and synaptic gain in the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala.75 As such, this model suggests that individuals with ABP-based pathology may
have differential patterns of neuronal firing, as compared to individuals with a
predominate MBP-based pathology, thus potentially contributing to the heterogeneity
found in the PTSD neuroimaging literature.

With respect to analytic factors, a whole brain versus ROI approach may significantly
contribute to the heterogeneity of findings within this literature. For example,
approximately half of the studies included in this selective review used amygdala
ROI analyses, of which 83% reported activation. Conversely, only three of the
remaining studies which did not employ a ROI analysis reported amygdala activation.
Although we contend that ROI analyses are useful for restricting analyses to
specific brain regions and controlling for Type I error by limiting the number of
statistical tests, this analytic approach is not without limitation.77 For example, Sprooten et al. conducted a meta-analysis on the results of
studies which employed task-fMRI data in a range of psychiatric disorders (i.e.,
schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and
obsessive-compulsive disorder) and found that on a region-by-region basis, ROI
studies accounted for the over-representation of the amygdala and caudate nucleus
activation, which was not supported when whole-brain studies were considered. These
findings suggested that the a priori selection of a ROI, in addition to the
neuroimaging fields’ resistance against publishing negative results, may lead to the
over-simplification and over-localization of psychiatric neurobiological models.
Future studies exploring the neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD symptomology may
choose to move beyond an ROI approach and use alternative statistical methodologies
(e.g., multi-voxel pattern analysis) to explore large-scale distributed sub-cortical
to cortical networks.78 For example, multi-voxel pattern analysis techniques allow for neuroimaging
data to be reduced to highly reproducible special patterns of activity through a
supervised classification classifier.79

The choice of comparison group and contrast condition may be additional analytic
factors contributing to contradictory patterns of neural activity within this
literature. The selection of a comparison group is often contingent upon paradigm
design. For example, researchers using a script-driven symptom provocation design
often employ a TEC group, as the nature of the experimental design requires that the
control group have exposure to a traumatic event. Whereas other design types, such
as unconscious presentation paradigms, often use comparison groups that are naïve to
trauma (i.e., NTC). To address the relevance of comparison group, Patel et al.12 conducted two separate meta-analyses in individuals with PTSD relative to TEC
and NTC groups. The results of their study revealed that those with PTSD exhibited
amygdala hyperactivation relative to NTC and not TEC groups, thus indicating that
this pattern of activation may be, at least partially, a neural marker of trauma
exposure and not pathophysiology of PTSD per se.12 Relatedly, there is variability with respect to selection of a consistent
control condition. For example, script-driven symptom provocation studies
demonstrated the use of a generic neutral and “teeth clenching” neutral37,38 conditions, as
well as the use of an implicit baseline control condition (i.e., fixation condition,
wherein the participant is staring at a fixation) when performing statistical
contrasts.31–35

Finally, variable statistical thresholding approaches to data analysis may be yet
another analytic factor contributing to divergent neuroimaging results of affective
processing in PTSD. We concede that many of the studies included in this review were
conducted in the nascent stages of the neuroimaging field and before specific
guidelines of statistical reporting were specified.80–82 That being said, we observed a
variety of liberal statistical thresholds when addressing multiple comparisons
corrections. For example, a number of the studies reviewed here did not report a
correction for multiple comparisons (see Tables 1, 2, and 3), used a fixed effects statistical model,
liberal cluster-based inference correction (e.g., p < 0.05; 3
voxel cluster extent), or employed an arbitrary voxel-based inference correction
(e.g., p < 0.001) when reporting their findings. Although we
acknowledge that several of these studies are exploratory in nature and therefore
amenable to liberal thresholding, we recommend that future confirmatory studies
adhere to current minimal statistical standards.80–83

Limitations
A chief limitation of the current review is the availability of studies which met our
criteria for inclusion and our reliance on studies which were included in recent
meta-analyses. Although our original search criteria identified five meta-analyses
which met criteria, resulting in 99 eligible studies, further inspection deemed
nearly half of these ineligible, largely due to the utilization of a cognitive
paradigm structure. As such, we acknowledge that the scope of this review narrowly
focuses on affective processing paradigms conducted in individuals with PTSD.
Relatedly, another limitation of the current review is in our utilization of the FNM
as a framework for assessing results of the aforementioned affective studies, as the
FNM was formulated upon the results of a multitude of studies which used diverse
stimuli and a variety of paradigm structures (e.g., conditioning and extinction,
episodic memory, inhibition, passive viewing, affective processing).

Conclusions and Future Directions
The neural systems subserving affective processing in individuals with PTSD have been
examined using several experimental designs over the last two decades. A selective
review of this literature found that affective tasks coalesce into a useful
heuristic with three categories: symptom provocation, trauma-unrelated emotion, and
unconscious presentation. Although neural patterns of activation remain
heterogeneous, we did observe that unconscious presentation paradigms were superior
in eliciting amygdala hyperactivation in individuals with PTSD relative to a
comparison control group. This finding offers partial support for the FNM of PTSD,
though we contend that this model may be lacking in its ability to account for the
neurobiological complexity of the disorder. Although several biological and analytic
factors can account for a portion of heterogeneity, future research remains
warranted to advance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms governing
affective processing in PTSD. The results of our qualitative review, in addition to
the findings from quantitative meta-analyses containing affective processing
studies, suggest the need for a better understanding of trauma-related, as well as
analytic variables involved in interpreting emerging patterns of neural signal.
Further investigations are warranted for analyses which take these factors into
greater consideration with respect to their role in neural alterations associated
with PTSD.
