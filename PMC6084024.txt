verbal WM. Previous research has suggested that verbal WM performance is
determined by the duration instead of the number of verbal materials. We
investigated in the present study to what degree that the number and the

without professional musical training. The forward tonal discrimination task in
Experiment 1 tested the maintenance of the tonal information and the backward
N-back tonal task in Experiment 2 probed the running memory span of tonal
information. Results show that the number of notes, but not the duration of
notes in a tone sequence significantly affects tonal WM performance for both
musicians and non-musicians. In addition, within a minimum musical context,
musicians outperformed non-musicians in the N-back tonal task but not the
forward tone sequence discrimination task. These findings indicate that the
capacity of tonal WM is determined by the number of notes but not the duration
of notes in a sequence to be memorized, suggesting a different mechanism
underlying tonal WM from verbal WM. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated
that N-back tonal task is a quantitative and sensitive measure of the effect of
musical training on tonal WM.

Introduction
Working memory (WM) refers to a cognitive system where information is temporarily
stored with a limited capacity that allows for online manipulation of the maintained
information [1–3]. Auditory WM stores both
phonological information that form verbal representations such as words and
phonemes, and non-phonological information such as pitch, speech prosody, and timbre
[1,4,5]. The latter is referred to as the tonal WM.
Behavioral studies have suggested that the tonal WM involves different mechanisms
than the verbal WM [4,6–8]. For example, the interference between two
verbal WM tasks is stronger than the interference between a verbal WM task and a
tonal WM task [7,8]. Another piece of supporting
evidence is that amusics exhibit deficits in the pitch memory but not in the verbal
memory [9–14]. Neural imaging studies
have shown that certain brain areas are specifically involved in the tonal WM but
not in the verbal WM [15–18].

An important question addressed by researchers studying auditory WM is whether the
number of items or the duration of stimulus determines the capacity limit of WM
[19–21]. It has been shown that participants’
performance in verbal WM tasks depends on the length of a verbal sequence to be
memorized; the longer the sequence, the poorer the performance [3,19]. The effect of sequence length has also
been examined in other studies, showing that participants’ memory span for sequences
consisting long words was smaller than short words with fewer syllables or shorter
duration, the so-called “the word length effect” [3,20,21]. However, regardless of the difference
between verbal and tonal WM, whether the number of notes or the length of note
sequence or both, determines the capacity of tonal WM remains unclear.

It has been shown that the capacity of verbal WM is modulated by the articulatory
time of the words. A few studies have investigated the influence of tone duration on
tonal WM. which was referred to as the “music length effect” in parallel to the
“word length effect” in verbal WM. Akiva-Kabiri et al. (2016) examined the effect of
music length on tonal WM by testing participants in a tonal discrimination task
[22]. They found that
both the length of tone sequences and the rate of presentation (tempo) influenced
participants’ performance and a significant interaction between the two factors was
also observed. Schulze (2012) showed that both musician and non-musician’s WM
performance decreased as the length of tone sequence increased [23]. Albouy et al. (2016)
reported that pitch memory in amusics increased with increased tone duration [24]. However, other studies
have challenged these findings. Using six-tone sequences without explicit musical
structure as the testing materials, Li et al. (2013) showed that only the number of
notes defined the capacity of tonal WM [25]. In the present study, we re-examined this
issue and investigated the factors that influence tonal WM performance by varying
the number of notes systematically and changing the duration of notes in auditory
tone sequences independently. We hypothesize that if the number of notes is the
factor that determines the capacity of tonal WM, participants’ WM performance should
not be significantly different between a quarter note sequence and an eighth note
sequence of the number of notes but different length. On the other hand, if the
length of a tone sequence is the factor that determines the capacity of tonal WM,
participants’ WM performance should not be different between a quarter note sequence
and an eighth note sequence of the same length but different number of notes.

When measuring the limit of verbal WM, two types of tasks have been used in previous
studies, e.g., forward digit span or sentence recognition tasks for the capacity of
the storage and maintenance of information [26,27], and backward digit span or word
identification for the online manipulation of remembered verbal information [28,29]. The forward paradigm was commonly used to
study tonal WM [22,25]. Dowling investigated tonal
WM in non-musicians using forward standard melody, inversion of pitch contour of
standard melody, and backward retrograde transformation of standard melody as
testing materials [30]. Using
forward and backward sequence recognition tasks, Schulze and colleagues studied the
influence of musical structure on WM performance in musicians and non-musicians
[23]. These studies,
however, only tested the maintenance and manipulation of tone information in terms
of pitch contour perception. The memory limit of individual tones was not directly
revealed by responding if the orders of tone sequences were the same or different.
While the N-back paradigms being a typical task for investigating verbal WM capacity
[29,31,32], was rarely reported in the measurement of
tonal WM [25]. The N-back
paradigm evokes several WM processes such as monitoring, updating, and manipulation
of remembered information and it has been commonly used as an assessment to measure
WM capacity [29,31–35]. To examine the processes of individual
tones, we adopted in the present study both forward tonal discrimination task and
backward N-back tonal task in assessing the tonal WM performance.

Musical training is believed to be an influential factor on WM performance,
especially for a music-related ability such as tonal WM. Studies have shown that the
processing of structured and unstructured tone sequences is different in musicians,
but not in non-musicians [15,36–38]. Lerdahl and Jackendoff
reported that musical grouping rules help segment a sequence of tones into its
constituent subgroups [39],
which could significantly enhance musicians’ performance in certain tonal WM tasks.
This notion was supported by findings by other researchers that musicians performed
better in WM tasks using tonal rather than atonal sequences as testing materials
[15,40–44], suggesting that musicians’ knowledge of
musical regularities plays a role in tonal WM. We further examined these issues in
the present study. To test the influence of music structure on WM performance,
Experiment 1 used two types of testing materials, the conventional musical sequences
that strictly obey the regularities of Western tonal music and random tone
sequences. In Experiment 2, we designed different types of adjacent notes to the
target note using an N-back paradigm to avoid the interference of explicit knowledge
of music on the tonal WM performance.

In summary, in the present study, we aimed to answer the question whether the number
of notes or the length of note sequence defines the capacity of tonal WM. We
assessed the capacity of tonal WM with two tasks, the forward tonal discrimination
task (Experiment 1) that reflects the ability of the maintenance of tonal
information, and the backward N-back tonal task (Experiment 2) that reflects the
limits of the manipulating of individual tone information in tonal WM. We also
examined the role of possible notes grouping in the manipulation of tonal sequence
independent of the influence of explicit musical structure.

Materials and methods
All experimental procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins University.

Experiment 1: Tonal discrimination task
Participants
Sixteen musicians and sixteen non-musicians were recruited from the Johns
Hopkins University community and tested in Experiment 1. Musicians had at
least 5 years of formal musical training (mean = 11.83 years, SD = 5.62
years), and were musically active at the time of the testing. None of the
participants in the musician group reported possessing absolute pitch. For
the non-musician group, the participants did not have any formal musical
training apart from basic compulsory music classes prior to college. All
participants reported having normal hearing. Some participants received
course credit and others received a nominal fee for participating in testing
sessions (up to 1 hour each session). Informed consent was obtained from all
participants.

Stimuli
The experiments were conducted in a double-walled sound-attenuating chamber
(IAC-1020). Acoustic stimuli were delivered to the participant via
circumaural sealed headphones (HDA 200, Sennheiser, Old Lyme, CT) through a
TDT RZ6 system (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). Stimuli were
delivered at a comfortable sound level (65–75 dB) adjusted according to each
participant’s report. Testing protocols were executed with a custom MATLAB
(Mathworks, Natick, MA) program developed in our laboratory.

Two types of tone sequences were used as testing materials: musical tone
sequences (MTSs) and random tone sequences (RTSs). MTSs are tone sequences
composed of seven musical notes from C major scale (C4: 261.63Hz, D4:
293.66Hz, E4: 329.63Hz, F4: 349.23Hz, G4: 392Hz, A4: 440Hz, B4: 493.88Hz) by
a musician that are tonally structured as defined by the Western tonal
system. RTSs are the repetitions of the same rhythm as those of MTSs, but
with the notes randomly chosen from the same set of musical notes using a
random permutation algorithm in MATLAB, where the tones do not have an
obvious tonal structure (S2 Fig). Two musicians who did not
participate in the experiments were asked to subjectively rate the tonality
of the MRSs and RTSs using a 10 points scale in which 1 represents the least
tonality and 10 represents the most tonality. Results show that RTSs were
rated significantly lower than MTSs (two sample t-test, p<0.001). Fig 1B shows some MTSs and
RTSs examples generated with the method described.

Each note was a synthesized pure tone (sine wave) modulated by an envelope
that linearly increased from zero to the maximum amplitude at 1/8 of the
note duration, and then linearly decreased to zero for the remainder of the
note (Fig 1A, right
inset). The modulation envelope of the notes produced a more natural timbre
than that of pure tones. A testing sequence consisted of either 1/4 or 1/8
notes without gaps between notes (see Fig 1A). The note duration was 800 ms for
1/4 note and 400ms for 1/8 note. Testing sequences were presented to
participants at the speed of 75 beats per minute (bpm), resulting in a beat
duration of 800ms. Each bar (or measure) was a segment of 1600ms,
corresponding to two beats or two notes for 1/4 notes and four notes for 1/8
notes. Each testing sequence contained between 1–6 measures, corresponding
to 2–12 notes for the 1/4 note condition and 4–24 notes for the 1/8 note
condition, respectively. Thus, the durations of sequences were the same for
1/4 and 1/8 note conditions. The testing sequences were randomly presented
to participants. The two note conditions were tested in different
blocks.

There were four testing blocks for each participant: 1/4 note MTS, 1/4 note
RTS, 1/8 note MTS, and 1/8 note RTS. For each testing block, there were 6
measure conditions with 10 trials in each condition. 60 trials were
completed for each testing block, and a total of 240 trials were completed
for each participant in Experiment 1. In half of the trials, the pair of
sequences was identical (“same trials”). For the other half of the trials,
the pair of sequences was different only by one note, which was shifted up
or down by one semitone (“different trials”). Only notes C, E, F and B from
the seven original notes were selected for the pitch shift so that the
“different trials” remained as musically structured for MTSs and randomly
organized for RTSs. The overall pitch contours for the pair of sequences
were the same in both types of trials (Fig 1C, left).

Examples of a quarter (1/4) note sequence (left)
and an eighth (1/8) note sequence (right) with two
measures. Bottom plots: amplitude profiles of the
note sequences shown on the top. Each measure consists of two beats,
in which one beat corresponds to one note for the quarter note
sequence and two notes for the eighth note sequence.

(left) or 10 notes (right).
(C) Examples of testing
sequence pairs. Left: Experiment 1, tonal
discrimination task. The upper row is a match trial
consisting of a pair of identical note sequences. The lower
row is an example of mismatch trial, in which a note in
the second sequence (gray note) is shifted up one semitone, but the
pitch contour (dashed line) remains the same as the first sequence.
The pitch shifts of mismatch trials happen in both directions,
upwards or downwards. Right: Experiment 2, N-back
tonal task. An example of N = 3 testing condition. The upper
row is a match trial, in which the probe note (the last
note) is the same as the reference note (the 3rd to the last note).
The lower row are mismatch novel note trials
where the probe note is different from any prior notes in the
sequence. In the mismatch adjacent note trial
(right) the probe note is the same as a note
prior to the reference note ((N+1)th note condition).

Procedures
During a trial, participants were asked to report whether the pair of
sequences was the same or different by pressing one of two buttons on a
response box. No feedback was provided to the participants. Participants’
responses and response times were recorded. For each trial, the two
sequences were presented with a 1-second interval between them. The first
sequence was the reference and the second sequence was the target.
Participants could respond at any time when the target sequence was played.
If a participant responded after the presence of the manipulated note in the
“different trials” or after the last note in the “same trials”, the response
was recorded as a valid response. If a participant responded before the
presence of the manipulated note in the “different trials” or before the
last note in the “same trials”, the response was recorded as an invalid
response. Participants could decide how many blocks they would like to
participate and when to terminate the testing. Data acquired from
participants who completed all four testing blocks and with the valid
response rate no less than 80% were included in the analysis reported here,
which means each individual participant completed all 1/4 and 1/8 MTS and
RTS testing blocks, and participant had at least 8 valid trials out of 10
trials for each bar/measure testing condition. Data from 13 musicians and 15
non-musicians in MTS tasks and 11 musicians and 11 non-musicians in RTS
tasks were included in statistical analyses. The participant’s correct
response rate was linearized to "rational arcsine units" (RAUs) by the
rationalized arcsine transform [45].

Experiment 2: N-back tonal task
Participants
Participant recruitment procedures and criteria were similar to those
described in Experiment 1. Twenty-one musician and eighteen non-musician
participants participated in Experiment 2. Some participants received course
credit and others received a nominal fee for participation. Two sessions
were tested. Each testing session consisted of 5 blocks and lasted up to 1
hour. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Stimuli
Twelve musical notes within one octave of middle frequency (ranging from
261.63 Hz to 493.88 Hz) were used to generate random tone sequences (e.g.,
C4, C#4/Db4, D4, D#4/Eb4, E4,
F4, F#4/Gb4, G4, G#4/Ab4, A4,
A#4/Bb4, and B4). Each sequence consisted of 9 to
12 notes with two note duration conditions (1/4 note and 1/8 note) which
were randomly permutated except for the last note, which was manipulated
based on the N conditions. The testing sequences generated from two note
conditions and different numbers of notes were tested on each participant in
a randomized order. The experiment was conducted in the same
sound-attenuating chamber using the same experimental system as used in
Experiment 1. Twenty-two participants tested in Exp 1 also participated in
Exp 2, including 10 musicians and 11 non-musicians.

Procedure
During the experiment, participants were instructed to listen to the whole
sequence carefully and then to identify whether the last note (the probe
note) was the same or different from the reference note presented N notes
prior to the last note in the sequence, referred to hereafter as the
Nth reference note (Fig 1C, right). Participants indicated
their response by pressing the “same” or “different” button on a response
box. N was set to 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 for each testing block based on results
from pilot experiments to avoid floor and ceiling effects. For each session,
half of the trials contained a probe note being identical to the
Nth reference note. These trials were referred to as “match
trials”. The other half of the trials were “mismatch trials”, among which
50% of trials had the probe note being a novel note (i.e., different from
any notes presented prior to it), 25% trials had the probe note being the
same as the (N + 1)th note and 25% trials had the probe note
being the same as the (N + 2)th note (Fig 1C, right). We referred to these
three types of “mismatch” trials as “novel note” and “adjacent note” ((N +
1)th or (N + 2)th note) conditions (Fig 1C, right). There were
no more than two identical notes in any of the sequences. The experiment
consisted a total of 10 testing blocks (N = 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), 5 each for
1/4 note and 1/8 note conditions. Testing sequences in each block had a
fixed N but a different number of notes (9, 10, 11, and 12) with 10 randomly
generated copies and presented to participants in a randomized order. Before
each testing block, participants were told the number of N of that block, so
that they knew where the reference note they were looking for to compare
with the last note. A total of 40 testing sequences in a block were randomly
generated for each note number condition (9, 10, 11, and 12 notes) with 10
repeats. Data were acquired from 16 musicians and 16 non-musicians.
Participants that completed all testing blocks for either the 1/4 or 1/8
note condition or both, were included in further analysis. For the control
analysis of training effect and mismatch trials, the corrected accuracy was
calculated.

Results
Experiment 1: Tonal discrimination task
Using the forward discrimination paradigm (Fig 1C, left), we measured participants’
ability to maintain tonal information in their WM system, as well as the effect
of the duration of sequence and the number of note on the WM performance.
Participants were asked to discriminate a pair of tone sequences and report
whether the sequences were the same or different. Two types of tone sequences
were used as testing materials, musical tone sequences (MTSs) and random tone
sequences (RTSs) (Fig 1B).
With this experimental design, the influence of musical context and previous
musical training on WM capacity was also examined.

We conducted an overall ANOVA on the participants’ response to examine the
effects of measure number (the duration of sequence), note duration (quarter vs.
eighth note), sequence type (MTS vs. RTS), and musical training (musician vs.
non-musician) using the statistical tools of MATLAB. Results showed significant
main effects of measure number (F(5, 552) = 96.89, p
< 0.01, ηp2 = 0.467), note duration (F(1,
552) = 71.08, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.114), and musical training (F(1,
552) = 55.92, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.092) but not sequence type (F(1,
552) = 0.31, p = 0.576, ηp2 = 0.001). However, the interaction between
musical training and sequence type was significant (F(1, 552) =
13.32, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.024, S1 Fig). In
the MTS condition, musicians had significantly better performance than
non-musicians (t(334) = 6.461, p < 0.001), while in the RTS
condition, there was no significant difference between the two groups
(t(262) = 1.656, p = 0.099). We thus examined the influence of
the duration of note and the number of notes on WM performance on the two groups
for MTS and RTS conditions separately.

MTS condition
Fig 2 shows the results
in the MTS condition. Fig 2A
and 2C plot the performance of musicians (2A) and non-musicians
(2C) as a function of the number of measures in a sequence.
Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects of music training
(F(1, 26) = 19.02, p < 0.01,
ηp2 = 0.422), the number of measures
(F(5, 130) = 56.05, p < 0.01,
ηp2 = 0.683) and note duration (F(1,
26) = 27.52, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.514). As the number of measures
increases, participants’ performance declined in both groups. For a certain
measure number, the quarter note condition contains only half of notes as in
the eighth note condition, participants’ performance for quarter notes was
better than eighth notes. For musicians (Fig 2A), the effects of measure number
(F(5, 60) = 33.54, p < 0.01,
ηp2 = 0.736) and note duration (F(1,
12) = 23.92, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.666) were both significant.
Musicians’ RAU accuracy for quarter note sequences was better than that for
eighth note sequences with two (t(12) = 3.81, p
< 0.05) and three measures (t(12) = 3.59, p
< 0.05, One-tail paired t-test with Bonferroni correction). For
non-musicians (Fig 2C),
the effect of measure number was significant (F(5, 70) = 25.10,
p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.642), as well as note duration
(F(1, 14) = 5.14, p < 0.05,
ηp2 = 0.269). Non-musicians had
significantly higher RAU accuracy for 1/4 than 1/8 note sequences with only
one measure (t(14) = 3.32, p < 0.05).

lines in all plots represent the chance level. Error bars are
corrected S.E.M across participants. Stars mark the significant
difference comparing to the chance level.

We then compared participants’ performance between quarter and eighth notes
conditions as a function of the number of notes in a sequence. As expected,
RAU value dropped as the number of notes increased. Repeated-measures ANOVA
showed that the number of notes significantly influenced the performance
(F(2, 52) = 41.54, p < 0.01,
ηp2 = 0.606). However, the participants’
performance for quarter and eighth note sequences was not significantly
different (F(1, 26) = 4.09, p = 0.054,
ηp2 = 0.121), for neither musicians (Fig 2B) nor non-musicians
(Fig 2D).

We, therefore, combined the data of quarter and eighth conditions as a
function of the number of notes in further analysis (Fig 2E). Repeated-measures ANOVA
(between-participants factors: musicians vs. non-musicians;
within-participants factors: 6 number of measures and 2 note durations)
revealed a significant difference between musicians and non-musicians
(F(1, 26) = 15.43, p < 0.01,
ηp2 = 0.962). The musicians outperformed
the non-musicians for note numbers up to 16 (p < 0.05,
one-tail t-test with Bonferroni correction), except for note numbers of 2
and 8 (p > 0.05). Musicians’ RAU accuracy was significantly higher than
the chance level at consecutive note numbers up to 16. Non-musicians’
performance drops faster than the musician participants and approached to
the chance level when the note number was above 8. The results in Fig 2E show that both
musicians and non-musicians are able to keep a certain number of musically
organized notes in their WM to perform the tone sequence discrimination
task, and that musicians could remember more notes at a time than
non-musicians.

RTS condition
The testing sequences used in the RTS condition had no explicit musical
structures (see Methods). Again,
the participants’ performance declined as the number of measures and the
number of notes increased for musicians (Fig 3A and 3B) and non-musicians (Fig 3C and 3D). However,
no significant effect of note duration (quater vs. eighth note) was observed
for both groups at a given number of notes. Repeated-measure ANOVA showed
that both the number of measures (F(5, 100) = 64.04,
p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.762) and the note duration
(F(1, 20) = 38.38, p < 0.01,
ηp2 = 0.657) significantly influenced the
participants’ performance. The performance for quarter note sequences was
significantly better than eighth note sequences when the number of measures
were 2 (t(10) = 7.32, p < 0.05) and 3
(t(10) = 3.46, p < 0.05) for musicians,
and 2 (t(10) = 3.81, p < 0.05) for
non-musicians (one-tail paired t-test with Bonferroni correction). However,
unlike the result of the MTS condition, musicians and non-musicians showed
no significant difference in their WM performance with RTS sequences.

No significant effect of note duration (1/4 or 1/8) was observed for either
musicians or non-musicians at a given number of notes. Thus, Fig 3E plots the results
after combining the data of quarter and eighth conditions as a function of
number of notes. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between
the two groups across all note numbers (Fig 3E, p > 0.05,
two-tail two-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction), though the RAU
accuracy was significantly above the chance level up to 16 notes for
musicians and 10 notes for non-musicians (p < 0.05,
one-tail t-test with Bonferroni correction). We conclude from the results of
the RTS condition that when there was no explicit musical structure in a
tonal sequence, musicians and non-musicians showed no significant difference
in their WM performance, in contrast to the observation in the MTS condition
(Fig 2E).

Experiment 2: N-back tonal task
In Experiment 2, we examined participants’ ability to recognize a reference note
in a random tone sequence that was presented prior to a probe note using a
backward N-back testing paradigm (Fig 1C, right), with the assumption that participants need to keep
the ongoing tonal sequence in WM system in order to judge if the reference note
matched the probe note. The number of notes presented between the reference note
and the probe note is taken as the limit of WM capacity that allows for
participants online manipulating or updating tonal information in their WM
system. A univariate ANOVA was conducted that revealed a significant difference
in performance between musicians and non-musicians (F(1, 79) = 34.47,
p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.028). When the data of the two groups
were analyzed separately, the main effect of N was significant, for both
musicians (F(4, 316) = 50.94, p < 0.01, Welch F
test) and non-musicians (F(4, 39) = 23.87, p <
0.01, ηp2 = 0.133). No difference between the quarter
and eighth note conditions was observed for either group. Fig 4A (musicians) and 4B (non-musicians)
plot RAU values as a function of the number of notes between the probe and
reference notes. In Fig 4C,
we combined RAU values calculated from results with the quarter and eighth note
conditions. The musicians’ performance was significantly better than the chance
level for N up to 6. Whereas the non-musicians’ performance was above chance
level when N was 2, 3 and 5. Detailed comparison between the two groups across N
conditions and the comparison between participants’ performance with chance
level are show in Table
1.

Error analysis
We further analyzed the participants’ error patterns made with the two types
of mismatch probe notes, novel and adjacent notes (see Methods, Fig 1C, right), in terms of RAU accuracy
using the univariate ANOVA (N × probe note type). As shown in Fig 5A, for musicians, the
RAU values in novel notes trials were significantly better than that in
adjacent notes trials (F(1, 9) = 4.48, p <
0.05, ηp2 = 0.022). However, for non-musicians
(Fig 5B), there was
no significant difference between novel notes and adjacent notes trials
(F(1, 9) = 3.35, p = 0.069, ηp2 = 0.020).

tonal task.

non-musicians (B) as a function of the
notes between the reference and probe notes (N) when the probe note

the reference note (grey curve). The performance is plotted as the
accuracy (RAU). Horizontal dash lines in all plots represent the
chance level. Error bars are corrected S.E.M across
participants.

We concluded from the N-back tonal task results that musicians and
non-musicians could only manipulate at least 5 and 2 notes respectively in
their working memory system for further cognitive processing, regardless of
the note duration, in consisting with our findings from Experiment 1. In
addition, compared to non-musicians, musicians WM performance are more
influenced by notes that adjacent to reference notes. These results indicate
that the notes occurred at the adjacent position to a reference note
interfered with the recognition of the reference note for musicians but not
non-musicians, suggesting that musicians memorize tonal information in
chunks whereas non-musicians memorize tonal information in individual
notes.

Task-related learning effects
We have also evaluated the effects of task-related learning effects on WM
ability by separating the trials into 4 stages based on the time of testing
(Fig 6). There was
no significant difference among the 4 testing stages in MTS (F(1,
37) = 0.27, p = 0.69, ηp2 = 0.01) and RTS tasks (F(2,
39) = 0.17, p = 0.84, ηp2 = 0.008) with Greenhouse-Geisser
correction. Neither musicians nor non-musicians showed significant learning
effect. Participants’ WM ability remained consistent across all 4 stages.
More importantly, musicians’ out performed non-musicians at all 4 testing
stages (Fig 6A) (stage
1: t(26) = 3.27, p < 0.001; stage 2:
t(26) = 3.88, p < 0.001; stage 3:
t(26) = 4.76, p < 0.001; stage 4:
t(26) = 4.20, p < 0.001) only in the MTS
condition (F(1, 26) = 17.63, p < 0.001,
ηp2 = 0.404). No difference was found in
any of the 4 stages in the RTS condition (Fig 6B) (stage 1: t(26) =
1.76, p = 0.09; stage 2: t(26) = 1.33,
p = 0.20; stage 3: t(26) = 1.31,
p = 0.21; stage 4: t(26) = 1.49,
p = 0.15) between musicians and non-musicians
(F(1, 20) = 2.45, p = 0.13, ηp2 = 0.109).

condition in Experiment 1. Musicians’ performance is significantly

(B) RTS condition in

Musicians’ performance is significantly higher than non-musicians at
stages 1, 2, and 3, but not at stage 4. The significant difference
was marked as stars.

Analyses of Experiment 2 data are shown in Fig 6C. The effect of task-related
learning or testing time order did not significantly influence subjects’
performance, F(3, 111) = 1.55, p = 0.21, ηp2 = 0.04. No difference was observed at
any of the 4 testing stages for either musicians or non-musicians. Again,
the main effect of musical training was statistically significant (F(1, 37)
= 10.15, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.215). Musicians’ performance was
significantly better than non-musicians (stage 1: t(37) = 2.98, p <
0.001; stage 2: t(37) = 2.21, p < 0.01; stage 3: t(37) = 2.90, p <
0.01), but not in stage 4 (t(20) = 1.79, p = 0.08).

These results further confirmed our conclusion on the music training effect
we drawn from the analysis with RAU value comparison between the two groups,
indicating that musicians’ WM outperformed non-musicians in both maintenance
and manipulation of tonal information in tonal WM.

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that the number of items and the articulation times of
the items are two factors affecting verbal WM [19,21,46]. Researchers have reported that the
articulation time significantly influences the capacity limits of verbal WM,
indicating the major contribution of sub-vocal rehearsal to verbal WM [21,22]. In the present study, we systematically
manipulated the number of notes in a sequence and the length of a tone sequence. As
shown in Fig 2A and 2C (musical
sequence) and Fig 3A and 3C
(random sequence) for Experiment 1, participants’ sensitivity to tonal information
decreased as the number of measures varied from 1 to 6 such that the length of
tested sequences varied correspondingly between 1.6 and 9.6 seconds. The results
seem to agree with the previous finding of “the word length effect” on the verbal WM
capacity [20,21]. However, when the number
of notes was fixed at 4, 8, or 12 (Fig
2B and 2D and Fig 3B
and 2D), although the length of
quarter note sequence was two times longer than that of eighth note sequence,
participants’ WM performance was not different. In the N-back tonal task (Fig 4A and 4B), again,
participants’ WM performance was found not different between the two note duration
conditions. The present study does not reveal the sequence length effect. Neither
the duration of note (quarter note vs. eighth note) in a tonal sequence nor the
length of the note sequence significantly influenced participants’ performance when
the number of note was fixed. The two duration conditions were chosen in our study
(400 and 800ms) based on previous studies on the acoustically dominant time scale of
a large dataset of music which shown that the peak of the temporal modulations
frequency range of musical beats is at 0.5–3 Hz [47]. In addition, typical dancing music usually
has the tempi of 94–176 beats per minute that corresponds to 1.6–2.9 Hz in envelope
modulation [48]. The two
durations chosen in current study correspond to different frequencies, e.g. 2.4 Hz
and 1.25 Hz, represent a common situation in music, however, covers a small
frequency range. That would limit the generalization of the conclusion to music with
much slower or faster rhythmic pattern which could be much more difficult to
memorize and thus possibly be influenced by the duration of notes. Nevertheless, the
lack of difference in two very different durations we tested shed interesting light
on how music might be processed by the brain.

Baddeley and colleagues observed that when the number of words in a sequence was
fixed, the length of words was negatively correlated with participants’ performance
[21]. The average
articulation time difference in the study was between 150ms and 480ms with the
average at 310ms. The duration difference between the quarter and eighth notes in
the current study is 400ms, which is greater than the articulation time difference
that has been shown to significantly influence the WM capacity for verbal words,
however caused no significant difference on the WM performance. One possibility
might be that the memory of tonal sequences relies less on sub-vocal rehearsal of
individual notes than that of enunciable verbal syllables, but more influenced by
the organization of notes that follow certain music grammar to form a contour of
pitch variation. Therefore, the tonal WM is less influenced by the duration of notes
but more determined by the number of notes.

The memory capacity limit is not a directly measurable quantity and can only be
inferred by psychophysical experiments. The tonal discrimination task in Experiment
1 tests the immediate memory span by exposing a participant to a sequence of tonal
notes. Participants need to maintain the tone information of the first sequence in
order to judge if one of the tones in the second sequence is different. The N-back
tonal task in Experiment 2, on the other hand, probes the running memory span by
requiring participants to memorize a subset of the notes in a tone sequence in
reverse order. Here we quantitatively measured the capacity of maintenance of tonal
information. As measured in Experiment 1, the maximum number of notes in a sequence
with the accuracy being above chance level is 16 for musical sequences (Fig 2E) and 8 (Fig 3E) for random sequences in
musicians, and 8 for both musical and random sequences in non-musicians. Tested in
Experiment 2, the maximum number of notes that musicians could effectively online
process is 5, and non-musicians could only manipulate 2 notes at a time. The present
study provides quantitative evidence supporting the notion that the number but not
the duration of note or sequence, defines the capacity limit of tonal WM, no matter
how much cognitive load involves in the process and independent of musical training
experience. The current findings are consistent with prior work showing that the
number of items defines the capacity limit of tonal WM [25] and vision WM [49]. Our results extend the understanding of
the difference between verbal and tonal WM, provide a piece of supporting evidence
of two independent mechanisms underlying verbal and tonal WM.

Since improving the ability of tonal information processing is one of the important
goals of musical training, it’s reasonable to expect the musical training would
significantly increase the capacity of tonal WM. In addition, the structure of note
sequences would also be one of candidate factors that crucially influences tonal WM
performance. Not surprising, the present study revealed the significant differences
between musicians and non-musicians regarding the maximum number of notes that could
be maintained and manipulated at a time. Using different categories of non-verbal
sounds as the testing materials, Li et al. showed that the maximal number of sounds
whose orders could be correctly recognized was slightly above three [25], in line with the range of
our finding, i.e. 5 tones for musicians and 2 tones for non-musicians. Our findings
are generally consistent with the previous finding by Halpern and Bower [40], which showed that
musicians remembered musical sequences better than non-musicians. Some studies have
suggested that musicians showed better performance in simple but not complex verbal
WM tasks, say forward vs. backward verbal digit span task [50–52]. In the current work, we found that for
tonal WM, musicians’ superiority existed regardless of task difficulty level. The
enhanced tonal WM exhibited by the musicians likely resulted from long-term musical
training. Although such long-term musical training produced enhancement could also
be caused by better strategies of musical memory in musicians, such as integrating
more notes or different features into single memory units as suggested by findings
in visual WM literature [49].
Interestingly, however, musicians did not show better performance with the random
tone sequences comparing with non-musicians (Fig 3E). One of the reasons contribute to this
result might be the contour complexity difference between the MTs and RTs in which
the former has relatively simpler contour whereas the latter has random contours.
Musical training produced better musical skills exhibit more often in musical
context where the contour of pitch variation remains relatively simple and agrees
with musical grammar. Such a superior performance would less likely exhibit with
note sequences that has random contour that do not form clear tonal structures.

It is reasonable to consider that one strategy to memorize and recall a tone sequence
is by grouping a few notes together. In the tonal discrimination task (Experiment
1), the participants need to maintain the notes and the temporal order of the
presented notes in their WM system in order to correctly perform the task. Although
the musicians did not outperform non-musicians in the RTS condition (Fig 3E), their performance was
significantly better in the N-back task. When adjacent notes were used as the probe
notes, the musicians’ performance was significantly influenced, but not
non-musicians’ performance (Fig
5A). It may due to the musical training that gave the musicians a better
ability to group the notes that even not explicitly follow musical conventional
structures. The results agree with Oberauer’s argument of binding processes being
involved in order to successfully perform the N-back tonal task, suggesting that the
influence of musical training on tonal WM not only exists in the musical context
[53]. Our study suggests
that the N-back tonal task might be a better method for evaluating the ability of
tonal information processing in working memory.

The N-back task has been used to evaluate some other cognitive processes such as the
conflicting processes between familiarity and recollection [53,54]. For example, if a current stimulus matches
a previous stimulus but not the one N items previously presented in the sequence,
the ability of resolving the conflict is required to perform the task, including
inhibition and interference resolution [55]. Interestingly, our results show that the
conflict resolving process only influenced musicians’ but not non-musicians’ WM
performance. One explanation is that non-musicians’ performance was reaching a
ground poor that could not be harmed further by the conflict solving processes.
Another reason could be that only musicians established and maintained bindings
among notes contained in their WM system that would affect the manipulation of tonal
information. The enhanced tonal WM that we observed in musicians could also be
caused by more efficient perceptual learning by musicians when exposed to the
testing stimuli or practicing the tasks, considering tonal perceptual learning has
previously been shown to be quite rapid [56]. However, the result of the analysis of the
task-related learning effect indicates that the superior performance in musicians
over non-musicians was not caused by short-term learning from doing the tasks (Fig 6).

The main finding of the present study is that the number of notes but not the
duration of notes, determined the capacity of the maintenance and the manipulation
of tonal information measured with both forward and backward tasks in both musicians
and non-musicians. Tonal working memory is an important component of the auditory
working memory that differs from verbal working memory. However, its underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. It would be intriguing to compare the neural bases of
verbal and tonal WM using the same experimental paradigm, such as the backward
N-back task in the future. A recent imaging study by Kumar et al. (2016)
demonstrated the involvement of the hippocampus in encoding, maintenance, and
retrieval of tones in working memory, and the importance of the activity in the
auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus for the maintenance of tone in working
memory [57]. Kumar et al.
(2016) study suggested that the long-range connectivity of the three brain areas may
be responsible for keeping the representations of tone information active during
working memory maintenance [57]. Future imaging and behavioral studies may identify brain areas that
are specifically involved in tonal or verbal working memory processes.
