Correction to: Nature Communications 10.1038/s41467-018-03247-3; published online 26 February 2018

In the original version of this Article, the affiliation details for Qiushuo Shen incorrectly omitted ‘Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650204, China’. This has now been corrected in both the PDF and HTML versions of the Article.
