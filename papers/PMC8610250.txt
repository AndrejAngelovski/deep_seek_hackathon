Despite recent advances in understanding how respiration affects neural signalling to influence perception, cognition, and behaviour, it is yet unclear to what extent breathing modulates brain oscillations at rest. We acquired respiration and resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from human participants to investigate if, where, and how respiration cyclically modulates oscillatory amplitudes (2 to 150 Hz). Using measures of phase–amplitude coupling, we show respiration-modulated brain oscillations (RMBOs) across all major frequency bands. Sources of these modulations spanned a widespread network of cortical and subcortical brain areas with distinct spectrotemporal modulation profiles. Globally, delta and gamma band modulations varied with distance to the head centre, with stronger modulations at distal (versus central) cortical sites. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive mapping of RMBOs across the entire brain, highlighting respiration–brain coupling as a fundamental mechanism to shape neural processing within canonical resting state and respiratory control networks (RCNs).

Despite recent advances, it remains unclear to what extent breathing modulates brain oscillations at rest. This magnetoencephalography study in human participants identifies a widespread brain network of neural oscillations that are coupled to the respiratory rhythm.

pmcIntroduction

We all breathe. Human respiration at rest comes naturally and comprises active (but automatic) inspiration and passive expiration [1]. The rhythmicity of each breath is initiated and coordinated by coupled oscillators periodically driving respiration, most prominently the preBötzinger complex located in the medulla [2]. This microcircuit typically controls respiration autonomously, making the act of breathing seem effortless. Importantly, however, respiration is also under top-down control, as evident from adaptive breathing during, e.g., speaking, laughing, and crying [3]. Hence, there is a bidirectional interplay of the cortex and rhythmic pattern generators of respiration: Efferent respiratory signals from the preBötzinger complex project to suprapontine nuclei (via locus coeruleus and olfactory nuclei [4]) as well as to the central medial thalamus, which is directly connected to limbic and sensorimotor cortical areas [5]. In turn, cortical areas evoke changes in the primary respiratory network, e.g., to initiate specific motor acts (e.g., swallowing or singing) or transitions between brain states (e.g., during panic attacks).

As neural oscillations have been established as sensitive markers of brain states in general [6], the question arises to what extent rhythmic brain activity is modulated by the rhythmic act of breathing. Indeed, studies of respiration–brain coupling have recently attracted increased attention, reporting a range of cognitive and motor processes to be influenced by respiration phase. Human participants were found to spontaneously inhale at onsets of cognitive tasks [7] and respiration phase modulated neural responses in sensory [8] and face processing [9] tasks as well as during oculomotor control [10] and isometric contraction [11]. Parallel to this body of work, animal studies have conclusively shown respiration to entrain brain oscillations not only in olfactory regions [12], but also in rodent whisker barrel cortex [13] and even hippocampus [14]. In other words, brain rhythms previously attributed to cognitive processes such as memory were demonstrated to at least in part reflect processes closely linked to respiration [15].

Despite significant advances in the animal literature, these links are still critically understudied in humans. Notable exceptions include intracranial EEG (iEEG) work in epilepsy patients corroborating that oscillations at various frequencies can be locked to the respiration cycle even in nonolfactory brain regions [9]. Moreover, 2 noninvasive studies recently linked respiration phase to changes in task-related oscillatory activity [7]. Overall, both animal and human studies all lead to 3 fundamental questions that recognise respiration as a vital, continuous rhythm persisting during all tasks and activities as well as at rest: (i) to what extent does breathing modulate rhythmic brain oscillations at rest; (ii) where are these modulatory effects localised in the brain; and (iii) how does modulation unfold over the course of the respiration cycle. Therefore, what is needed is a comprehensive account integrating recent findings of respiration–brain coupling against the anatomical backdrop of canonical resting state and respiratory control networks (RCNs). A variety of neural networks have extensively been described to organise the brain’s intrinsic or ongoing activity, among which the default mode network (DMN), the dorsal attention network (DAN), and the salience network (SN) have received particular attention [16]. Previous studies have demonstrated intriguing anticorrelated dynamics of activity between these large-scale networks (i.e., increases in one network lead to decreases in another [17]). Such fluctuating relationships between cortical networks could conceivably be modulated by changes in bodily states such as respiration. The full picture is complemented by 2 distinct pathways responsible for the feedforward generation of the respiratory rhythm and the neural processing of respiration-related signals, respectively: In addition to pattern generators like the preBötzinger complex in the medulla, deeper sites known to be involved in respiratory control comprise further subregions within the brain stem [18] and cerebellar nuclei [19]. On the other hand, nasal respiration evokes feedback signalling in response to mechanical, thermal, or odour stimulation within olfactory areas in the forebrain, most prominently the olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex [12]. These (orbito-)frontal feedback signals are a central contributor for respiration–brain coupling, as animal studies have demonstrated that respiratory rhythms (i.e., air-driven mechanoreceptor signals within the OB) are translated into neural oscillations and propagated to upstream areas [13]. Interestingly, the RCN also includes directly connected cortical sites like primary and supplementary motor areas (SMAs) [20] and even shows anatomical overlap with resting state networks, namely within medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [21], insula [22], and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [23]. We thus aimed to investigate respiration-related modulations of oscillatory brain activity and its spectrotemporal characteristics at rest, relating their anatomical sources to canonical networks of both resting state activity and respiratory control.

To this end, we simultaneously recorded spontaneous respiration and eyes-open resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from healthy human participants. Using the modulation index (MI) as a measure of cross-frequency phase–amplitude coupling [24], we first assessed respiration-induced modulation of brain oscillations globally across the entire brain. We then extracted single-voxel time series to localise the anatomical sources of these global modulation effects using beamforming (Fig 1A). We employed nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF) for dimensionality reduction, effectively yielding a spatially constrained network of cortical and subcortical sources of respiration phase–dependent changes in rhythmic brain activity. Finally, we identified distinct spectrotemporal profiles of network components, highlighting an intriguing organisational pattern behind respiration-induced modulation of neural oscillations across the brain.

Global field power was computed on the time course of all 268 channels for further analyses of the MI and PTA. MI quantifies to what extent the amplitude envelopes of frequency-specific brain oscillations (top right, red) were modulated by respiration (centre right, blue). This way, we computed modulation indices for each sensor, frequency, and participant before localising voxelwise time series in source space (see Fig 2).

(C) Mean PTAs across the respiratory cycle over the entire frequency spectrum. PTAs were computed by averaging frequency-specific amplitude envelopes (panel A) time locked to peak inhalation. Note that PTAs were standardised for illustration purposes. Therefore, they show relative changes over the respiration cycle within each frequency band and do not directly correspond to absolute MI amplitudes from panel B. Also note that SNR decreases towards the edges of the panel (i.e., approaching ± π) due to increased variation of underlying single respiratory cycles that were used for phase-locked analysis.

Results

Respiration phase modulates global field power

To assess the fundamental question of whether respiration modulates oscillatory brain activity at rest, we first computed the MI in sensor space (using all 268 channels) for whole-brain global field power ranging from 2 to 150 Hz. This analysis quantifies to what extent the amplitude of global brain oscillations is modulated by the phase of respiration. Our cluster permutation analysis revealed significant respiration-locked modulation of global field power indicated by the high normalised MI across the entire frequency spectrum (all p < 0.001, cluster corrected at α = 0.05; see Fig 1B). Local peaks with strongest modulation occurred at about 2, 30, 75, and 130 Hz (with strongest absolute modulation effects in the beta band), indicating differential modulation of specific brain oscillations (see S1 Fig for range and distribution of subject-level MI spectra). Next, we computed the phase-triggered average (PTA) to characterise these global modulation effects over a respiratory cycle. PTA is computed as the average of oscillatory amplitude across windows centred on all time points of peak inhalation. We found respiration phase to differentially modulate oscillations of various frequencies with distinct time courses. In particular, whereas most frequency bands showed strongest modulation effects around the inspiration peak, beta oscillations were visibly coupled to a different phase of respiration around inspiration onset (Fig 1C; see S2 Fig for subject-level PTA spectrograms).

This first analysis therefore revealed that the amplitude of global oscillatory brain activity was significantly modulated by respiration in a broad frequency range from 2 to 150 Hz with a temporal modulation that differs across frequencies. To gain a deeper understanding of how respiration modulates rhythmic activity across the brain, 2 questions immediately ensued, namely to localise the anatomical sources of such modulation effects and to explore their spectrotemporal profiles in more detail.

Modulatory effects of respiration phase can be traced to cortical and subcortical networks

To identify the anatomical sources of these global modulations, we quantified how strongly respiration modulated the amplitude of brain oscillations within each voxel in the brain of each participant at each frequency between 2 and 150 Hz by computing the MI. Next, we used sparse NMF to reduce the dimensionality of the three-dimensional data set (participants × voxels × frequency; see Materials and methods). This resulted in an optimal low-dimensional representation consisting of 18 components. Each component reflected respiration-modulated brain oscillations (RMBOs) across the frequency spectrum, quantified as NMF weights for each participant, voxel, and frequency. For spatial specificity of NMF components, each component’s spatial map was thresholded at the 99th percentile, yielding the n = 202 voxels with the strongest modulation. For all 18 components, we show the spatial location of the network on an inflated brain as well as the full MI spectrum with shading corresponding to frequency bands of significant modulation (all p < 0.002, cluster corrected across frequencies and components at α = 0.05; see Fig 2). For individual spatial maps for all 18 components, see S3 and S4 Figs. Phase-dependent modulations of all 18 components are shown in S5 Fig. Together, this provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal spectral account of respiration-modulated networks in the resting brain.

Spatial maps were thresholded at the 99th percentile across all 20,173 voxels of each component, yielding the n = 202 voxels with the strongest modulation. Colour bar indicates corresponding p-values. (B) Subcortical components plotted on transverse and sagittal slices of the MNI brain. Same format as A.

Fig 2A shows the network’s cortical sources to be localised along the midline (ACC, SMA, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), cuneus, and lingual sulcus) as well as in lateralised frontal (frontal eye field (FEF) and insula), temporal, and parietal cortices (angular gyrus and intraparietal sulcus (IPS)). The network’s deeper, subcortical sites included several lateralised (crus 1, lobules 7b/8) and midline (vermis 9/10) subsections within the cerebellum, left parahippocampal cortex, and medial sources in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; extending onto the gyrus rectus) and brain stem (Fig 2B). In order to quantify modulation effects between components, we compared each component’s MI at a given frequency with the average MI across all other components. Components #3 and #14 (both located within the left cerebellum) showed above average modulation in the high gamma band, whereas components #6 (r. STG/r. temporal pole) and #11 (brain stem) were more strongly modulated in the delta and alpha band, respectively. Component #10 (bil. SMA) showed above average modulation in the beta and low gamma range. Finally, component #12 (bil. ACC) was less strongly modulated at low gamma frequencies than the grand average across components (see S6 Fig).

These results provide several important insights. First, respiration significantly modulates oscillatory brain activity within a specific, but widely distributed cortical and subcortical brain network. Second, across these areas, significant RMBOs can be found across almost the entire frequency range from 2 to 150 Hz. Third, the temporal modulation pattern of RMBOs is by no means uniform across frequencies and brain areas.

Distinct spectrotemporal profiles of RMBO sites

Having localised the anatomical network underlying RMBOs, we next attempted to map distinct modulation patterns to anatomical subnetworks, with similarly modulated sites being grouped together. To this end, we employed hierarchical clustering of all 18 network components based on their MI across the frequency spectrum (as shown in Fig 2). This data-driven approach yielded a total of 7 clusters comprising between 1 and 5 components (Fig 3; see S7 Fig and Materials and methods for details): Cluster A consisted of a single component within the left insular cortex/OFC and showed significant modulation across all frequency bands except the delta band. Cluster B showed a clear cortical organisation along the midline, comprising bilateral PCC and SMA components with significant modulation from theta up to high gamma oscillations. Similarly, cluster C comprised 2 components within bilateral ACC and right FEF with significant modulation from alpha up to high gamma oscillations. Cluster D was formed by a total of 6 components spanning inferior, medial, and superior temporal gyrus (ITG, MTG, and STG), parietal cortices (anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS)/temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and angular gyrus) as well as deep cerebellar areas showing RMBOs. Due to its widespread topography, at least 1 cluster component showed significant modulation across the entire frequency spectrum. Cluster E again consisted of a single component (spanning bilateral (pre-)cuneus/lingual sulcus) with significant modulation in the theta, beta, and both gamma bands. Finally, 2 clusters were formed exclusively by deep sources: Cluster F comprised 2 components within the left cerebellum where oscillations across the whole frequency spectrum were significantly modulated by respiration. Cluster G consisted of 4 components within the left parahippocampal cortex, brain stem, cerebellum, and gyrus rectus/medial OFC and showed significant modulation from theta up to the high gamma band.

Polar plots show cluster-average RMBOs (colour coded for frequency; see top left) as a function of respiration phase (where zero corresponds to the peak of the respiration signal).

Underlying data are provided in the folder ‘Fig 3’ on the OSF directory. exp, expiration; insp, inspiration; RMBO, respiration-modulated brain oscillation.

In order to investigate how MI spectra varied with anatomical location, we conducted a linear mixed effect model (LMEM) analysis modelling oscillatory modulations as a function of components’ distance to the head centre (considering x, y, and z planes). This analysis revealed that the fixed effect of distance to the head centre significantly influenced modulations within the delta (t(502) = 3.55, p < 0.001) as well as the low (t(502) = 2.49, p = 0.013) and high gamma bands (t(502) = 3.85, p < 0.001), with stronger modulations for more distal (compared to central) components. Further, frequency-specific analyses were conducted to characterise to what extent this overall distance effect was driven by sagittal, frontal, and transversal location, respectively (see S1 Text and S1 Table for details).

Intriguingly, not only were different frequency bands modulated within a network of cortical and subcortical sites, but the time courses of these modulatory effects were equally frequency specific. Polar plots in Fig 3 show the temporal modulation of RMBOs across the respiratory cycle for each cluster. Respiration phase was differentially coupled with amplitudes of low-frequency oscillations (such as delta and theta) compared to high-frequency oscillations (e.g., within the gamma band). Low frequencies consistently showed higher amplitudes during the beginning and end of a respiration cycle (with lowest amplitudes around peak inspiration), whereas the pattern appeared reversed for higher frequencies (see Fig 3). While specific spatiotemporal interactions of respiration–brain coupling exceeded the conceptual scope of this study, our findings are the first to suggest such spatiospectral gradients and thus warrant detailed examination in future work.

RMBOs within nodes of resting state and RCNs

Extending the distinction of deep versus more superficial components, cortical RMBOs were predominantly found in brain areas that have previously been established as nodes within the DMN (PCC, angular gyrus, and precuneus), DAN (FEF and aIPS), or saliency network (SN: insula and ACC; see [15]). Moreover, all deep and cerebellar modulation sites corresponded to a mostly subcortical network of brain areas controlling respiratory function, including bilateral cerebellum, gyrus rectus/OFC, brain stem, and SMA (Fig 4C). Finally, as a potential link for future studies, Fig 4D appears to suggest that, although RMBOs of different frequencies had distinct temporal modulation profiles in general, there could also be certain sequential modulation patterns across clusters within a particular frequency. For example, while significant modulation of beta oscillations showed a general peak around expiration onset (distinct from e.g., high gamma modulation), this peak appeared to occur earlier and less pronounced in cluster B (PCC and SMA) than in cluster D (cerebellum and temporoparietal cortex). Future work could aim to verify such latency effects between nodes of the RMBO network and their potential functional significance. At present, our results provide a unique perspective on the general link between respiration phase and changes in oscillatory activity, showing how the sources of these modulatory effects correspond to nodes of canonical networks in control of resting state activity and respiratory function.

Discussion

Using noninvasive MEG recordings of human participants at rest, we performed the first spatially and spectrally comprehensive analysis of brain activity that is modulated by respiration. We identified RMBOs across the entire spectrum between 2 and 150 Hz within a widespread network of cortical and subcortical brain areas. The voxel-based analysis employed adaptive beamforming for source localisation. Adaptive beamforming optimally combines MEG recordings from all sensors to estimate the time series of neural activation at a given voxel while maximally suppressing interferences from other voxels. Although spatial resolution decreases with distance from sensors, it is generally suitable for cortical and subcortical areas. Intriguingly, instead of a uniform modulation pattern across brain areas and frequencies, our analysis revealed respiratory modulation signatures that differed between brain areas in frequency and the temporal modulation profile. Our results demonstrate that respiration significantly modulates oscillatory brain activity in a manner that is precisely orchestrated across frequency bands and networks of resting state activity and respiratory control. In what follows, we will integrate our novel results with the existing animal and human literature, characterise the functionality of neural oscillations within distinct networks, and attempt to provide an overview of potential multilevel mechanisms behind RMBOs.

Subcortical and cortical sites of respiration–brain coupling

Gamma oscillations within the OB were the first to be described in detail [25] and reflect local computations within the OB [26]. In a next step, slower (e.g., beta band) oscillations are thought to organise such local activity across brain areas [27] and appear to be the most coherent within the OB [28]. Similarly, even slower theta oscillations play a crucial role in the temporal organisation of neural activity within the hippocampal network and, consequently, its coordination with the mPFC [29]. Our findings substantially advance these notions by showing that respiration phase modulates both low and high oscillatory frequencies within a spatial array comprising OB/OFC, brain stem, and cerebellum. As described earlier, the preBötzinger complex is widely regarded as the main pattern generator of respiratory rhythms within the brain stem [4], where ascending catecholaminergic neurons receive projections from the cerebellar vermis [30]. In addition to brain stem projections, the vermis regulates autonomic responses including cardiovascular tone and respiration through connections to the spinal cord and hypothalamus [31]. These cerebellothalamic pathways affect cortical gamma activity, in that cerebellar projections to the “motor” ventral anterior lateral (VAL) nucleus of the thalamus, the (higher order) posterior thalamic nucleus (VP), and intralaminar nuclei are used to coordinate and synchronise gamma oscillations within sensorimotor areas [32] and across the neocortex [33].

The cerebellum itself projects to motor and nonmotor cortical areas, including prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex [34]. In turn, it receives input from a wide range of higher-order, nonmotor areas within the extrastriate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, cingulate cortex, and the parahippocampal gyrus, which is monosynaptically connected to the OB [35]. As the first olfactory relay station in the brain, the OB receives direct projections from receptors within the nasal cavity [36]. These feedback signals not only encode odour information in olfactory receptor cells [37], but also mechanical stimulation of mechanoreceptors triggered by nasal airflow [38]. As outlined above, subsequent neural activity patterns are then transmitted to upstream sites including OFC, hippocampus, and insula, which we fittingly found to be part of the RMBO network.

In sum, our findings integrate and extend a variety of individual results in 2 ways: First, cortical nodes within the RMBO network precisely reflect bidirectional projection areas of the deep and subcortical nodes (OB, brain stem, and cerebellum) via medullar and thalamic pathways. Second, the cortical nodes markedly resemble “sensorimotor distributions” shown in multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of respiratory control [39], raising the question as to how different cortical areas—motor areas, ACC, and insular cortex—are involved in the act of breathing. As both premotor and supplementary motor cortices contain representations of respiratory muscles [40], they have long been implicated in respiratory control. Similarly, ACC has been identified in studies of air hunger [23] and CO2-stimulated breathing. Finally, insular cortex activation is a consistent feature of many neuroimaging studies of dyspnoea [22]. The close mapping of frontal, cingulate, and parietal areas to canonical resting state networks (see Fig 4) suggests a general involvement of respiration in human brain processing irrespective of particular task demands. In this context, it is noteworthy that nodes of resting state networks exhibit amplitude correlations predominantly in the beta frequency band [41]. In our data, this frequency band shows strongest global modulation by respiration (Fig 1B) and features prominently in the coupling of specific resting state networks to respiration (Figs 3 and 4), suggesting that these amplitude correlations within resting state networks are at least partially related to respiration.

Active sensing, respiration, and behaviour

The widespread extent and spectral diversity of the RMBO network critically corroborate previous suggestions of respiration as an overarching “clock” mechanism organising neural excitability throughout the brain [13]. Excitability adapts neural responses to current behavioural demands, which is why respiratory adaptation to such demands in animals [42] and humans [43] have accordingly been interpreted as functional body–brain coupling. Indeed, animals as well as humans appear to actively align their breathing to time points of particular behavioural relevance for the sake of efficiency through optimised neural processing. Consequently, human respiration has fittingly been cast as active sensing [44], adopting key premises from predictive brain processing accounts [45] to explain how respiration synchronises time frames of increased cortical excitability with the sampling of sensory information. Our results provide first insights into how established mechanisms like cross-frequency phase–amplitude coupling (in this case, coupling peripheral to neural rhythms) are implemented on a global scale to translate respiratory rhythms into neural oscillations of various frequencies and how the resulting anatomical pattern of RMBOs reflects spectral specificity.

Potential mechanisms behind RMBOs

Cross-frequency coupling is widely regarded as the core mechanism of translating slow rhythms into faster oscillations and has conclusively been shown to be driven by respiratory rhythms within the OB in mice [13]: During nasal inspiration, air enters the respiratory tract and triggers mechanoreceptors connected to the OB, thereby initiating infraslow neural oscillations closely following the respiratory rhythm (phase–phase coupling). The phase of these slow oscillations then drives the amplitude of faster oscillations (phase–amplitude coupling) and propagates to upstream areas both within and beyond the olfactory system [46]. With reference to the concept of active sensing introduced above, we argue that a similar case can be made for the cerebellum: There is broad consensus that the cerebellum is involved in computations attributed to internal forward models, predominantly in motor control [47]. These forward models are just as crucial for perception and cognition as they are for motor performance, leading to the suggestion that cerebellar processing may help to align and adaptively modify cognitive representations for skilled and error-free cognitive performance [34]. The prominent role of cerebellar sources in our present findings suggests that respiration modulates these functional connections by means of cross-frequency coupling, linking respiration to motor and cognitive function.

Strong support for this hypothesis comes from a recent study [48] showing that the cortical readiness potential, originating within premotor areas, fluctuates with respiration. Notably, the authors suggest cross-frequency coupling to involve neural interactions between premotor areas and both insular and cingulate cortex as well as the medulla, which is precisely the pathway we propose to connect deep and cortical nodes within the RMBO network. A simple graph model of excitatory and inhibitory cells has been shown as proof of principle for cortical gamma modulation through respiration (modelled as sinusoidal input) [49]. The authors later concluded that respiration-locked brain activity has 2 driving sources [50]: On the one hand, respiration entrains OB activity via mechanoreceptors, as seen in local field potentials [25]. On the other hand, Heck and colleagues propose extrabulbar sources within the brain stem, which are of critical importance for the generation of the respiratory rhythm itself. Functionally, respiration thus appears to modulate higher oscillatory frequencies (e.g., gamma) for the purpose of integrating locally generated assemblies across the brain [51]. Our data now show that respiration–brain coupling (i) spans an even more extensive network including deep cerebellothalamic pathways; and (ii) involves a wider variety of oscillatory modulation than previously assumed. Importantly, our analyses demonstrate that the spectral specificity of respiration-related modulations within the RMBO network cannot be explained by mere changes in CO2 alone (see S3 Text).

While the RMBO network presented here provides the most comprehensive account of human respiration–brain coupling to date, central research questions emerge as objectives for future work. First, having established the sources of respiration-related changes to neural oscillations, the transition from resting state to task context will illuminate the relevance of RMBOs for behaviour. Cognitive, perceptive, and motor performance have been shown to be modulated by respiration, warranting a closer assessment of the where (i.e., which site) and when (i.e., at which phase) of task-related RMBOs. Second, we have outlined functional pathways connecting the cerebellum to cerebral cortex via medullar and thalamic projections as well as the close link between OB and parahippocampal as well as prefrontal cortices. These putative hierarchies should be tested with directional measures of functional connectivity in order to reveal organisational relations within the RMBO network. Similarly, directed connectivity analysis can disambiguate bottom-up from top-down signals within the wider RMBO network and potentially illuminate the notably lateralised effects within it: Although lateralisation is not uncommon in well-established functional networks (e.g., related to attention; see [52]), it will be instructive for future work to validate whether RMBOs reliably prove stronger in one hemisphere (as was the case for insula and FEF) or whether there is a separate dynamic underlying the involvement of individual nodes.

In summary, our comprehensive investigation of respiration–brain coupling emphasises respiration as a powerful predictor for amplitude modulations of rhythmic brain activity across diverse brain networks. These modulations are mediated by cross-frequency coupling (linking respiratory to neural rhythms) and encompass all major frequency bands that are thought to differentially support cognitive brain functions. Furthermore, respiration–brain coupling extends beyond the core RCN to well-known resting-state networks such as default mode and attention networks. Our findings therefore identify respiration–brain coupling as a pervasive phenomenon and underline the fact that body and brain functions are intimately linked and, together, shape cognition.

Materials and methods

Participants

A total of 28 volunteers (14 female, age 24.8 ± 2.87 years [mean ± SD]) participated in the study. All participants denied having any respiratory or neurological disease and gave written informed consent prior to all experimental procedures. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Muenster (approval ID 2018-068-f-S) and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Procedure

Participants were seated upright in a magnetically shielded room while we simultaneously recorded respiration and MEG data. MEG data were acquired using a 275 channel whole-head system (OMEGA 275, VSM Medtech, Vancouver, Canada) and continuously recorded at a sampling frequency of 600 Hz. During recording, participants were to keep their eyes on a fixation cross centred on a projector screen placed in front of them. To minimise head movement, the participant’s head was stabilised with cotton pads inside the MEG helmet.

Data were acquired in 2 runs of 5-minute duration with an intermediate self-paced break. Participants were to breathe automatically through their nose while tidal volume was measured as thoracic circumference by means of a respiration belt transducer (BIOPAC Systems, Goleta, United States of America) placed around their chest. Continuous monitoring via video ensured participants were breathing through their nose instead of their mouth. Individual respiration time courses were visually inspected for irregular breathing patterns such as breath holds or unusual breathing frequencies, but no artefacts were detected.

For MEG source localisation, we obtained high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in a 3T Magnetom Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Anatomical images were acquired using a standard Siemens 3D T1-weighted whole brain MPRAGE imaging sequence (1 × 1 × 1 mm voxel size, TR = 2,130 ms, TE = 3.51 ms, 256 × 256 mm field of view, 192 sagittal slices). MRI measurement was conducted in supine position to reduce head movements, and gadolinium markers were placed at the nasion as well as left and right distal outer ear canal positions for landmark-based co-registration of MEG and MRI coordinate systems. Data preprocessing was performed using Fieldtrip [53] running in MATLAB R2018b (The Mathworks, Natick, USA). Individual raw MEG data were visually inspected for jump artefacts and bad channels, but neither were detected. Both MEG and respiration data were resampled to 300 Hz prior to further analyses.

MRI co-registration

Co-registration of structural MRIs to the MEG coordinate system was done individually by initial identification of 3 anatomical landmarks (nasion, left and right pre-auricular points) in the participant’s MRI. Using the implemented segmentation algorithms in Fieldtrip and SPM12, individual head models were constructed from anatomical MRIs. A solution of the forward model was computed using the realistically shaped single-shell volume conductor model [54] with a 5-mm grid defined in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template brain (MNI, Montreal, Canada) after linear transformation to the individual MRI.

Computation of global field power

For the computation of global field power, the time courses of each channel of each participant were individually subjected to a continuous wavelet transform using a Morlet wavelet for 36 frequencies (from 2 Hz to 20 Hz in steps of 2 Hz and then in steps of 5 Hz up to 150 Hz). Next, we computed the absolute value of this complex-valued data and averaged these amplitude values across channels.

Head movement correction

Based on previous respiration-related work from our lab [11], it was reasonable to assume that there would be respiration-induced changes in head position and/or rotation. Therefore, we computed individual Spearman correlations between the normalised respiration time course and head movement traces of translation and rotation (in x, y, and z direction, respectively) using the accurate online head movement tracking that is performed by our acquisition system during MEG recordings. Correlation coefficients were Fisher z-transformed and averaged across runs (for each participant) and across participants to yield group-level average correlation coefficients for all 6 head movement time courses. A series of t tests revealed significant correlations between the respiration signal and translation in the x plane (ρ [27] = −0.16, t [27] = −10.31, p < 0.001) as well as rotation in both x plane (ρ [27] = −0.16, t [27] = −10.99, p < 0.001) and z plane (ρ [27] = 0.16, t [27] = 11.08, p < 0.001; all p-values corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni–Holm method). S10 Fig shows head movement traces (translation and rotation) phase locked to respiration.

As some correlation between respiration and head movement was to be expected, it was critical to rule out that our results were confounded by these head movements. To this end, we used a correction method established by Stolk and colleagues [55]. This method again used the head movement tracking information (described above), i.e., 6 continuous signals (temporally aligned to the MEG signal) that represent the x, y, and z coordinates of the head centre (Hx, Hy, and Hz) and the 3 rotation angles (Hψ, Hϑ, and Hφ) that together fully describe the head movement. We constructed a regression model comprising these 6 “raw” signals as well as their derivatives and, from these 12 signals, the first-, second-, and third-order nonlinear regressors to compute a total of 36 head movement-related regression weights (using a third-order polynomial fit to remove slow drifts). This regression analysis was performed on the power spectra of single-sensor (and single-voxel) time courses for analyses in sensor and source space, respectively, removing signal components that can be explained by translation or rotation of the head with respect to the MEG sensors.

In addition to controlling potential artefacts caused by head movement, we report a related control analysis for high-frequency muscle artefacts in S2 Text.

Computation of MI and PTA

The MI quantifies cross-frequency coupling and specifically phase–amplitude coupling [24]. Here, it was used to study to what extent the amplitude of brain oscillations at different frequencies is modulated by the phase of respiration. To this end, the instantaneous phase of the respiration time course was computed with the Hilbert transform. Next, the time series at each sensor location were sequentially subjected to a continuous Morlet wavelet transformation at frequencies ranging from 2 to 150 Hz (with 2 Hz spacing below 20 Hz and 5 Hz spacing above 20 Hz) using the cwtft function in MATLAB with default settings. This function computes a continuous Morlet wavelet transform using a Fourier transform-based algorithm. The Fourier transform of our wavelet is defined as Ψ(f)=π−14e−(f−f0)22H(f), (1)

where H(f) is the Heaviside function, and f0 is the centre frequency in radians/sample. We then computed the amplitude envelope and smoothed it with a 300-ms moving average. MI computation was then based on the average amplitude at 20 different phases of the respiratory cycle. Any significant modulation (i.e., deviation from a uniform distribution) is quantified by the entropy of this distribution. To account for frequency-dependent biases, we followed previously validated approaches [9, 56] and computed 200 surrogate MIs using random shifts of respiratory phase time series with concatenation across the edges. The normalised MI was computed by subtracting, for each frequency, the mean of all surrogate MIs and dividing by their standard deviation leading to MI values in units of standard deviation of the surrogate distribution (see Fig 1B). Visual inspection confirmed that this removed the frequency bias in raw MI values (stronger MI for low frequencies compared to high frequencies). The computation resulted in normalised MI values for each channel, frequency, and participant. Following the established approach by Maris and colleagues [57], significance of these normalised MI values on the group level was determined by means of cluster-based permutation testing using ft_freqstatistics in Fieldtrip. This test controls for multiple testing and involves different steps. Specifically, we conducted a series of 1-tailed t tests of individual MI values at each frequency against the 95th percentile of the null distribution from the 200 surrogate MI values. t-Values were then thresholded at p = 0.05 and spectrally adjacent significant data points were defined as clusters. For each cluster, we then defined the cluster-level statistics as the sum of the t-values within every cluster. Each cluster was then tested for significance using Monte Carlo approximation. For this approximation, single subject MI spectra were randomly interchanged with the previously used 95th percentile spectra, and the t test was recomputed followed by clustering and computation of the cluster-level summed t-values. After repeating the randomisation procedure 5,000 times, the original cluster statistics were compared to the histogram of the randomised null statistics. Clusters in the original data were deemed significant when they yielded a larger test statistic than 95% of the randomised null data.

To assess oscillatory modulation over time, the PTA was computed from the smoothed, band-specific amplitude envelopes averaged across all sensors. Time points of peak inhalation were detected from the respiration phase angle time series using MATLAB’s findpeaks function. For each time point of peak inhalation, global field power across all 36 frequencies was averaged within a time window of ± 1,000 samples centred around peak inhalation. The resulting 36 frequencies × 2,000 samples matrix was finally normalised across the time dimension, leading to z-scores of whole-head oscillatory power phase locked to the respiration signal. This analysis is equivalent to a wavelet-based time-frequency analysis. Computations were done separately for both MEG runs, normalised across the time domain, and finally averaged across runs and participants.

Extraction of time series in source space

Source reconstruction was performed using the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer approach [58], where the lambda regularisation parameter was set to 0%. This approach estimates a spatial filter for each location of the 5-mm grid along the direction yielding maximum power. A single broadband (2 to 150 Hz) LCMV beamformer was used to estimate the voxel-level activities across all frequencies.

Rank optimisation and NMF

In our efforts to anatomically localise respiration phase–dependent modulation effects, we employed a spatially sparse variant of NMF to reduce the high (voxelwise) dimensionality in our data. Sparse NMF allows us to describe modulation indices across the brain as a low-dimensional combination of locally constrained network components, each of which provides a spectral profile for each participant. NMF has previously been applied for topological analyses of M/EEG data during tasks [59], at rest [60], and in decoding approaches [61]. As the MI is inherently nonnegative and the interpretation of NMF output matrices is rather straightforward, nonnegative factorisation in general was well suited to meet our demands. The sparse factorisation approach in particular has 2 key advantages over a regular NMF approach: First, regarding network identification, the sparsity constraints are highly beneficial in obtaining spatially specific rather than broad topologies, which was central for the next steps of our analyses. Second, these spatially specific topologies greatly enhance the precision with which time × frequency modulation characteristics can be displayed within one network component—the more distant voxels are included, the more component-specific modulations are diluted. In order to balance baseline differences between participants in preparation of the NMF, MI matrices of all 28 participants (20,173 voxels × 36 frequencies) were first normalised by their standard deviation [59]. These matrices were then averaged across both runs to yield one average matrix per participant. Individual matrices were transposed and concatenated to form one group-level input matrix (1,008 [frequencies × participants] × 20,137 voxels) for the NMF. To determine the number of main components to be extracted from NMF, we used the choosingR MATLAB function [62] that chooses the optimal rank based on singular value decomposition. Specifically, the function extracts the singular values of a data matrix (in our case, participants’ normalised MI matrices; size 36 frequencies × 20,173 voxels) and computes the sum of all nonzero elements of its diagonal. The optimal rank is then determined as the number of singular values that accounts for 90% of all diagonal entries. Applying this procedure to participants’ individual normalised MI matrices (36 frequencies × 20,173 voxels) returned a dimensionality of 18 as the optimal desired number of network components for the subsequent NMF analysis.

Subsequently, we initialised the sparsenmfnnls algorithm from the NMF toolbox for MATLAB [63]. The algorithm factorises the concatenated input matrix X as X≈AY, (2)

with the nonnegative matrices A and Y aiming to minimise the following quantity: X−AYF2+ηAYF2+λ∑i=1Nyi12, (3)

where η and λ are sparsity parameters. As NMF solutions vary as a function of their random starting position, we repeated this procedure 100 times and selected the best sparse solution based on its residuals. Two matrices were generated as the output of this procedure: First, the basis matrix A (1,008 [frequencies × participants] × 18 components) represents the participant-specific spectral profile, effectively quantifying each participant’s relative contribution to the network components separately for each frequency. The basis matrix was reshaped to a 36 × 28 × 18 (frequencies × participants × network components) matrix for all further analyses. As the second NMF output, the coefficient matrix Y (18 components × 20,173 voxels) represents the spatial profile of the network components, quantifying each voxel’s relative contribution to the components.

Component-level statistical analyses

While most components represented a single focal location due to the sparsity constraints embedded in the NMF algorithm, 4 components comprised distinct subnetworks of 2 or 3 anatomical sites. Spatial maps of all 18 network components are shown in Fig 2. These maps were generated by thresholding full-brain maps (with a total of n = 20,173 voxels) at the 99th percentile, yielding spatially specific maps with an extent of n = 202 voxels. To determine the frequency range(s) for which the MI within a particular component was significant on the group level, we used the same cluster-based permutation approach described in detail in the section “Computation of MI and PTA.” Here, this approach was used on all components together to correct for multiple comparisons across all 36 frequencies and 18 components.

Modulation differences across NMF components

In order to compare modulation spectra across the RMBO network, we conducted a control analysis that compares frequency-specific effects across the 18 NMF components: For all components 1..n and each of the 36 frequencies used in our main analyses, we computed z-scores by comparing the MI value at frequency i of a given component j to the average MI value across the remaining 17 components: zi,j=μMIi,j−μMIi,1..n\jσMIi,1..n\j.

This yielded a matrix of 18 components × 36 frequencies quantifying the difference between each component’s MI spectrum relative to the grand average across all components. S10 Fig visualises this matrix thresholded at z = ± 2.33 (corresponding to p = 0.01). A component’s MI values were considered significantly different from the mean of all other components when the difference exceeded the critical z value. Components #3 and #14 (both located within the left cerebellum) showed greater than average modulation in the high gamma band, whereas components #6 (r. STG/r. temporal pole) and #11 (brain stem) were more strongly modulated in the delta and alpha band, respectively. Component #10 (bil. SMA) showed above average modulation in the beta and low gamma range. Finally, component #12 (bil. ACC) was less strongly modulated at low gamma frequencies than the grand average across components.

LMEMs

We employed LMEM to investigate the relationship between the spatial organisation and spectral characteristics within the network of modulated components. LMEM models a response variable (in our case, modulation indices within a particular frequency band) as a linear combination of fixed effects shared across the population (i.e., anatomical coordinates of network components) and participant-specific random effects (i.e., modulatory variation between participants). To assess potential links between spatial and spectral component properties, we first computed each component’s anatomical distance to the head centre as the vector norm of MNI coordinates in the x, y, and z plane: r=x2+y2+z2. (4)

We then specified an LMEM to predict modulation indices of a particular frequency band within each component as a function of its distance to the head centre: MIj=β0+(β1+S1j)*r+ej. (5)

For participant j, the MI is expressed as a combination of the intercept (β0), the fixed effect of the component’s distance to the head centre (β1), and an error term (ej ~ N(0,σ2)). We accounted for between-participant variation by specifying a random slope (S1j). An analogous approach was used to predict modulation indices within each component separately for each plane (see S1 Text and S1 Table).

Hierarchical clustering

Having localised the sources of global field power modulations within a constrained subset of anatomical sites, our next aim was to characterise these sources in terms of their spectrotemporal fingerprints. This way, we hoped to reveal systematic patterns of phase-locked oscillatory modulations over time and/or frequencies within the cortical and subcortical network. To this end, we first computed the group-level average matrix of modulation indices for 20,173 voxels × 36 frequencies × 20 time bins. We used the anatomical distribution of each network component (thresholded at the 99th percentile) to reduce this matrix to a component-specific spatial map and aggregated 36 single frequencies into frequency bands as follows: delta (2 to 4 Hz), theta (4 to 8 Hz), alpha (8 to 2 Hz), beta (12 to 30 Hz), low gamma (30 to 70 Hz), and high gamma (70 to 150 Hz). This yielded one matrix (6 frequency bands × 20 time bins) per network component, all of which were concatenated to construct a distance matrix for the hierarchical clustering using the hcluster function within the Icasso toolbox for MATLAB [64]. This data-driven approach was employed to detect similarities of and differences between network components with regard to how oscillatory activity was modulated over the course of a respiration cycle. Following the suggested approach [64], we used visual inspection of the dendrogram to evaluate the clustering solutions. Based on a local maximum of the resulting silhouette value distribution, we settled on a total of 7 clusters (see Fig 3). We computed the average course of modulation indices over frequency bands within each cluster based on z-transformed spectral profiles of the contributing network components (as described above).

Submission Version1
14 Jul 2021

Dear Dr Kluger,

Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Respiration modulates oscillatory neural network activity at rest" for consideration as a Research Article at PLOS Biology. Your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, by an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by four independent reviewers. You will note that reviewer 2, Jan Kujala, has revealed his identity.

The reviews of your manuscript are appended below. You will see that the reviewers find the work potentially interesting. However, based on their specific comments and following discussion with the Academic Editor, I regret that we cannot accept the current version of the manuscript for publication. We remain interested in your study and we would be willing to consider resubmission of a comprehensively revised version that thoroughly addresses all the reviewers' comments. We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript would be sent for further evaluation by the reviewers.

As you will see from their detailed comments, the reviewers have some mixed views on the study, suggesting that the comprehensive nature of the work is nice, but they also raise various concerns related to potential confounds to your existing conclusions and a need to expand the work to provide more causal and mechanistic insights. In particular, reviewers 2 and 3 argue that more work is needed to rule out a confounding CO2-dependent mechanism, and reviewer 3 also asks that you provide additional controls to help rule out head movement confounds. While we appreciate that addressing these potential confounds would require a fair bit of additional work, such data seem necessary to strengthen the existing conclusions. In addition, to ensure the overall advance is sufficient for PLOS Biology, the revision should include additional analyses of the existing data as raised by reviewer 1 (point on coherence analyses) and reviewer 2 (points 2 and 3), and to provide some new data to address how behavior alters these findings (reviewer 4).

Having discussed the reviews with the Academic Editor, we think these should be addressed as the reviewers have requested, with additional data and analyses. Given the extent of the necessary revisions and their uncertain outcome, and that we would not be prepared to move forward with the work in their absence, we would also understand if you rather chose to seek publication elsewhere at this stage.

We appreciate that our requests represent a great deal of extra work, and we are willing to relax our standard revision time to allow you six months to revise your manuscript.

Please email us (plosbiology@plos.org) if you have any questions or concerns, or would like to request an extension.

REVIEWS:

Reviewer #1: The manuscript by Kluger and Gross analyzes the effect of respiration on oscillatory brain activity in humans at rest. Using magnetencephalography in awake, resting subjects they provide evidence for widely distributed phase-amplitude coupling between respiration and different brain-intrinsic oscillations (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma). They further show that different frequency bands are differentially modulated at different locations, and that the identified networks have strong overlap with canonical networks, esp. the resting-state network.

The modulation of oscillatory brain activity by respiration has become a research focus during past years, resulting in a large body of literature from both, rodent and human studies. The observation that brain rhythms in humans are modulated by respiration is, hence, not entirely novel. However, the present article provides a very detailed, comprehensive picture of such modulations across brain regions and frequency bands. Moreover, the authors identified respiration-entrained sub-networks through clustering algorithms, and they map these networks onto known 'canonical' functional networks. The high resolution and degree of detail, the advanced methods of dimensionality reduction, the clustering and the mapping to the DNM are interesting and significant advances towards our previous knowledge.

As far as this reviewer can judge all methods have been applied very competently and methods and results are clearly laid out in the text and the illustrations. Nevertheless, there are some general concerns and several specific comments.

1. Nasal versus mouth breathing. Previous work by Tort and coworkers (mice, rats), Zelano and coworkers (humans) and others shows that, in most brain areas, respirational rhythms result from a feedback signal from nasal epithelia towards the brain. They are, hence, NOT caused by the rhythmogenic networks in the brainstem, but rather by sensory afferents (be it mechanosensitive or olfactory). It appears easy to test for the source of the described modulation by comparing the modulation of oscillations by breathing through the nose versus mouth (see, e.g., Zelano et al., 2016). I this reviewer's eyes, such a comparison would have introduced a clearly causal, rather than correlative finding into the paper. Without such (simple) manipulations, the work is mostly descriptive, though at a high level and, hence, still of great merit.

2. Interpretation of data. Related to the first point, the introduction and discussion over-emphasize brain stem, cerebellar and other caudal sources of respiration, while more frontal areas are mostly considered as motor-related networks. Thus, the literature on feedback signaling of mechanical, thermal and also olfactory cues is not sufficiently represented and discussed. Some parts of the discussion have been written in very global terms, e.g. on the importance of rhythmic activity for information processing, active sensing etc. It would be good to relate the concrete findings of the present work to these concepts and focus even more on what has actually been shown.

3. Explanation of methodological limitations. In EEG and MEG recordings, contributions from deep subcortical networks can mostly be indirectly assessed by complex algorithms which leave some room for uncertainty and interpretation. Many readers might not be familiar with methods of source localization in EEG/MEG recordings. While the technical procedures have been well described in the Methods section it would be very helpful to give a brief, qualitative account of the underlying principles in the main text. This could, e.g. be placed in Results (around Figure 2) and/or Discussion and address the underlying principles as well as the power and limitations of such methods.

4. Analysis of inter-regional interactions. In order to test whether oscillations of a given frequency are synchronized between two regions, coherence is a well-established measure. This reviewer does not understand why this relatively simple method has not been applied to the oscillations, revealing a frequency-resolved measure of coordination across frequency and regions. Such data would also substantiate the notion of distinct sub-networks by using an independent approach.

Specific comments (not ranked by importance):

5. Fig. 1C seems to show a modulation of low-frequency MEG signals by respiration (visible at the bottom right corner of the panel). For better visibility it would be helpful to show the PTA-phase-relation over TWO, rather than one, respiration cycle.

6. Upper graphs in in each panel of Fig. 2: the red horizontal line indicating significance threshold is barely visible in my version of the manuscript.

7. For non-specialists, the large number of abbreviations makes the text difficult to read. Would it be possible to give full names upon the first mentioning of a technical / anatomical term within each section (i.e. for Introduction, Results, Discussion and Methods)?

8. The polar plots in Fig. 3 are not easy to read. As a minor correction, the authors might mark the 180° point as the point of inspiration (e.g., adding "I" or "In") and the 0° / 360° point as expiration. Moreover, it would probably be helpful to use a color code for the different frequencies, rather than grey scales.

Reviewer #2, Jan Kujala: The authors studied using MEG resting-state data how respiration influences neural signaling across the whole brain. The investigation was done via detailed spatio-temporo-spectral analyses. The results show that, globally, the whole spectrum of neural activity is affected by respiration. The results also show that different brain regions have distinct temporal and spectral profiles in how their activity is modulated as a function of the respiration phase. The results also suggest that these modulations have distinct spatial profiles where respiration is linked with low- and high frequency neural oscillations in lower and more lateral regions, respectively. The manuscript is well written and thorough and advanced analyses are conducted throughout the manuscript. However, I have some concerns whether the interpretations made based on the results are accurate. In particular, I find that additional analyses are required to demonstrate that the observed spatio-temporo-spectral specificity is meaningful instead of being an epiphenomenon of distinct profiles of neural activity and differential sensitivity of MEG in different brain regions.

Specific comments.

1. Globally, the results very clearly demonstrate that neural signaling across the whole investigated spectrum (2-150 Hz) is linked to respiration and the co-modulation is different across different frequencies. Moreover, the results show that these modulation spectra differ across brain regions. I am not, however, convinced that the present analyses demonstrate how meaningful the differences are and whether their relationship to oscillatory activity has a functional role. As the co-modulation of neural signaling with respiration seems to be very broad-band in nature as demonstrated by the authors as well as, e.g., Zeleno et al (cited by the authors), a strong possibility is that the observed temporo-spectral difference across brain regions are simply due to differences in the profiles of neural activity in them or due to how neural activity is detected with MEG. The same holds for the observed temporo-spectral specificity at the sensor-level. Namely, I find it possible that the majority of the findings within the manuscript could be explained, e.g., by a CO2-level dependent mechanism where all neural activity across the entire spectrum is influenced equally. If this holds, the observed differences could be due to the abovementioned distinct spectral profiles of neural activity across brain regions as well as due to differential delays in how CO2-levels follow the respiration phase in different brain regions. For the sensor-level results this explanation would mean that the spectral and temporal differences in the modulation index (Fig 1b) and phase-triggered average (Fig 1c) could represent the amount and/or SNR of neural activity across the entire brain and also the contribution of individual brain regions where a prominent relationship between neural activity and respiration can be detected due to these factors. Similarly, the voxel-level findings could be explained by variation in the detected spectral profiles of neural activity across brain regions as well as temporal differences in how the CO2-levels follow respiration. To dissociate between these possibilities (a more functionally meaningful role of the spatio-temporo-spectral specificity of the modulation vs. a simpler CO2-level dependent explanation), it would be valuable if the authors would, e.g., investigate the relationship between the modulation index and spectral profiles of neural activity both at the sensor-level and across different brain regions. A straightforward possibility would be to test how correlated the two measures are. If they would show only a weak link, it would suggest that there indeed is a functional role in the distinct spectral profiles of the co-modulation between respiration and neural activity, whereas a strong link between the measures would argue for a simpler explanation, e.g., a CO2-level dependent, global mechanism.

2. As regards the specificity of the findings across brain regions, I find that it would be beneficial if the analysis and illustration of non-negative matrix factorization based components would be expanded. Figure 2 demonstrates the spatial profiles of the components. However, the components are shown pooled together with lines indicating which cluster of voxels represents which component. It would be helpful if the component-specific spatial maps would be shown separately, either in the main manuscript or supplementary material. This would allow the readers to evaluate the whole set of voxels that primarily contribute to the component. Related to spatial profiles, it is unclear how the thresholding was done and what the results indicate. According to the manuscript the spatial maps were thresholded at the 99th percentile. Does this mean that they were thresholded at the 99th percentile across all components and voxels (18x20173)? That is, according the maximum value from amongst all voxels or components? Or was the thresholding component-specific? Or via some sort of a statistical evaluation as figure 2 states that "Colour bar indicates

corresponding p-values"? If the component-specific maps would be shown in the manuscript it would be possible to show the unthresholded maps so that it would be possible to evaluate how spatially specific each component is. Related to the spectral profiles of the components, it is unclear whether the modulation index values used in the statistical evaluation represent the relative average across all voxels or were modulation index values included only from the voxels that survived the 99th percentile thresholding. Regarding the spectral profiles of the components, it would also be beneficial to evaluate quantitatively how they differ between the components. At the moment, the manuscript presents for each component the frequencies where the modulation index is significant by comparing the actual data to surrogate data. In addition to this analysis, it could be evaluated, e.g., how individual components compare to the average of the other components. This could shed some light on whether the components are dissociated at specific, individual frequencies or whether the differences are more intricate with variation between component pairs in diminished and enhanced modulation index values across frequencies.

3. Related to both above points, the authors applied linear mixed effect models (LMEM) to quantify whether the observed apparent differences in the cluster-level spectral profiles according to the anatomical location of the clusters (Fig. 3) is significant. The results showed that the distance to the head centre influenced gamma band modulation whereas regions low in the sagittal plane demonstrated stronger modulation than high regions. However, as these were the only LMEM analyses that were conducted, it is unclear how specific these relationships are. The spatio-specral relationship within the modulation index could be explored further by, first, evaluating for gamma-band the influence of the height of the sagittal plane and for low frequencies the effects of the distance to the center of the head and, second, by investigating relationship along the other planes as well and not restricting the analyses to the apparent differences. Moreover, if the modulation index values are strongly linked to the profile of neural activity (point 1 above), the LMEM analyses could be conducted also for the spectral profiles of neural activity in addition to the modulation index spectra.

Minor comments.

1. In the methods section (p22, line 535) it reads that "adjacent significant data points were defined as clusters". As the data within the manuscript are multidimensional (spatio-temporo-spectral) it would be helpful to clarify whether the adjacency means spatial, spectral or spatiospectral adjacency.

2. In the methods section (p22, line 557) it is stated that "The sensor covariance matrix used for

the LCMV-beamformer was computed across the whole data set.". I assume that this means that a single broad-band (2-150 Hz) beamformer was used to estimate the voxel-level activities across all frequencies. This could be clarified.

Reviewer #3: The authors describe here the anatomical location and spectral profile of the modulation of neural activity along the respiratory cycle, from human MEG data during resting state. While the issue is important and topical, I was left wondering what are exactly the results and whether all necessary controls had been performed. As detailed below, there is little validation of the (complex and novel) methods used, little discussion of possible confounds, but also some discrepancies in how the data look like or how they are described.

Major points

- The strength of MEG signals decreases with distance to sensors. Because the head moves with respiration, it follows that MEG signal power should vary across the respiratory cycle because of head movements. The authors provide a supplementary figure (supp Fig 7) illustrating the measured head movement with respiratory cycle and describe how they regressed out head motion (36 components) from the MEG data prior to data analysis. While this is certainly the best one can do with MEG data at the moment, whether this correction is sufficient or not is not known.

- The results are described as follows in the Abstract: "high gamma modulation increased with distance to the head center, whereas delta and theta modulation decreased with height in the sagittal plane". I was left wondering whether such a physical, rather than physiological, description of the results corresponds to the fact that at least part of the results is due to the physical movement of the head with respiration, rather than to a true modulation of neural activity with respiration

- This impression was reinforced by the fact that the authors did not attempt to demonstrate that they precisely replicate some of the known modulations of neural activity by respiration measured in animals or with intracranial EEG in humans. For instance, they could have a region of interest analysis in the piriform cortex (see Zhou et al eLife 2019 for a parcellation of the human olfactory system) to verify that they reproduce known findings.

- The authors use a novel method, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which has been successfully used in other domains. However, this method has not been validated in the context of source localization of indices derived from MEG data. Could the authors provide some arguments / results to indicate that the results they present are not biased by the use NMF?

- Finally, the authors relate their results to arterial CO2 fluctuations during respiration (discussion, lines 405-415). Could it be that arterial impedance changes across the respiration cycle, leading to changes in the magnetic field and hence to the measured MEG data?

Other concerns

- Could the authors indicate inspiration and expiration on their graphs? Does phase 0 correspond to lungs full or empty? Does it depend on where the respiration belt is placed?

- There seems to be some discrepancy between the spectral profiles of MI (as shown in Fig2), that show peaks suggestive of frequency specificity, and the spectral profiles of component clusters, as shown in Fig3, that rather indicate a broad-band modulation. How come? For example, cluster C in Figure 3, composed of bilateral ACC and right FEF, has a spectral profile that looks quite different from the spectral profiles of bilateral ACC and right FEF as shown in Figure 2.

- The description of the results is sometimes contradictory. Figure 2 shows modulation of neural activity in visual regions (bilateral cuneus, bilateral lingual sulcus), but the authors say with the exception of SMA, all cortical modulations sites are non-sensory, belonging to the default, attention or saliency networks (lines 255-258).

Suggestions for improvement

- Fig 2, add some tick marks on the frequency axis, or write the value of the frequency for each vertical line

- phases are sometimes expressed in degrees (eg Figure 3), sometimes in radians (eg Figure 4)

Reviewer #4: The study by Kluger and Gross investigates the relationship between respiration and different frequencies of resting-state cortical activity in a sample of healthy adults. As with any research question that tackles the relationship between brain measures and a metric that is traditionally seen as an artifact, I had concerns regarding the confounds of the respiration itself and the MEG data. Nonetheless, the authors are transparent about this and do a decent job of removing any confounds that may contaminate the data, which is unsurprising given the authors' expertise in signal processing. However, there seems to be a disconnect between the rationale of the study and the approach, which limits my enthusiasm for the manuscript. My specific comments are below:

Introduction/Discussion:

My biggest concern with this paper is the disconnect between the rationale of the paper and the research approach. The authors do a nice job of laying out the previous work in this field, including in animals and using iEEG. However, the justification for the role of the cortex in oscillatory modulation of respiration (or vice-versa) is that automatic respiration can be overridden using top-down mechanisms. Nonetheless, in the actual experiment participants are instructed to rest with their eyes open, and respiration is recorded passively. Given that there is no overt top-down modulation of respiration in the experiment, a conclusion related to these mechanisms is impossible.

Methods/Results:

What was the procedure for rejection of artifactual data outside of respiration/movement?

In your figures, can you please put corrected p-values rather than percentile? Additionally, the data seems to be thresholded at p = .01 corrected via permutation testing, which is a relatively liberal threshold (and judging from the maps, may be too liberal given the additional clusters that are shown but are likely spurious given their topographic distribution. What does the data look like at a more reasonable p = .005 corrected? Did you use a cluster correction and if so, what was the k?

I am confused as to your rationale for both a whole-brain and ROI approach. Please clarify.

Is there any concern regarding the perceived "direcitonality" of the effects, whereby the frequency changes decrease or increase as a function of distance from the respiration?
