just-noticeable differences (JNDs), interaural level difference (ILD) JNDs, and
diotic intensity JNDs were measured for 20 older hearing-impaired listeners with
matched moderate sloping to severe sensorineural hearing losses. The JNDs were
measured using tone stimuli at 500 Hz. In addition to these auditory tests, the
participants completed a cognitive test (Trail Making Test). Significant
performance improvements in IPD discrimination were observed across test
sessions. Strong correlations were found between IPD and ILD discrimination
performance. Very strong correlations were observed between IPD discrimination
and Trail Making performance as well as strong correlations between ILD
discrimination and Trail Making performance. These relationships indicate that
interindividual variability in IPD discrimination performance did not
exclusively reflect deficits specific to any auditory processing, including
early auditory processing of temporal information. The observed relationships
between spatial audition and cognition may instead be attributable to a
modality-general spatial processing deficit and/or individual differences in
global processing speed.

Introduction
The discrimination of interaural time differences (ITDs) and interaural phase
differences (IPDs) are suprathreshold functions of binaural hearing that facilitate
the localization of sound sources in the horizontal plane. Hearing-impaired (HI)
listeners can show poorer than normal ITD and IPD discrimination performance even in
the absence of a pure-tone hearing loss at the test frequencies (e.g., Koehnke, Culotta, Hawley, &
Colburn, 1995; Moore,
Glasberg, Stoev, Füllgrabe, & Hopkins, 2012; Neher, Laugesen, Jensen, & Kragelund,
2011; Smoski &
Trahiotis, 1986; Strelcyk & Dau, 2009). For this reason, IPD discrimination has
recently been employed in studies searching for cochlear synaptopathy in humans by
exploring the presence of functional impairments in noise-exposed individuals with
clinically normal audiograms (Grose, Buss, & Hall, 2017; Prendergast et al., 2017).

Interindividual variability in IPD discrimination performance among HI listeners has
been found to be, at best, moderately associated with pure-tone hearing thresholds
(Füllgrabe & Moore,
2017, 2018;
Füllgrabe, Sek, & Moore,
2018; King et al.,
2014; Moore &
Sek, 2016). Furthermore, weak to moderate correlations with listener age
have been reported (Füllgrabe
& Moore, 2018; Füllgrabe et al., 2018; King et al., 2014; Neher et al., 2011; Neher, Lunner, Hopkins, & Moore, 2012;
Ross, Fujioka, Tremblay,
& Picton, 2007a). Beginning in mid-life, IPD discrimination
performance tends to decrease with age (Füllgrabe, 2013; Grose & Mamo, 2010; Ross et al., 2007a). In a
meta-analysis of 19 previous studies, Füllgrabe and Moore (2018) concluded that
the percentage of variance in IPD discrimination performance accounted for by the
combination of age and hearing thresholds ranged from 8% to 42%, depending on test
frequency, leaving substantial amounts of interindividual performance variability
unexplained. Since IPD sensitivity is not fully predicted by pure-tone hearing
thresholds and can degrade with aging, IPD discrimination may complement traditional
audiologic measures in building comprehensive auditory profiles beyond the audiogram
(e.g., Houtgast & Festen,
2008; Sanchez Lopez, Bianchi, Fereczkowski, Santurette, & Dau, 2018;
Thorup et al., 2016),
particularly given that IPD discrimination performance has been shown to be
associated with real-world outcomes such as speech perception performance in the
presence of spatially separated interferers (Füllgrabe, Moore, & Stone, 2015; Neher et al., 2011, 2012;
Oberfeld &
Klöckner-Nowotny, 2016; Papesh, Folmer, & Gallun, 2017; Strelcyk & Dau,
2009).

At the level of the basilar membrane, sound signals can be analyzed in terms of an
envelope imposed on a rapidly oscillating carrier, referred to as temporal fine
structure (TFS; Moore,
2008). Information in the TFS is encoded neurally by phase locking:
precisely timed action potentials in the auditory nerve (McAlpine, 2005; Young & Oertel, 2004). IPD
discrimination requires a binaural decoding of TFS information. Under the assumption
that TFS sensitivity, that is, the auditory system’s capacity for processing TFS
information, is the main determinant of IPD discrimination performance and that
other factors such as nonauditory processing efficiency or cognitive abilities are
of minor influence, IPD discrimination has commonly been regarded as a measure of
TFS sensitivity (e.g., Füllgrabe, Harland, Sek, & Moore, 2017; Füllgrabe et al., 2018; Hopkins & Moore, 2010;
Lacher-Fougère & Demany,
2005; Strelcyk &
Dau, 2009). However, some studies have found IPD discrimination
performance by older NH and HI listeners to be significantly associated with
cognitive abilities (Füllgrabe
et al., 2015; Neher
et al., 2012; Rönnberg et al., 2016). Thus, it remains to be clarified if or under
which conditions IPD discrimination performance may be affected by factors other
than TFS sensitivity per se.

The idea for this study arose from observations we made in a previous, unpublished
study. Among other psychoacoustic tests in that study, we measured IPD
discrimination upper frequency limits (FLs) using tone sequence stimuli similar to
those used by Neher et al.
(2011) but with a raised cosine instead of a fully rectified sinusoid as
envelope modulator. Four of the 20 older participants with moderate low-frequency
hearing losses were not able to perform the IPD discrimination task above chance. We
conducted follow-up sessions with three of the participants who failed to perform
the task (the fourth participant was not available), in order to familiarize them
further with the IPD stimuli and to give them task-specific training. However, they
still were not able to detect IPDs at any frequency down to 125 Hz. Furthermore,
they were not able to discriminate interaural level differences (ILDs) at 500 Hz
either. We also administered a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Lin et al., 2017). Although
there was no indication of mild cognitive impairments based on their MoCA scores, we
observed that two of the three participants failed on the first MoCA task, an
adapted, untimed Trail Making B task (Reitan, 1955), which involved drawing a
line connecting 10 alternating numbers and letters in sequence (1-A-2-B and so on;
participants earned one point in this MoCA task if they successfully completed the
trail and failed if, in drawing the line, they made an error that was not
immediately self-corrected). Based on these observations, we conducted this study to
test the hypothesis that IPD discrimination performance is associated with
performance in other tasks, such as ILD discrimination and Trail Making, in a sample
of older HI listeners with matched audiograms.

We measured IPD discrimination FLs and just-noticeable differences (JNDs) repeatedly
across test sessions to explore potential training effects. Furthermore, we included
intensity discrimination and ILD discrimination tasks to examine whether listeners
who show difficulties with IPD discrimination would also experience difficulties
with these tasks as suggested by previous studies (Ochi, Yamasoba, & Furukawa, 2016; Spencer, Hawley, & Colburn,
2016; Whiteford,
Kreft, & Oxenham, 2017). In addition, we investigated potential
relationships between interaural discrimination performance and cognitive abilities
in terms of Trail Making performance. The Trail Making Test part A (TMA), which
involved tapping numbers in sequence on a touchscreen (1–2–3–4 and so on), indexed
processing speed, visual search, and motor skills. In addition, the Trail Making
Test part B (TMB), which involved tapping alternating numbers and letters in
sequence (1–A–2–B and so on), required executive control abilities such as
manipulating information in working memory and attentional task-switching ability
(Arbuthnott & Frank,
2000; Bowie &
Harvey, 2006; Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). The inclusion of the Trail Making Test
was partly motivated by Woods,
Kalluri, Pentony, and Nooraei (2013), who observed that TMB time
accounted for variability in speech perception performance among HI listeners in the
presence of spatially separated interferers after individual differences in
audibility were accounted for. Similarly, Füllgrabe et al. (2015) reported a
significant correlation between TMB time and sentence identification in spatially
separated interferers in a group of older NH listeners. Previous studies that
measured IPD discrimination using tone sequence stimuli mostly included HI listeners
with slight to mild hearing losses in the low frequencies (e.g., Füllgrabe & Moore,
2017; Hopkins &
Moore, 2011; King
et al., 2014; Moore
& Sek, 2016; Neher et al., 2011, 2012; Santurette & Dau, 2012). In contrast,
our participants had moderate losses in the low frequencies. They had very similar
audiometric profiles that fell within the range between the N3 and N4 standard
audiograms, which are most frequently encountered in clinical practice (Bisgaard, Vlaming, &
Dahlquist, 2010). Furthermore, previous studies used adaptive staircase
methods to estimate upper FLs of IPD discrimination whereas we used a Bayesian
procedure (Remus & Collins,
2008). In particular, this procedure allowed for efficient detection of
chance performance, which can be a problem with staircase methods (cf. Bianchi,
Carney, Dau, & Santurette, 2019).

Methods
Participants
The 20 HI participants (11 women and nine men) were aged between 48 and 85 years
(median: 71 years). Their demographic and audiologic information is detailed in
Table 1. They
had bilaterally symmetric audiograms with ear asymmetries equal to or less than
10 dB at all octave frequencies from 125 to 8000 Hz and 750 to 6000 Hz
(exceptions are stated in the table). Pure-tone thresholds averaged across 500,
1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz ranged from 43 to 58 dB hearing level (HL, American National Standards
Institute, 2018), while low-frequency pure-tone thresholds, averaged
across all frequencies from 125 to 1500 Hz (PTALF), ranged from 37 to
52 dB HL. All ears showed clear ear canals under otoscopic inspection, and
air-bone gaps were smaller than or equal to 10 dB, except for participants f9
and m2. Participant f9 showed an air-bone gap of 15 dB at 500 Hz in the right
ear, and m2 showed air-bone gaps of 20 dB at 125 and 250 Hz in both ears.
Furthermore, m2 was the only participant who reported having had ear tubes
inserted at age 8 years. Thus, participants f9 and m2 may have had mixed hearing
losses with small conductive components in the low frequencies, while the
remaining participants showed hearing losses of purely sensorineural origin.
Table 1 lists
the following additional characteristics based on self-report: The age at which
the participant’s hearing loss was detected, whether they experienced tinnitus
at least sometimes or not, and how many years of one-on-one musical training
they had received. All participants were native speakers of American English and
participated in psychoacoustic measurements for the first time. Eighteen of the
20 participants were experienced hearing-aid (HA) users, who had been wearing
HAs for more than 1 year, while participant f4 had been wearing HAs for 3 months
and participant f9 did not use HAs at the time when this study took place.

Cognitive Tests
Montreal Cognitive Assessment
A version of the MoCA for the hearing impaired with visual instructions was
administered nonverbally using a timed PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp.)
presentation (Lin
et al., 2017). The MoCA tested performance on a variety of tasks
such as TMB, clock drawing, animal naming, word recall, or serial
subtraction assessing executive function, visuospatial skills, verbal
fluency, language, attention, abstraction, and orientation. Therefore, the
overall test score was used as a global measure of cognitive performance.
The scores were corrected for education effects by adding one point for
participants f6, f8, and m19, who had 12 or fewer years of formal education
(Nasreddine et al.,
2005). Participant m18 showed the lowest score with a value of 22
out of 30. Based on a cutoff score of 23 (Carson, Leach, & Murphy, 2018),
his score may indicate a mild cognitive impairment. However, since our
objective was to explore relations between cognitive and psychoacoustic
abilities and this participant showed no difficulty with performing all
tasks, we decided to include his data in the analyses.

Trail Making Test
Part A of the Trail Making Test (connecting 25 numbers in sequence,
1–2–3–4 …) (Reitan,
1955) was administered to assess processing speed, visual search
and motor skills. Part B (connecting 25 alternating numbers and letters in
sequence, 1–A–2–B…) was administered to capture executive function in
addition to these cognitive abilities (e.g., Arbuthnott & Frank, 2000; Bowie & Harvey,
2006; Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). The test was implemented in the
Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL version 2.0.4; Mueller & Piper,
2014) and performed via a touchscreen display (GeChic 1303i
13.3-in.). It was based on the PEBL Trail Making Test (Piper et al., 2012) but modified as
described in the following. Similar to paper-pencil versions of the tests,
25 black circles enclosing numbers or letters were displayed on a white
background. In the TMA test, we placed the circles in the layout of the
Halstead-Reitan test, part A (Reitan, 1955), albeit scaled to the
landscape format of the touchscreen (1,920 × 1,080 pixels). For the TMB
test, the layout was mirrored horizontally to preserve the distances and
relative arrangements of the circles in the TMA test. Participants were
instructed to complete the trails as quickly as possible. The instructions
were given nonverbally, as detailed in Appendix A. When a participant
touched the correct circle, the circle briefly lit up in green and a black
line segment was drawn from the previous circle to the present circle. When
they touched the wrong circle, the circle briefly lit up in red and no
connecting line segment was drawn.

Participants first performed a TMA practice run on a shorter layout
consisting of eight circles before performing the 25-circle TMA test.
Subsequently, they performed a short practice run of TMB followed by the
full 25-circle TMB test. In contrast to the MoCA Trail Making subtask, the
Trail Making Test was timed, and the test score was the time to complete the
trail starting from when the circles were first displayed on the screen.
Participants could only fail the TMA or TMB tests if they were not able to
complete each trail within the allowed maximum time of 300 seconds, at which
point the tests were automatically aborted (cf. Bowie & Harvey, 2006).

In addition to the TMA and TMB times, we calculated the difference score
TMB–TMA, which has been considered to be an indicator of executive control
abilities (Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009).

Psychoacoustic Tests
IPD discrimination upper FL
We used a two-interval, two-alternative, forced-choice (2I-2AFC) task similar
to the TFS test described by Füllgrabe et al. (2017) to measure
IPD discrimination upper FLs. Each trial consisted of two intervals
separated by 400 ms. Each interval contained four 400-ms tones (including
50-ms raised-cosine onset/offset ramps) separated by 25-ms silent gaps. All
tones in the reference interval had 0° IPDs. In the randomly chosen target
interval, the first and third tones had 0° IPDs, while the second and fourth
tones had 180° IPDs (−90° and 90° phase shifts in left and right ears,
respectively). Normal-hearing listeners would perceive these antiphasic
tones as lateralized to one side or as diffusely localized in the ears
(Füllgrabe et al.,
2017; Kunov
& Abel, 1981). The frequency of the tones was varied
adaptively from trial to trial. At any given frequency, the tones were
presented at 30 dB sensation level (SL; estimated from audiometric
thresholds as described in the Apparatus subsection below) unless this would
have resulted in a presentation level of more than 95 dB A-weighted sound
pressure level (dBA) at the average human ear drum, which was simulated
using ear simulators (GRAS RA0045) in a KEMAR manikin (GRAS 45BB-7; Burkhard
& Sachs, 1975) with anthropometric pinnae (GRAS KB5000, KB5001). In
these cases, the presentation level was lowered to 95 dBA. This yielded
presentation levels of 30 dB SL for all participants but m3, f8, and f11,
for whom the minimum presentation levels were 15, 20, and 20 dB SL,
respectively (in all three cases, these minimum presentation levels were
reached at 1350 Hz or higher; up to 1000 Hz, all presentation levels
exceeded 25 dB SL).

Participants were instructed to identify the interval in which the sounds
were perceived to move (see Appendix A for detailed participant
instructions). The intervals were visually marked during playback by
flashing boxes on a touchscreen display (GeChic 1002 10.1-in.) placed in
front of the participants, and they responded by touching the corresponding
box. Tone frequency was varied adaptively from trial to trial using the
Bayes Fisher information gain method described by Remus & Collins (2008). The set
of possible tone frequencies were 57 logarithmically scaled values from 125
to 2000 Hz, with the exception of the initial frequency which was 500 Hz in
all runs.

Similar to the procedures in Bianchi et al. (2019) and Füllgrabe et al.
(2017), each IPD discrimination measurement was preceded by a
training run with IPD cues replaced by ILD cues. This ILD training run
consisted of 15 trials, in which the movement in the target interval was
induced by introducing ILDs rather than 180° IPDs in the second and fourth
tones. The ILDs were adaptively varied (Remus & Collins, 2008), while
tone frequency was fixed at 500 Hz. To prevent the participants from
learning loudness rather than movement cues, the levels of the second and
fourth tones in the reference interval were increased by ILD/2 in both ears
to match the levels of the tones in the target interval in the right ear,
which had the level increment of ILD/2. Subsequently, the participants
performed a 10-trial training run of the actual IPD discrimination task with
adaptively varied tone frequency, followed by the measurement run consisting
of 60 trials. Correct-response feedback was provided throughout all training
and measurement runs (this applies to all psychoacoustic tests in this
study).

For each 60-trial measurement run, IPD discrimination performance as a
function of log-transformed tone frequency was modeled as a logistic
psychometric function (PF) with negative slope and fitted using the
psignifit 4 MATLAB toolbox for Bayesian PF estimation
(Schütt, Harmerling,
Macke, & Wichmann, 2016). The IPD FL was defined as the tone
frequency corresponding to the 75 percent-correct point on the estimated PF.
Since the lowest test frequency was limited to 125 Hz, the fitted IPD FL
would have been larger than 0 Hz even in the case of random responses. To
determine the specificity of our procedure to detect chance performance, we
simulated 2,000 random-response measurement runs: 98% of the fitted IPD FLs
fell below 125 Hz (note that the same result was obtained when the
simulations were repeated with a start frequency of 250 Hz instead of
500 Hz). Thus, if a participant’s IPD FL was estimated to be greater than
125 Hz, we could infer with 98% confidence that the participant had not been
guessing randomly. To determine the sensitivity of our procedure to detect
near-chance performance, we ran simulations for a series of poorly
performing observers with varying PF thresholds (IPD FLs) and widths. For an
observer with a true IPD FL of 100 Hz and a shallow PF slope (PF spanning
six octaves from the 53 to 97 percent-correct points, which was the
shallowest slope observed in this study), only 5% of fitted FLs fell below
65 Hz. The percentage was lower for observers with higher true FLs and/or
steeper PFs. Thus, if a participant’s fitted IPD FL fell below 65 Hz, we
could infer with 95% confidence that their true FL was not larger than
100 Hz (assuming their true PF width did not exceed six octaves).

Interaural phase difference JND
The 2I-2AFC measurement of IPD JND was very similar to the measurement of IPD
discrimination FL. The main difference in the IPD JND measurement was that
the tone frequency was fixed at 500 Hz, while the IPDs of the second and
fourth tones in the target interval were varied adaptively to measure
discrimination performance as a function of IPD. The IPDs of the second and
fourth tones had opposite signs, such that the second tone was lateralized
toward the left and the fourth tone was lateralized toward the right side.
This was done to provide participants with movement cues to both sides,
since the side to which the target tones with 180° IPDs in the IPD FL
measurement were lateralized was ambiguous. The set of possible IPDs in the
adaptive run (Remus
& Collins, 2008) were 50 logarithmically scaled values from
0.5° to 180°, with the exception of the initial IPD which was 90° in all
runs. The presentation level for all participants was 30 dB SL. The
instructions were the same as for the measurement of IPD discrimination
FL.

Participants performed a training run consisting of 10 trials before
performing a measurement run of 60 trials. In contrast to the measurements
of IPD discrimination FL, ILD training runs were not included in the IPD JND
measurements. IPD discrimination performance as a function of
log-transformed IPD was fitted using a logistic PF model (Schütt et al.,
2016), and the IPD JND was defined as the IPD corresponding to the 75
percent-correct point.

Interaural level difference JND
Similar to the IPD JND measurement, the ILD JND measurement was also
performed at a fixed frequency of 500 Hz. The main difference was that ILDs
were used to induce movement instead of IPDs. In the reference interval, all
tones had a 0-dB ILD. In the target interval, the first and third tones also
had 0-dB ILDs, while the second and fourth tones had a finite ILD that was
varied adaptively. The ILD was applied by lowering the tone level on the
left by ILD/2 and by increasing it on the right by ILD/2. Thus, both the
second and fourth tones were lateralized toward the right. The set of
possible ILDs in the adaptive run (Remus & Collins, 2008) were 80
logarithmically scaled values from 0.1 to 16 dB, with the exception of the
initial ILD which was 6 dB in all runs.

ILD JNDs were measured in three different experimental conditions similar to
those used by L. R. Bernstein (2004). There was a No Rove condition with the ILDs
applied as described above (all four tones in the reference interval had
identical levels). Furthermore, there was a Level Rove condition, in which
the levels of all four tones in both the reference and target intervals were
roved independently to weaken nuisance single-ear cues such as loudness
differences. Finally, in an IPD/Level Rove condition, random IPDs were
applied to the second and fourth tones in both the reference and target
intervals in addition to roving the individual tone levels. The IPDs of the
second and fourth tones had opposite signs, such that they would shift
lateralization of the second and fourth tone to the left and right,
respectively. The IPD roving was added to explore whether random IPD cues
would interfere with ILD discrimination. The level adjustments in the Level
Rove and IPD/Level Rove conditions were chosen randomly from −10 to 10 dB
(in 0.5-dB steps) for each trial and each of the eight tones. The absolute
values of the IPDs in the IPD Rove condition were chosen randomly from 0° to
45° (in 1° steps) for each trial and each of the four second and fourth
tones. For large enough ILDs, the roving applied in the Level Rove condition
would not have prevented participants from performing the task based on a
loudness comparison between successive tones. In accordance with Green (1988), the
threshold ILD beyond which participants could have relied solely on
single-ear cues was 11.7 dB.

Tone levels (without ILDs and level roving) varied from 28 to 30 dB SL across
trials for all participants but m2 and f7. For m2 and f7, tone levels on
some trials were lowered to 25 and 22 dB SL, respectively, to limit the
maximum presentation level to 95 dBA.

Order effects might have complicated comparisons of individual performance if
the three ILD discrimination conditions had been run block-wise. Therefore,
the conditions were interleaved on a trial-by-trial basis, that is, the
three adaptive runs were performed at the same time. Since the imposed ILDs
shifted both the second and fourth tones to the right side, participants
were instructed to identify the interval in which both tones moved to the
right (see Appendix A). Participants performed a short No Rove training run
consisting of 6 trials followed by interleaved training runs of all three
conditions of 10 trials each, before performing the three interleaved
measurement runs of 50 trials each.

ILD discrimination performance as a function of log-transformed ILD was
fitted using a Weibull PF model (Schütt et al., 2016), and the ILD
JND was defined as the ILD corresponding to the 75 percent-correct
point.

Intensity JND
The 2I-2AFC measurement of intensity JND (INT JND) at 500 Hz used sequences
of diotic tones without any binaural cues. All tones in the reference
interval had identical levels, and the same level was applied to the first
and third tones of the target interval. The second and fourth tones of the
target interval were presented at a higher level. The level increment
relative to the other tones was varied adaptively. The set of possible level
increments were 47 logarithmically scaled values from 0.1 to 10 dB, and all
runs started with an increment of 6 dB. Tone levels (before application of
the level increment) were 30 dB SL for all participants.

Participants were instructed to detect the interval in which the tones varied
in loudness (see Appendix A). They performed a training run of 10 trials
before performing the measurement run of 60 trials. Discrimination
performance as a function of log-transformed level increment was fitted
using a Weibull PF model (Schütt et al., 2016) and the INT
JND was defined as the level increment corresponding to the 75
percent-correct point.

Apparatus
The psychoacoustic tests were performed in a sound-treated room at the Heuser
Hearing Institute. All stimuli were generated in MATLAB at a sampling rate
of 48 kHz, converted to analog signals using an RME Fireface UCX audio
interface with 24-bit digital-to-analog conversion, and presented via
Sennheiser HD 600 headphones. Stimulus presentation levels were calculated
by adding sensation levels to interpolated audiometric thresholds (measured
thresholds were interpolated in dB HL on a logarithmic frequency scale) and
converting dB HL to dB sound pressure level in an artificial ear (GRAS 43AA)
using the probe-tube method described in American National Standards Institute
(2018), with a Sennheiser HDA 200 headphone and an Etymotic
Research ER-7 C microphone used as reference standard earphone and
probe-tube microphone, respectively.

Test sessions
Testing was conducted in two sessions of 1- to 2-hour duration each. After
informed consent and audiological examination, the MoCA was administered.
Testing then proceeded in the first session with four psychoacoustic tests
in the following order: IPD FL, ILD JND, IPD JND, and IPD FL. Testing
resumed in the second session with the following tests: IPD FL, INT JND, IPD
JND, and IPD FL. Thus, to explore potential practice effects, the IPD FL was
measured four times (each time preceded by ILD and IPD training as described
above) and the IPD JND was measured twice. The second session concluded with
the Trail Making Test. The time intervals between the first and second
session varied across participants from a single day to 7 days (median of 3
days), with the exception of participant f9, who performed the second
session 84 days after the first.

Statistical analysis
Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were performed on general linear
mixed-effects models (GLMMs; Bates, Maechler, Bolker, & Walker,
2019) with model selection via F tests with
Kenward–Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (Kuznetsova, Brockhoff,
& Christensen, 2019). Least-squares means were calculated to
estimate effect sizes and to perform post-hoc tests (Lenth, Love, & Hervé, 2019).
The proportion of total variance explained by the fixed effects was
quantified by computing the marginal R2 (Bartoń, 2018; Nakagawa & Schielzeth,
2013). Normality of residuals was judged by means of
Quantile-Quantile plots. Where applicable, p values were
corrected for multiple testing using the method by Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001),
yielding the q value as the analog of the adjusted
p value. The descriptors of correlation strength follow
Evans (1996).
The abbreviation SD stands for standard deviation.

Results
Cognitive Tests
MoCA
The MoCA scores for all participants are listed in Table 1. The mean score was 26.0
(SD = 2.2). Three of the 20 participants (f9, f17, and
m20) failed to successfully draw the alternating trail without (uncorrected)
errors in the untimed TMB subtask of the MoCA.

Trail Making Test
All participants completed the timed TMA and TMB tests in less than 300
seconds. The average TMA and TMB times were 38 (SD = 20)
seconds and 75 (SD = 40) seconds, respectively. Individual
TMA and TMB times ranged from 17 to 88 seconds and 31 to 160 seconds,
respectively. The difference score TMB–TMA had an average value of 37
(SD = 25) and ranged from 4 to 89 seconds.

Psychoacoustic Tests
IPD discrimination upper FL
Figure 1 shows
individual IPD discrimination FLs as a function of measurement number. The
data are given on a linear ordinate scale, as the residuals of a model of
the log-transformed IPD FLs deviated from normality. Due to lack of time,
participant m3 did not perform the second IPD FL measurement in the first
session. Therefore, only three measurements are available for him.
Participant f9 performed poorly in her first measurement, with a fitted IPD
FL of 62 Hz. As this fit was based on extrapolation below the lowest
presented frequency of 125 Hz, we replaced her IPD FL with the estimated
upper bound of 100 Hz (see simulation of near-chance performance in the
“Methods” section). The performance of participants f5, f9, f13, m16, and
f17 were relatively poor in their first measurements but seemed to improve
with time. Similarly, participant f1’s performance also seemed to improve. A
GLMM of the IPD FLs confirmed that the effect of measurement number was
significant, F(3, 56) = 2.98, p = .04,
with average performance continuously improving (measurement 1: 745 Hz,
measurement 2: 756 Hz, measurement 3: 812 Hz, measurement 4: 833 Hz).
Post hoc tests revealed significant differences between measurements 1 and 4
as well as between measurements 2 and 4. Figure 1. Individual IPD discrimination FLs as a function of measurement
number. The thick black curve shows the least-squares means. IPD
= interaural phase difference; FL = frequency limit.



Interaural phase difference JND
Figure 2 shows
individual IPD JNDs as a function of measurement number. Due to an
oversight, participant f13 only performed a single IPD JND measurement.
Participant f9 performed poorly in both measurements. Her fitted IPD JNDs
exceeded the maximum presented IPD of 180° and were substituted by that
value in the figure and in the subsequent statistical analyses. Her poor IPD
discrimination performance at 500 Hz were consistent with her low IPD FLs,
which indicated that she could discriminate between 0° and 180° IPDs only up
to 220 Hz. Overall, the effect of measurement number was significant, GLMM
of the log-transformed IPD JNDs: F(1, 18) = 6.82,
p = .02, with a lower average IPD JND in the second
measurement (22°) than in the first measurement (35°). Figure 2. Individual IPD JNDs as a function of measurement number. The
thick black curve shows the least-squares means. The dashed gray
curve represents the maximum IPD of 180°. IPD = interaural phase
difference; JND = just-noticeable difference.



Interaural level difference JND
Individual ILD JNDs for the three measurement conditions No Rove, Level Rove,
and IPD/Level Rove are shown in Figure 3. ILD JNDs are given on a
logarithmic scale as the nontransformed JNDs (in dB) produced non-normal
model residuals (cf. Spencer et al., 2016). All participants were able to perform the
ILD discrimination task, yielding ILD JNDs smaller than 16 dB for all of the
conditions. However, participants f9, m12, m16, and f17 showed markedly
higher ILD JNDs in the Level Rove and IPD/Level Rove conditions than in the
No Rove condition. It is possible that these participants used single-ear
loudness cues in the No Rove condition. Furthermore, since their ILD JNDs in
the roved conditions approached or exceeded the threshold ILD of 11.7 dB
beyond which the task could be accomplished based on single-ear cues alone,
it is possible that they did not use any spatial cues. A GLMM of the
log-transformed ILD JNDs (log [ILD JND in dB]) confirmed the significance of
measurement condition, F(2, 38) = 5.12,
p = .01, with significantly lower ILD JNDs
(p < .05) in the No Rove condition (2.8 dB) than in
the Level Rove condition (3.9 dB) and IPD/Level Rove condition (4.0 dB).
However, measurement condition was no longer significant when the ILD JNDs
of participants f9, m12, m16, and f17 were excluded from the model,
F(2, 30) = 1.43, p = .25. In this
case, the mean ILD JNDs were 2.5, 3.0, and 3.0 dB for the No Rove, Level
Rove, and IPD/Level Rove conditions, respectively. Figure 3. Individual ILD JNDs for the measurement conditions: No Rove,
Level Rove, and IPD/Level Rove. The thick black curve shows the
means. The dashed gray curve represents the maximum presented
ILD of 16 dB. The dash-dotted gray curve represents the ILD of
11.7 dB above which the task could be accomplished based on
single-ear cues alone. IPD = interaural phase difference; JND =
just-noticeable difference; ILD = interaural level
difference.



Intensity JND
The average INT JND was 1.2 (SD = 0.6) dB. All participants
showed similar performance without any outliers, as reflected by the small
standard deviation. Individual INT JNDs ranged from 0.2 to 2.5 dB.

Relationships Between Test Results
To assess the strength of association between the various cognitive and
psychoacoustic measures, we calculated Pearson’s product–moment correlation
coefficients. The included variables were participant age, PTALF,
MoCA score, TMA time, TMB time, TMB–TMA, IPD FL and IPD JND, both averaged
across repetitions, ILD JND in the Level Rove condition, and INT JND. We
included the ILD JND in the Level Rove condition because single-ear cues could
have been used in the No Rove condition, and the added random IPDs in the
IPD/Level Rove condition could have affected individual performances in various
ways (e.g., some participants might have been insensitive to added random IPDs,
while others might have been distracted by them). Thus, the ILD JND in the Level
Rove condition was the best measure of spatial discrimination
based on binaural ILD cues. Log-transformed, normally distributed TMA and TMB
times, IPD JNDs, ILD JNDs, and INT JNDs were used in the computation of the
correlation coefficients. The resulting correlation matrix is listed in Table 2. After
multiple testing correction (Benjamini & Yekutieli, 2001), all spatial psychoacoustic
measures (IPD FL, IPD JND, and ILD JND) were significantly correlated. In
addition, all of these spatial measures significantly correlated with Trail
Making performance (TMB and/or TMA). The correlations remained significant when
age and PTALF were partialled out (Table 3). Figure 4 shows the correlation between
IPD FL and IPD JND, and Figure
5 shows the correlation between IPD FL and ILD JND. Figure 4. IPD discrimination FL as a function of the IPD JND at 500 Hz. The

The following subsections present statistical models of the psychoacoustic
variables IPD FL, IPD JND, and ILD JND. Given the small interindividual
variability in INT JNDs, we do not present a statistical model of INT JND.

Model of IPD discrimination upper FL
To explore significant predictors of IPD FL, we performed ANCOVAs with IPD FL
as the dependent variable. The tested covariates, in addition to measurement
number, were age, PTALF, MoCA score, log-transformed TMA and TMB
times as well as the difference score TMB–TMA. We also tested the
significance of presence of tinnitus and years of musical training. All
predictors were tested in backward elimination. In addition to the
significant effect of measurement number, F(3, 56) = 2.96,
p = .04, TMB time was a significant predictor,
F(1, 18) = 48.5, p < .0001. The
interaction of TMB time with measurement number was not significant
(p = .28). Figure 6 shows individual IPD FLs as
a function of TMB time along with a regression line. IPD FL decreased with
increasing TMB time. TMA time and the difference score TMB–TMA were not
significant when TMB time was included in the model
(p > .3). They were, however, both significant
(p < .01) when TMB time was deliberately excluded.
Effects of age, PTALF, MoCA score, tinnitus, and musical training
were not significant (p > .17). Together, the fixed
effects measurement number and TMB time explained 63% of the variance. Figure 6. Individual IPD discrimination FLs as a function of TMB time. The
dashed curve shows a linear regression line. IPD = interaural
phase difference; FL = frequency limit.



To explore the extent to which TMB time mediated effects of age on IPD FL, we
examined a path model with age as an independent variable, IPD FL as the
dependent variable, and TMB time as the mediator (Baron & Kenny, 1986). The model
revealed that age had no significant effect when TMB time was controlled,
thus demonstrating perfect mediation of age by TMB time (Baron & Kenny,
1986).

Model of interaural phase difference JND
We performed ANCOVAs with IPD JND as the dependent variable and tested the
same covariates as in the preceding subsection. In addition to the
significant effect of measurement number, F(1, 18) = 5.67,
p = .03, TMB time was a significant predictor,
F(1, 18) = 31.9, p < .0001. IPD
JNDs increased with increasing TMB time. The interaction with measurement
number was not significant (p = .15). Similar to the IPD FL
results, TMA time and the difference score TMB–TMA were not significant in
the model with TMB time (p > .4), but were both
significant (p < .05) when TMB time was deliberately
excluded from the model. Effects of age, PTALF, MoCA score,
tinnitus, and musical training were not significant
(p > .3). The fixed effects measurement number and TMB
time explained 54% of the variance.

Model of interaural level difference JND
ANCOVAs with ILD JND as the dependent variable revealed significant effects
of measurement condition, F(2, 38) = 5.12,
p = .01, MoCA score, F(1, 17) = 7.28,
p = .02, and TMA time, F(1,
17) = 13.8, p = .002. ILD JND increased with increasing TMA
time and decreased with increasing MoCA score. Interaction terms were not
significant (p > .5). Furthermore, TMB time was not
significant (p = .81) when TMA time was included in the
model but was significant (p = .004) when TMA time was
deliberately excluded. The difference score TMB–TMA was not significant,
regardless of whether TMA time was included or not
(p > .3). Furthermore, effects of age, PTALF,
tinnitus, and musical training were not significant
(p > .14). The fixed effects measurement condition, TMA
time, and MoCA score together explained 54% of the variance.

Discussion
Overall, the results of the individual cognitive and psychoacoustical tests reported
in this work are consistent with the literature. Details of this consistency are
discussed in the subsections that follow. The practice effects observed for some
listeners in the IPD discrimination tasks are also discussed. Most important,
however, were the clear and consistent relationships observed between primary
measures, including IPD discrimination, ILD discrimination, and Trail Making. These
relationships suggest that in an older HI population, IPD discrimination performance
does not reflect TFS sensitivity per se, but must be influenced by factors that are
not specifically auditory and may be of higher order. These possibilities are
discussed with reference to a conceptual model.

Cognitive Tests
The MoCA scores of our study participants were very similar in terms of mean and
standard deviation to those reported in previous studies with HI participants
(Dupuis, Marchuk, &
Pichora-Fuller, 2016; Lin et al., 2017).

The Trail Making Test scores obtained in our study cannot easily be compared in
absolute terms with the literature since we used a touchscreen version of the
Trail Making Test, with identical but mirrored trails for part A and B.
Nevertheless, the observed mean TMA and TMB times were similar to those reported
by Woods et al.
(2013) for participants with comparable hearing losses and those for
the elderly, healthy participants in Tombaugh (2004) and Periáñez et al. (2007).
Furthermore, our Trail Making scores were consistent with the literature in that
TMB times were larger than TMA times by a factor of two, and TMB times
correlated significantly with age and TMA times, as well as the difference score
TMB–TMA (Arbuthnott &
Frank, 2000; Corrigan & Hinkeldey, 1987; Tombaugh, 2004; Yeudall, Reddon, Gill, & Stefanyk,
1987).

Psychoacoustic Tests
The mean IPD discrimination FL of 787 (SD = 257) Hz observed in
this study was consistent with the mean IPD FLs ranging from 583 to 808 Hz in
previous studies that used similar tone sequence stimuli (Füllgrabe & Moore, 2017; Moore & Sek, 2016;
Neher et al.,
2011).1 The average IPD JND of 28° observed at 500 Hz in our study was consistent
with the average IPD JNDs of 25°, 25°, and 32° obtained by Hopkins and Moore (2011), Neher et al. (2012),
and King et al.
(2014), respectively, but smaller than the average IPD JND of 58°
reported by Moore and Sek (2016).2 To our knowledge, ILD JNDs have not been measured previously in HI
listeners with tone sequence stimuli such as those used in this study. However,
the range of observed ILD JNDs in the Level Rove condition was consistent with
the ILD discrimination thresholds for 1/3-octave noise bands centered at 500 Hz
reported by Koehnke et al. (1995, Figure
3) and Spencer
et al. (2016) for their HI participants.

Effects of practice on IPD discrimination
We observed significant performance improvements from measurement to
measurement for IPD FLs and IPD JNDs. These improvements were consistent
with the practice effects observed for ITD discrimination at 500 Hz by Spencer et al.
(2016) in HI listeners and by Ortiz and Wright (2009, 2010) in NH
listeners. In particular, for the IPD FLs the largest average performance
improvement was observed between the two test sessions (between measurements
2 and 3). This is consistent with Ortiz and Wright (2010), whose NH
participants reached their best ITD discrimination performance not
immediately following training but with 10 hours of rest after training and
into the following day. Presumably, new IPD discrimination skills had been
acquired in the short-term during the first test session of this study, and
consolidation of learning took place in the hours following and into the
second test session. Füllgrabe et al. (2017) and Füllgrabe and Moore (2017) observed
no practice effects for IPD FLs obtained with young and older NH listeners,
respectively. Similarly, Hopkins and Moore (2010) observed no practice effects for IPD
JNDs obtained with young NH listeners. However, the present results suggest
that these findings do not transfer to HI listeners. Some of our HI
participants improved with practice in both IPD FL and IPD JND measurements,
resulting in average practice effects for the whole group. In comparison
with the above mentioned studies, which repeatedly measured only IPD FLs (or
IPD JNDs), we administered IPD JND and ILD JND measurements in between IPD
FL measurements. This might have enhanced practice effects. However, it is
clear from the present results that some participants did not reach
asymptotic performance in the first two or three measurement runs. Thus,
there is no reason to believe that practice effects would have been
altogether absent if only IPD FLs (or IPD JNDs) had been measured.

In this study, we adopted a training paradigm that has been used in many
previous studies exploring IPD discrimination with tone sequence stimuli
(e.g., Bianchi et al.,
2019; Füllgrabe et al., 2017; Hopkins & Moore, 2011; Neher et al.,
2011): IPD cues were initially replaced with ILD cues, because ILD
cues presumably result in more discriminable lateralization for all
participants, in particular for older HI listeners. However, Ortiz and Wright
(2010) found that, in order to improve NH listeners’ ITD
discrimination performance, training based on ITD discrimination proved more
effective than ILD discrimination. It is unclear if this would hold true for
older HI listeners. However, considering that ILD stimuli can introduce
listeners to single-ear loudness cues, it might be better to resort to
training listeners only with IPD stimuli in preparation for IPD
discrimination measurements.

Relationships Between Test Results
A moderate negative correlation (r = −.47) was observed between
IPD FL and age, which was no longer significant when the multiple testing
correction was applied. Furthermore, the correlation between IPD JND and age
(r = .37) was not significant, and no significant effect of
age was observed in any of the statistical models. Although low power
contributed to the lack of significance (the sample size of 20 participants
resulted in a power of 0.8 for detecting associations of
r = .58 or stronger), the strength of the observed age
correlations was nevertheless consistent with previous studies that measured IPD
FLs and IPD JNDs in older listeners with and without low-frequency hearing
losses (Füllgrabe et al.,
2018; King
et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2007a). However, a wide range of age correlations has
been reported. Some studies observed very weak correlations of age with IPD FLs
(Füllgrabe & Moore,
2017; Moore &
Sek, 2016), while others have observed strong correlations with IPD
JNDs (Füllgrabe & Moore,
2018; Hopkins
& Moore, 2011; Moore, Glasberg, Stoev, Füllgrabe, &
Hopkins, 2012).

The correlations with PTALF were weak and not significant, and
PTALF was not a significant predictor in any of the statistical
models either. This can be attributed to the homogeneity of our participant
group in terms of their audiograms (best and worst PTALF differed
only by 15 dB, with an SD of 4.5 dB across listeners) as well
as low power. Nevertheless, the observed weak strength of correlations was
consistent with previous reports of weak correlations between IPD FL, IPD JND,
ILD JND, and pure-tone thresholds or PTALF (Füllgrabe et al., 2018; Hopkins & Moore,
2011; Spencer
et al., 2016). However, moderate correlations between IPD FLs, IPD
JNDs, and hearing loss have also been reported (Füllgrabe & Moore, 2017; Füllgrabe & Moore,
2018; King
et al., 2014; Moore & Sek, 2016).

Bianchi et al. (2019)
observed that both NH and HI musicians with at least 8 years of formal music
education showed lower IPD FLs than nonmusicians. Our data showed no significant
effect of years of musical training, which may be attributable to low power as
only six of our participants had 4 years or more of musical training.
Furthermore, we observed no significant effect of tinnitus on spatial
discrimination, which is consistent with Hyvärinen, Mendonça, Santala, Pulkki, and
Aarnisalo (2016).

IPD FL was very strongly correlated with IPD JND (r = −.89),
reflecting the similarity of these measures in assessing IPD discrimination
(Füllgrabe et al.,
2017; Moore &
Sek, 2016). Both IPD FL and IPD JND were very strongly correlated
with TMB time (r = −.86 and r = .81,
respectively), and TMB time was also the strongest predictor in the respective
statistical models. Besides TMB time, significant correlations were also
observed with TMA time and the difference score TMB–TMA (with absolute values of
r ranging from .66 to .76). Interestingly, ILD JND was also
significantly correlated with TMA time (r = .74), IPD FL
(r = −.70), and IPD JND (r = .66). In
addition to TMA time, statistical modeling showed that the MoCA score was also a
significant predictor of ILD JND.

Taken together, the observed significant relationships between IPD
discrimination, ILD discrimination, and Trail Making formed a closed triangle of
associations. These associations remained mostly unchanged when effects of age
and hearing loss were partialled out. Füllgrabe et al. (2015) previously
observed a moderate association between IPD discrimination and TMB time in older
listeners with normal pure-tone thresholds in the low frequencies. Furthermore,
three previous studies observed significant associations between IPD or ITD JNDs
and ILD JNDs. Ochi et al.
(2016) observed a moderate correlation between ITD JND and ILD JND
for complex tones centered at 1100 Hz in a mixed group of young NH and older NH
and HI listeners. Whiteford
et al. (2017) also found a moderate correlation between JNDs for
discrimination of dynamic IPDs and dynamic ILDs for 500-Hz tones in a sample
comprising young and older listeners with normal hearing in the low frequencies.
Spencer et al.
(2016) observed a very strong correlation between IPD JND and ILD JND
for 1/3-octave noise bands at 500 Hz in HI listeners.

IPD or ITD processing in the auditory system is based on phase locking of
auditory nerve action potentials to TFS and subsequent coincidence detection in
the auditory brainstem (McAlpine, 2005; Young & Oertel, 2004), whereas ILDs are thought to be encoded in
the brainstem independently of TFS (Brown & Tollin, 2016; Franken, Joris, & Smith,
2018). Thus, if interindividual variability in IPD discrimination
performance reflected deficits specific to TFS processing, which is not utilized
in ILD coding, IPD and ILD discrimination performance would not be associated.
Further, if variability in IPD discrimination performance reflected
modality-specific deficits in audition as opposed to modality-general deficits,
IPD discrimination would not be associated with a nonauditory cognitive measure
such as Trail Making. Therefore, the associations between IPD and ILD
discrimination observed here (and in three previous studies) and the observed
associations between IPD discrimination and Trail Making imply that the
variability in IPD discrimination performance across HI listeners did not
exclusively reflect deficits specific to TFS processing or even audition in
general.

Previous studies have explored relationships between TFS processing and cognitive
functions in HI participants (Neher et al., 2011, 2012; Rönnberg et al., 2016)
and older participants with normal pure-tone thresholds in the low frequencies
(Füllgrabe et al.,
2015, 2018). Rönnberg
et al. (2016) reported the outcomes of exploratory factor analyses
performed on a test battery of various auditory and cognitive tests completed by
200 HI participants. They observed a significant correlation between a TFS
factor and a cognition factor. The TFS factor loaded primarily on IPD JNDs
measured at 250 Hz and to some extent on monaural spectro-temporal modulation
thresholds (Bernstein et al.,
2013), while the cognition factor loaded primarily on measures of
executive function and secondly on auditory working memory. Rönnberg et al. (2016)
speculated that one possible interpretation for the observed relationship
between TFS and cognition factors was that both IPD JND and spectro-temporal
modulation detection tasks placed high demands on auditory working memory.
However, this is not supported by Füllgrabe et al. (2015), who observed
no significant correlations between TFS processing abilities and working memory
capacity assessed in terms of reading span. In that study, the cognitive
measures that correlated significantly with TFS sensitivity were TMB, a map
search test, a digits forward test, an auditory elevator counting test, and a
block design test (for details, see Füllgrabe et al., 2015). Both Füllgrabe et al. (2015)
and Füllgrabe et al.
(2018) observed no significant correlations between TFS sensitivity
and performance on a matrix reasoning test, which is a measure of nonverbal
intelligence without imposed time limits. Consistent with Füllgrabe et al. (2015), Neher et al. (2012)
observed a significant correlation between IPD JND and map-search performance
but not reading span. Neher
et al. (2011) also observed no correlation between IPD FL and reading
span. Füllgrabe et al.
(2015) used a composite TFS score consisting of both monaural and
binaural TFS measures in their correlational analysis. When considered
separately, performance on the binaural IPD discrimination task correlated more
strongly with all of the above mentioned cognitive measures than performance on
the monaural frequency discrimination task using complex tones (Füllgrabe et al., 2015,
supplementary material). However, the significance of these differences in
correlations was not assessed, and thus no firm conclusions can be drawn as to
whether IPD discrimination primarily drove the significant correlations between
the cognitive measures and the composite TFS score or not. Nevertheless, at
least the studies by Neher
et al. (2012) and Rönnberg et al. (2016) who observed significant correlations between
cognitive abilities and TFS sensitivity could alternatively be interpreted as
indicating a relationship between cognitive abilities and spatial auditory
function (binaural processing ability in terms of IPD discrimination) instead of
basic, monaural TFS processing abilities.

TMA time, TMB time, and the difference score TMB–TMA are partly complementary
measures of cognitive abilities (e.g., Arbuthnott & Frank, 2000; Bowie & Harvey,
2006; Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). TMA time indexes processing speed,
visual search, and motor skills. In addition to these factors, TMB time reflects
executive function including the ability to manipulate information in working
memory and attentional control processes necessary to manage rapid task
switching (e.g., Arbuthnott
& Frank, 2000; Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). As
regards the interpretation of the difference score TMB–TMA, no consensus has
been reached. Sánchez-Cubillo et al. (2009) considered it to be a relatively pure
indicator of executive function, whereas Arbuthnott and Frank (2000) suggested
that it reflected processing speed and visual search. In this study, IPD
discrimination was correlated with and predicted by TMA time, TMB time, and the
difference score TMB–TMA. Thus, it seems that processing speed, visual search,
and executive function may have played a role in the observed relationships with
IPD discrimination. ILD discrimination was significantly correlated with TMA
time but not TMB time or the difference TMB–TMA. It remains unclear why
executive function would have been linked with IPD discrimination but not ILD
discrimination. In addition to processing speed, visual search, and executive
function, the Trail Making Test indexed motor speed. However, since motor speed
should not have influenced IPD or ILD discrimination performance, it is not
discussed further here.

It is possible that the observed relationships between IPD discrimination, ILD
discrimination, and Trail Making times could be traced back to a common cause
(Humes & Young,
2016; Pichora-Fuller, 2003), as visualized in Figure 7. Such a common cause could be
individual differences in processing speed, which may arise on a peripheral
neural level and/or on a global cognitive level (Figure 7). One possible cause for
individual differences in processing speed is global slowing with aging (Myerson, Hale, Wagstaff, Poon,
& Smith, 1990; Salthouse, 1996; Schneider, Pichora-Fuller, & Daneman,
2010). Indeed, a path model revealed that TMB time was a perfect
mediator of age-related effects on IPD FL in this study. Thus, age had no effect
on IPD FL when TMB time was controlled. However, we observed no significant
correlation between ILD JND and age, which is consistent with earlier reports
that brainstem ILD coding is resilient to aging (Caspary, Ling, Turner, & Hughes,
2008). Thus, age was likely not the sole determinant of the observed
relationships between spatial audition and cognition in this study. This is in
agreement with the conclusion by Humes and Young (2016) that sensory
processing and cognition are linked independently of age. Importantly, this does
not rule out the possibility that individual differences in processing speed,
independent of age, were responsible for the observed correlations. Consistent
with this hypothesis, Oberfeld and Klöckner-Nowotny (2016) observed a significant
correlation between IPD JND and processing speed, as indexed by response time in
the neutral condition of a visual flanker task, in a group of young NH
listeners. Figure 7. Conceptual model of relationships between IPD sensitivity, ILD
sensitivity, and Trail Making. IPD = interaural phase difference;
ILD = interaural level difference; TFS = temporal fine
structure.



The IPD and ILD discrimination tasks were both spatial tasks, and the Trail
Making Test parts A and B involved the processing of spatial information
required for visual search. Thus, the mutual relationships between these
measures might indicate some kind of modality-general spatial processing deficit
as a common cause. Indeed, all of our participants performed well on the diotic
intensity discrimination task as opposed to the spatial discrimination tasks.
Similarly, Füllgrabe et al.
(2015) observed no significant correlations between
amplitude-modulation detection thresholds for diotic tones and cognitive
abilities after applying a multiple-testing correction. If a spatial processing
deficit explained the observed relationships between IPD and ILD discrimination
performance, it would need to result from processes beyond the level of the
brainstem, because (a) IPDs and ILDs are encoded independently at the level of
the mid-brain (Brown &
Tollin, 2016), and (b) our data show that the relationship between
IPD and ILD discrimination performance was perfectly mediated by Trail Making
performance. The hypotheses of a spatial processing deficit and individual
differences in processing speed are not mutually exclusive. A modality-general
spatial processing deficit could conceivably arise in conjunction with slowed
processing speed (see Figure
7).

One might argue that the difference score TMB–TMA reflected neither processing
speed nor visual search, since these factors were common to both TMA and TMB
tasks. Thus, the observed correlation between TMB–TMA and IPD discrimination
would seem at odds with the above hypotheses of a spatial processing deficit or
individual differences in processing speed. However, such an interpretation of
the difference score is not supported by Arbuthnott and Frank (2000), who
suggested that the difference TMB–TMA did in fact reflect processing speed and
visual search. The latter view is in agreement with the very strong correlation
between TMB–TMA and TMB time observed in this study and in previous studies
(Arbuthnott & Frank,
2000; Corrigan
& Hinkeldey, 1987; Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009), taken
together with the consensus that TMB time reflects visual search (see Table 1 in Sánchez-Cubillo et al.,
2009).

One avenue to investigate the hypotheses of a spatial processing deficit or
individual differences in processing speed in future studies would be to include
more spatial and nonspatial psychoacoustic measures, for example,
frequency-modulation detection (Strelcyk & Dau, 2009; Whiteford et al.,
2017), and nonspatial cognitive tests of processing speed in addition to
the Trail Making Test used here. We mentioned in the “Introduction” section that
4 out of 20 participants in a previous, unpublished study were not able to
perform above chance on a similar IPD FL task. In contrast, all participants in
this study were able to perform the task. This also highlights the necessity for
follow-up research, possibly in a larger study sample. Importantly, the results
of the unpublished study are consistent with the associations observed in this
study: The three participants who failed on the IPD FL task and who returned for
follow-up testing also failed on the ILD discrimination task in the Level Rove
and IPD/Level Rove conditions, and two of them failed on the untimed TMB subtask
of the MoCA.

One might speculate that the spatial auditory and cognitive tasks, in particular
TMB, used in this study had in common a high task complexity that required
sustained attention throughout task performance. This could have influenced both
auditory and cognitive performance. However, such an explanation for the
observed correlations does not seem to be consistent with the results of Füllgrabe et al. (2015,
2018) and Neher et al. (2011,
2012), who used
complex reading span or matrix reasoning tests but did not observe significant
correlations between IPD discrimination and reading span or matrix reasoning
scores. In this regard, it would be valuable to employ objective measures of IPD
sensitivity (e.g., Grose
et al., 2017; Papesh et al., 2017; Ross et al, 2007a; Ross, Tremblay, & Picton,
2007b; Vercammen,
Goossens, Undurraga, Wouters, & van Wieringen, 2018) in addition
to psychoacoustic measures to further clarify relationships between spatial
audition and cognition in HI individuals.

An important implication of the demonstrated relationship between IPD sensitivity
and Trail Making performance is that results from a simple auditory test might
be effectively used to predict performance in higher level spatial and/or
cognitive domains (cf. Humes
& Young, 2016). In this way, IPD sensitivity could potentially be
used as a marker for other cognitive or processing speed deficits. A similar
marker-based approach has already been proposed for Alzheimer’s disease, where
correlates between disease subtypes and spatial hearing deficits have been
observed (Golden et al.,
2014).

Conclusions
Strong to very strong correlations were observed between IPD discrimination, ILD
discrimination, and Trail Making performance in a sample of 20 older HI listeners
with matched moderate sloping to severe sensorineural hearing losses. These
correlations imply that interindividual variability in IPD discrimination
performance did not exclusively reflect deficits specific to TFS processing or even
audition in general. Instead, a modality-general spatial processing deficit and/or
individual differences in global processing speed may have affected both spatial
auditory and cognitive performance. Significant performance improvements in IPD
discrimination were also observed across test sessions.

Appendix A—Participant Instructions
The instructions for the Trail Making Test were displayed to the participants on the
touchscreen in front of them. The instructions for the psychoacoustic tasks were
given to them in writing while being read out aloud by the experimenter.

Instructions for Trail Making Test
Part A
On the next screen, you will see circles with numbers. Begin by tapping
number 1, followed by 2, then 3, then 4, and so on, until you reach the end
(1-2-3-4 …). When you tap the correct circle, a connecting line will be
drawn. If you do not tap the correct circle, no line will be drawn. The test
is timed. Work as fast as you can. When you are ready, tap the screen to
begin a practice run.

Part B
On the next screen, you will see circles with numbers and letters. Begin by
tapping number 1, followed by A, then 2, then B, then 3, then C, and so on,
until you reach the end (1-A-2-B-3-C…). When you tap the correct circle, a
connecting line will be drawn. If you do not tap the correct circle, no line
will be drawn. The test is timed. Work as fast as you can. When you are
ready, tap the screen to begin a practice run.

Instructions for IPD Discrimination
In this measurement, we test how well you can hear certain differences between
sounds. You will be listening to tones presented over headphones. On each trial,
you will hear two tone sequences:

beep beep beep beep  beep beep beep beep

While they are playing, the first tone sequence and second tone sequence are
visually highlighted on the touchscreen in front of you by the labels “1st” and
“2nd,” respectively. Please take a look at the screen now.

The first and second tone sequences differ in terms of their
positions. This is what you need to listen for: One tone
sequence will be positioned unmoving in the center of your head. It sounds like
mono presentation. In the other tone sequence, movement will
occur: The tones will move repeatedly from the center to the side of your head.
This may sound like going from mono to stereo. For example:

             beep   beep

beep beep beep beep  beep   beep

Your task is to identify the tone sequence where the movement
occurred. Whether the movement will occur in the first or second
tone sequence will vary randomly from trial to trial. If you heard movement in
the first sequence …

  beep   beep

beep   beep      beep beep beep beep      Press “1st”

If you heard movement in the second sequence …

              beep    beep

beep beep beep beep   beep    beep        Press “2nd”

The task will vary in difficulty from trial to trial. If you are not able to tell
whether movement occurred in the first or second tone sequence, just guess one
of the two (“1st” or “2nd”).

After you enter your response, you will receive feedback: The correct response
will be highlighted in green. Please pay attention to this feedback. We will
begin with a training run.

Instructions for ILD Discrimination
The next measurement is very similar to the preceding measurements. Again, you
need to listen for movement in the tone sequences.

Your task is to detect the tone sequence where both tones move to the
right side.


Note, the tones may vary in loudness. However, you cannot accomplish the task by
focusing on the loudness of the tones because these are random loudness
variations. Instead, listen for movement and indicate whether
it was the first or second tone sequence in which both tones moved to the right
side.

After you enter your response, you will receive feedback: The correct response
will be highlighted in green. Please pay attention to this feedback. We will
begin with a training run.

Instructions for Intensity Discrimination
In the preceding measurements, you listened for movement. In contrast, in the
next measurement you need to listen for changes in loudness.

Your task is to detect the tone sequence in which the tones varied in
loudness. For example:

beep beep beep beep   beep BEEP beep BEEP      Press “2nd”

The task will vary in difficulty from trial to trial.

After you enter your response, you will receive feedback: The correct response
will be highlighted in green. Please pay attention to this feedback. We will
begin with a training run.

Notes
1 Füllgrabe and Moore
(2017), whose HI participants were on average 7 years older and
had milder low-frequency losses (PTALF) by 6 dB, obtained an
(arithmetic) mean IPD FL of 763 (SD = 277) Hz. Moore and Sek
(2016), whose listeners were on average 3 years older and had
milder PTALF’s by 6 dB, observed a mean IPD FL of 583
(SD = 290) Hz. The participants in Neher et al. (2011)
had on average milder low-frequency losses by 15 dB compared with this
study. When only considering their 10 participants with the strongest
low-frequency losses, the difference in mean PTALF shrinks to
7 dB. These participants were on average 2 years younger than our
participants, and their mean IPD FL was 808 (SD = 255)
Hz.

2 Moore and Sek
(2016) observed an average IPD JND of 58°. Excluding the 20
youngest participants and 29 participants with the mildest hearing losses at
500 Hz in King et al.
(2014), the average IPD JND for the remaining 10 HI participants
in that study was 32°. These 10 participants were on average 3 years younger
and still had 17 dB milder losses at 500 Hz than those in this study. Neher et al. (2012)
observed an average IPD JND of 25° for their nine HI participants aged 49
years and older (on average 6 years younger than those in this study) with
low-frequency losses averaged across 125, 250, 500, and 750 Hz ranging from
19 to 43 dB HL (the corresponding low-frequency losses in this study ranged
from 34 to 52 dB HL). Finally, excluding the 3 youngest participants and 12
participants with the mildest losses in Hopkins and Moore (2011), the
remaining 10 HI participants showed an average IPD JND of 25°. These 10
participants were on average younger by 4 years than the participants in
this study and also had milder losses at 500 Hz, on average by 14 dB.
