and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).Human brain development is a complex process that follows sequential
orchestration of gene expression, begins at conceptual stages, and continues
into adulthood. Altered profile of gene expression drives many cellular and
molecular events required for development. Here, the molecular events during
development of human prefrontal cortex (PFC) (as an important executive part of
the brain) were investigated. First, the RNA-sequencing data of BrainSpan were
used to obtain differentially expressed genes between each two developmental
stages and then, the relevant biological processes and signaling pathways were
deduced by gene set enrichment analysis. In addition, the changes in
transcriptome landscape of PFC during development were analyzed and the
potential biological processes underlie the changes were found. Comparison of
the four regions of PFC based on their biological processes showed that
additional to common biological processes and signaling pathways, each PFC
region had its own molecular characteristics, conforming their previously
reported functional roles in brain physiology. The most heterogeneity in
transcriptome between the PFC regions was observed at the time of birth which
was concurrent with the activity of some region-specific regulatory systems such
as DNA methylation, transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and presence of
different transcription factors and microRNAs. In conclusion, this study used
bioinformatics to present a comprehensive molecular overview on PFC development
which may explain the etiology of brain neuropsychiatric disorders originated
from malfunctioning of PFC.

==== Body
Introduction
Brain development is a very complex, dynamic, and multistage process that involves
precisely orchestrated sequence of cellular and molecular events (Silbereis et al., 2016).
This development begins within weeks of conception (∼third gestational week) and
continues through the adolescence (Stiles and Jernigan, 2010). Many controlled
morphogenesis processes such as cell division, differentiation, migration, and
neural fate specifications generate distinct parts that are cooperatively functional
in architecture of the brain (Anderson et al., 2013). Of all brain regions, the prefrontal cortex
(PFC) (the anterior part of the frontal lobe) coordinates a wide range of cognitive
processes whose cardinal role is mediating complex behaviors rather than basic
cognitive activities (Frith and
Dolan, 1996). Malfunctioning of the PFC is greatly linked to many human
cognitive problems (Siddiqui
et al., 2008) as well as psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder
(Clark and Sahakian,
2008; Abé et al.,
2015), schizophrenia (Wible et al., 2001), attention-deficit or hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
(Vaidya, 2011), drug
addiction (Goldstein and Volkow,
2011), autism (Goldberg et al., 2011), and depression (Koenigs and Grafman, 2009). Thus,
understanding the details of molecular events that occur during maturation of this
part may be an important issue for resolving various dilemmas concerning such
phenotypes. PFC comprises four distinct parts including dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DFC), medial prefrontal cortex (MFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VFC),
and orbital frontal cortex (OFC) which have subtle differences in their physiology
and tasks during human lifetime (Yu et al., 2016). Although there is a functional connectivity throughout
PFC and also throughout whole brain (Pessoa, 2014), most studies surveyed the
physical and functional changes during maturation of PFC and there is little known
about the genetic and molecular changes across the developing human brain. Since,
expression alteration in a subset of genes may be critical to drive one premature
developmental stage to the next (Erraji-Benchekroun et al., 2005), it is of great importance to find and
analyze the genes responsible for each developmental stages. Interestingly,
BrainSpan database is the atlas of the developing human brain providing a detailed
global characterization and comparison of the genes separately expressed by 26
different brain regions during 12 developmental times. This article exploits the
RNA-seq data of this database to depict the major molecular events occurred during
development of PFC from its early embryonic state through adolescence.

Materials and Methods
Study Design
In spite of the existence of numerous reports on functional role of many genes in
brain development, there is a lack of a comprehensive study to describe
molecular events across developmental process of human brain, from conceptual
stages to adulthood. Therefore, this study was designed to identify potential
biological processes and signaling pathways, responsible for development of
human PFC as a prominent executive part of the brain. To do so, gene expression
profile (RNA-seq data) of one developmental stage of PFC was compared with the
next stage, and the resultant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
analyzed to obtain relevant biological processes and signaling pathways.
Thereafter, these biological processes or signaling pathways were interpreted
and their relevance to different times of PFC development was described (Figure 1). In addition,
for validation or comparison of the obtained results, similar approaches were
performed on the raw (RNA-seq and microarray) data of BrainSpan as well as
analyzing the microarray data produced by Kang et al. (2011) (GEO number:
GSE25219).

Figure 1. Workflow of this study from data collection to processing steps. Based on
the RNA-seq data of 12 developmental stages of developing human brain,
DEGs between two immediate stages were identified. After validation of
the identified DEGs through their comparison with microarray data, they
were used as input for gene set enrichment analysis by DAVID. Finally,
analysis of the BPs and SPs, for these DEGs was performed. Output data
of the workflow (BPs and SPs) were further interpreted and illustrated
in next analytic steps of this study. pcw = postconceptual weeks;

Differentially Expressed Genes
The RNA-seq and microarray data of different parts of human brain for 12
different developmental stages are deposited in the Allen Institute for Brain
Science BrainSpan Atlas (http://www.brainspan.org),
and the details of tissue acquisition, processing, and RNA-sequencing can be
found on the website.

In this study, the RNA-seq and microarray data of four distinct regions of PFC
across different times of brain development were used. These four regions
include DFC, MFC, VFC, and orbital frontal cortex (OFC). The DEGs between two
immediate developmental stages of each region were obtained by “differential
search” approach of the BrainSpan database (http://www.brainspan.org/rnaseq/search/index.html). This website
compares the expression profile of a developmental stage with another stage and
represents the genes with absolute log2 fold change (FC).

Additional to the online analysis by BrainSpan, the raw datasets of BrainSpan and
also the microarray data of Kang et al. (GSE25219) were downloaded and analyzed
by the R package limma (Smyth et al., 2005) for validation of our DEGs. Prior to comparison
of developmental stages and in order to ruling out the effects of heterogeneity
in sample sizes of developmental stages, “downsampling” approach was performed.
For this purpose, two samples (one male and one female) of the existed samples
in each developmental stage were selected randomly. Thereafter, for validation
of the results, the data of downsampling and those of total sampling were
compared with each other, using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. Using
Venn diagram by the online tool Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics
(http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/), we found the
overlapped data between the DEGs resulted from RNA-seq data analysis and those
of microarray data sources.

For both RNA-seq and microarray data, genes were considered as significantly
differentially expressed between groups when false discovery rate
p was <.05 and the absolute log2 (FC) was
≥2.

Functional Classification of DEGs
To identify which biological processes and signaling pathways are involved in the
development of PFC, gene ontology (GO) analysis of biological processes and
signaling pathways was performed by the “Database for Annotation, Visualization
and Integrated Discovery” (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). The lists of DEGs (Supplemental
File S1) were used as input of the DAVID software, and the results were
presented based on GO terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways. Adjusted p < .05 was considered as statistically
significant of the enrichments.

Gene Coexpression Analysis
We used the R package weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) (Zhang and Horvath,
2005; Langfelder and
Horvath, 2008) for analysis of the raw RNA-seq data of BrainSpan to
find modules of coexpressed genes, potentially involved in the development of
PFC. In detail, first, gene clustering tree was created based on expression
similarity of the genes across all developmental stages of PFC. Following
pruning the less connected nodes, the modules with the maximal number of the
genes (more than 600 genes) were retained for subsequent analysis. To determine
PFC-specificity of the modules, we used Jaccard index to compare the modules
with WGCNA data of other brain regions. To summarize the expression profile of
each module, principle component analysis (PCA) was performed. The resulting PC1
was plotted against developmental stages, and a smooth curve was fitted by
smoothing spline to display the developmental trajectories of the modules.

Gene Expression Trajectories
To investigate cell type switching during PFC development, we utilized the raw
RNA-seq data of BrainSpan and explored the expression pattern of some selected
genes which previously reported as specific markers of different cell types of
central nervous system (such as Astrocytes, Oligodendrocytes, microglia, neurons
and neural stem/progenitor cells) (Cahoy et al., 2008; Artegiani et al., 2017;
McKenzie et al.,
2018).

The same procedure was also performed for three general transcription factors
(TFs) (TBP, RNase-H1 and SPARCA2) which were previously reported as the genes
tightly relevant to RNA polymerase activity (Kotsantis et al., 2016). Expression
level of the genes was calculated as RPKM.

Global Transcription Rate Assessment
To acquire a view on the role of global transcription regulation (RNA polymerase
activity level) in development of PFC, relevant GO terms of biological processes
in each developmental stage (Supplemental File S2) were taken into account
(Table 1).
Accordingly, the value of “global transcription rate” was calculated by the sum
of all positive and negative regulatory processes of DEGs for each developmental
transition.

Global Transcription Rate Throughout Development of Human Prefrontal

Principle Component Analysis
We performed PCA on the raw RNA-seq data of the BrainSpan to compare the
transcriptome of the four studied regions of PFC (DFC, MFC, VFC and OFC).

Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis tools Excel and GraphPad Prism (version 6) were used for
analysis and representation of data. The value of p less than
.05 was considered as statistically significant. Correlation analysis was also
performed using GraphPad Prism (version 6) software, represented as a Pearson
coefficient. Regression and x-bar analysis were performed by
Minitab (version 16) software.

Results
Identification of Potential Biological Processes Involved in the Development
of Human PFC
PFC is known to be divided into four regions (DFC, MFC, VFC, and OFC) whose
development may require activity of many biological processes. Therefore, using
RNA-seq data of 12 different developmental stages of these regions, DEGs between
each of the two subsequent stages were initially derived from BrainSpan (Figure 1). Thereafter,
gene set enrichment analysis of these DEGs by DAVID gene classifier predicted
many biological processes that are potentially important for transition from one
developmental stage to the next (Supplemental File S2). In addition, for
validation of these DEGs, they were compared with the DEGs obtained from the
microarray data of BrainSpan and Kang et al. (GEO number: GSE25219).

Using the RNA-seq DEGs as the input of DAVID software, the results of gene
enrichment analysis for all the studied developmental stages of PFC regions
together with their corresponding biological processes were presented (Figures 2 to 5). For such enrichment
analysis of biological processes, both level of expression changes
(|Log2 FC| ≥ 2) and p value (Adjusted
p < .05) were considered as the threshold of statistical
significance.

The results of comparison of RNA-seq and microarray data for DFC region showed a
significant positive correlation (R2 = .711,
p value = .0013) between their numbers of DEGs (Figure 2(a)). Also, most
of the microarray DEGs were overlapped with the analyzed RNA-seq DEGs (Figure 2(b)).

as statistically significant. Numbers show developmental transitions
with their corresponding biological processes. The transitions without
numbers had no significant enriched biological processes.
DFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; DEG = differentially expressed
genes.

Enrichment analysis of the DEGs for DFC showed that the biological processes
linked to cell division, DNA replication, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair
were significantly enriched for the Transition 1. The biological process of cell
division is continued to the Transition 2, while the Transitions 3 and 4 had no
significantly enriched biological processes.

During Transition 5, biological processes of transcription regulation, nervous
system development, hippocampus (HIP) development, cell adhesion, and axon
guidance or extension were enriched. During developmental Transition 6,
extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, oxygen
transport, aging, response to calcium, and responses to stresses (such as
wounding and hypoxia) were significantly enriched.

Concerning Transition 7 of the DFC development, the biological processes of cell
proliferation, cell adhesion, neuronal differentiation, and responses to
progesterone, drugs, and hypoxia were enriched. Other processes of this
transition were translation initiation, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), protein
targeting to membrane, and notch signaling pathway.

The Transition 8 harbors the biological processes related to synaptic development
(chemical synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter secretion, neuron projection,
synaptic potentiation, synaptic assembly, and plasticity), nervous system
development, learning, behavior, and GTPase-mediated pathways.

In Transition 9, cell adhesion was significantly enriched. The biological
processes of NMD, protein translation, and protein targeting to membrane were
significantly enriched. In the last developmental transition of DFC, the
biological process of cellular response to extracellular stimuli was
enriched.

The developmental stages (transitions) of DFC with their enriched biological
processes are shown in Figure
2(c).

The results of the comparison between RNA-seq and microarray data of MFC region
showed a significant positive correlation
(R2 = .5246, p = .0117) between
their numbers of DEGs (Figure
3(a)). Also, the overlap between the lists of microarray DEGs and the
analyzed lists of RNA-seq DEGs is shown in Figure 3(b).

transition of MFC. (a) The significant positive correlation between the
numbers of the DEGs identified by analysis of microarray (y-axis) and
RNA-seq (x-axis) data. (b) The degree of similarity

DEGs which were also identified as DEGs by RNA-seq data analysis. (c)
The enriched biological processes predicted to be involved in different
developmental transitions of MFC. Adjusted p < .05
was considered as statistically significant. Numbers show developmental
transitions with their corresponding biological processes. The
transitions without numbers had no significant enriched biological
processes. MFC = medial prefrontal cortex; ECM = extracellular matrix;
SRP = signal recognition particle; NMD = nonsense-mediated decay; CENP =
centromere protein.

Like DFC, the first developmental transition of MFC was concurrent with the
biological processes related to cell division, DNA replication, telomere
maintenance, and DNA repair.

There was no prediction of any biological processes for the DEGs of the
Transitions 2, 3, and 4 in MFC. The Transition 5 of MFC was concurrent with the
biological processes of Transcription regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis,
development of axons and dendrites, DNA methylation, and RNA splicing.

During Transition 6 of MFC, ECM organization, cell adhesion, cell migration, NMD,
rRNA processing, protein translation, protein targeting to membrane,
angiogenesis, responses to wounding, and hypoxia were significantly enriched.
The enriched biological processes of Transition 7 in MFC were neuropeptide
signaling pathway, translational initiation, female pregnancy, and
microtubule-based processes.

Most of the enriched biological processes in Transition 8 of MFC were similar to
those of DFC, except the biological process of protein degradation via
ubiquitination and proteasome.

During Transition 9 of MFC, the biological processes related to ECM organization,
cell proliferation, cell migration, cell adhesion, regulation of cell shape,
cell maturation, and angiogenesis were significantly enriched. While no
significant biological process was observed for the Transition 10, in the
Transition 11 of MFC, the enriched biological processes were negative regulation
of growth and cellular responses to metal ions (including zinc and cadmium)
(Figure 3(c)).

Comparing the number of microarray DEGs and that of RNA-seq DEGs showed a
significant positive correlation in VFC (R2 = .7885,
p = .0003) which could confirm the DEGs identified by
RNA-seq data of the BrainSpan (Figure 4(a)). Comparing the lists of the DEGs from microarray and
those of the RNA-seq data also showed an overlap between the DEGs within each
developmental transition (Figure 4(b)).

Figure 4. The biological processes predicted to be involved in each developmental
transition of VFC. (a) The significant positive correlation between the
numbers of the DEGs identified by analysis of microarray
(y-axis) and RNA-seq (x-axis)
data. (b) The degree of similarity between the DEGs identified by
microarray data analysis and those from RNA-seq data analysis. Bars
represent the percentages of the microarray DEGs which were also
identified as DEGs by RNA-seq data analysis. (c) The enriched biological
processes predicted to be involved in different developmental
transitions of VFC. Adjusted p < .05 was considered
as statistically significant. Numbers show developmental transitions
with their corresponding biological processes. The transitions without
numbers had no significant enriched biological processes.
ECM = extracellular matrix; SRP = signal recognition particle;
NMD = nonsense-mediated decay; VFC = ventrolateral prefrontal cortex;
CENP = centromere protein.

In VFC, like aforementioned regions, the enriched biological processes of the
first developmental transition were related to cell division, DNA replication,
telomere maintenance, and DNA repair. While no significant biological processes
were predicted for DEGs of the Transitions 2 and 4 of MFC, the biological
process of “retinal ganglion cell axon guidance” was significantly enriched for
Transition 3 of VFC.

The enriched biological processes for Transition 5 of VFC were transcription
regulation, covalent chromatin modification, nervous system and brain
development, and axon development (axon extension and guidance).

The biological processes of transcription regulation, rRNA processing, NMD,
protein translation, protein targeting to membrane, cellular responses (to
hypoxia and wounding), angiogenesis, and ECM organization were significantly
enriched for Transition 6 of VFC.

The Transition 7 of VFC is concurrent with differentiation of oligodendrocytes,
neurons, and endodermal and epithelial cells. Other enriched biological
processes are cell adhesion, ECM organization, cell proliferation and migration,
responses (to wounding and hypoxia), and angiogenesis.

The biological processes in Transition 8 of VFC were related to nervous system
development, synaptic development (chemical synaptic transmission,
neurotransmitter secretion, neuron projection, synaptic potentiation, synaptic
assembly, and plasticity), ion transmembrane transport (calcium), cell adhesion,
learning, behavior, GTPase-mediated pathways, and protein degradation via
ubiquitination and proteasome.

During Transition 9 of VFC, in addition to the biological processes of NMD, rRNA
processing, translation initiation, protein targeting to membrane, ECM
organization, cell adhesion, epithelial cell differentiation, the biological
processes of “Type-1 interferon signaling pathway,” and “regulation of blood
pressure” were enriched.

In Transition 10, the biological processes of rRNA processing, NMD, protein
translation, and protein targeting to membrane were enriched in addition to the
emergence of mitochondrial electron transport, NADH to ubiquinone.

In the last transition of VFC, the biological process of “chorioallantoic fusion”
was significantly enriched (Figure 4(c)).

In OFC, in order to validate the DEGs of BrainSpan RNA-seq, they were compared
with the lists of the DEGs of microarray data. Results showed a positive
correlation (R2 = .7821, p = .0003)
between the number of RNA-seq and microarray DEGs (Figure 5(a)) and also there were overlaps
between these two types of DEGs (Figure 5(b)).

Figure 5. The biological processes predicted to be involved in each developmental
transition of OFC. (a) The significant positive correlation between the
numbers of the DEGs identified by analysis of microarray
(y-axis) and RNA-seq (x-axis)
data. (b) The degree of similarity between the DEGs identified by
microarray data analysis and those from RNA-seq data analysis. Bars
represent the percentages of the microarray DEGs which were also
identified as DEGs by RNA-seq data analysis. (c) The enriched biological
processes predicted to be involved in different developmental
transitions of OFC. Adjusted p < .05 was considered
as statistically significant. Numbers show developmental transitions
with their corresponding biological processes. The transitions without
numbers had no significant enriched biological processes. OFC = orbital
frontal cortex; TGF = transforming growth factor; ECM = extracellular
matrix; NMD = nonsense-mediated decay; DEG = differentially expressed
genes.

The first developmental transition of OFC is enriched for the biological
processes of cell division, DNA replication, DNA repair, transcription from RNA
polymerase II, collagen fibril organization, uretic bud development, and
osteoblast differentiation where the latest four biological processes are unique
to this region (see Figures
2 to 5;
Transition 1).

While there was no significant enrichment for the Transition 2 of OFC, the
biological processes of mitotic cell division, chromatin dynamics (aggregation
and segregation), NMD protein translation, protein targeting to membrane, oxygen
transport, and negative regulation of neuron differentiation were significantly
enriched for Transition 3. Transition 4 of OFC is concurrent with biological
processes related to transcription regulation.

The enriched biological processes for Transition 5 of OFC were regulation of gene
expression, RNA processing and mRNA splicing, cholesterol biosynthesis,
isoprenoid biosynthesis, and axon guidance. For the developmental Transition 6
of OFC, the biological processes of rRNA processing, NMD, protein translation,
protein targeting to membrane, ECM organization, angiogenesis, responses (to
hypoxia and wounding), platelet degranulation, and leukocyte migration. The two
later processes may mediate the activation of immune system in this transition.
The enriched biological processes of the Transition 7 of OFC were related to
cell adhesion, hair follicle development, endodermal cell differentiation, ECM
organization, skeletal system development, nervous system and brain development,
angiogenesis, response to wounding, amino acid transport and metabolic processes
of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), retinoid, and glutamate biosynthesis.

During Transition 8, the biological processes of synaptic development and
activity, nervous system development, intracellular protein transport,
vesicle-mediated transport, neurotransmitter secretion, ion transportation,
protein degradation via ubiquitination and proteasome, and GTPase-mediated
signaling were enriched. The Transition 9 of OFC was predicted to be linked with
the biological processes of ECM organization, cell adhesion, cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, cell migration, endodermal cell differentiation, responses to
wounding and TGF-β signaling, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase
II. The transition of 10 of OFC is concurrent with two immune system-related
processes: defense response to virus and Type-1 interferon signaling pathway.
However, there was no enriched biological process for the last transition of the
OFC region (Figure
5(c)).

Orchestrated Change of the Involved Biological Processes in the Development
of PFC
To find the modules of coexpressed genes across development of PFC, the R package
WGCNA was used. A total number of 61 modules were predicted for PFC (Figure 6(a)) which were
not observed in WGCNA results of other brain regions (Jaccard index < 0.0037;
Supplemental File S3). We also investigated trajectories of the modules across
development of PFC by calculating the module eigengene. Thereafter, biological
processes related to each module were predicted by DAVID software.

Figure 6. Gene clusters and their corresponding biological processes involved in
the development of prefrontal cortex. (a) Clustering result of WGCNA on
transcriptome of the prefrontal cortex. Modules of coexpressed genes are
shown as colored box below the dendrogram. Eight modules (M1–M8) showed
at least 600 genes with common expression trend during development.
(b–i) The trajectory of each modules together with their enriched
biological processes, predicted by DAVID software. For all the
enrichment analysis, an adjusted p value < .05 was
considered as statistically significant. Vertical red lines denote the
time of birth. GPCR = G-protein coupled receptor; ECM = extracellular
matrix.

Results showed the earliest change for Module 7 (M7) which started from the Stage
1 (8–9 postconceptual weeks [pcw]) of prefrontal development. Predicted
biological processes for this module were transcription regulation, signal
transduction, signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors, ECM organization,
skeletal system development, and collagen fibril organization. The activity
level of this module is sustained until adulthood, suggesting the importance of
its genes in all developmental stages (Figure 6(b)).

The second increase in activity was observed for the Module 3 (M3) which was
enriched for transcription regulation, mRNA splicing, negative regulation of
translation, and protein degradation occurring at Stage 2 (10–12 pcw). However,
this module has a decreasing expression pattern as the PFC is developing (Figure 6(c)).

The next upregulated module was M2 which was increased at Stage 3 (13–15 pcw).
The genes in this module mainly contribute in DNA replication, DNA repair, cell
cycle promotion, cell proliferation, neuronal stem cell maintenance, and dentate
gyrus development. This module gradually is increased during PFC development
until the Stage 9 (19–60 months after birth). After this time, the level of this
module is remained in a steady state (Figure 6(d)).

In the postnatal stages of PFC development, upregulation of the modules M1, M8,
and M9 was observed. The corresponding biological processes include
oxidation–reduction processes, angiogenesis, and response to stimuli and immune
system (for M9); transmembrane transportation of ions, chemical synaptic
transmission, G-protein-coupled receptors signaling, and regulation of apoptosis
(for M1); and regulation of transcription, axon guidance, protein stabilization,
serine or threonine kinase activity, and HIP development (for M8). The lowest
expressions of these modules were observed in prenatal stages (13–18 pcw) (Figure 6(e) to (g)).

Unlike stage-specific modules (biological processes), there were two modules (M4
and M10) which exhibited ever-changing patterns in their expression which may
highlight their importance throughout the development. Module 4 (M4) modules
were predicted to be involved in gene expression regulation (e.g., mRNA
splicing, rRNA processing, and transcription of snRNAs by RNA-pol II),
telomerase activity, and protein metabolism (Figure 6(h)). For Module 10 (M10), the
biological processes of neural tube development, cell differentiation, and
neurogenesis were enriched, suggesting the active neural system development
throughout PFC development (Figure 6(i)). Taken together, this result shows that PFC development
is mediated by sequential expression alterations of the genes which drive
several biological processes.

Cell Type Conversions During Development of PFC
To explore how a population of neural cell types (such as neural stem or
progenitor cells astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons) could be
changed during developmental stages of PFC, expression trajectories of their
specific markers were analyzed. Results showed that the highest expression of
stem or progenitor cell markers is belonged to the early prenatal stages of PFC
development (Figure
7(a)). Neuronal cell markers started to be increased at the middle stages
(around the time of birth) (Figure 7(b)). Also, the markers of microglial cells showed an
increase in expression level at most of the stages of PFC development (Figure 7(c)), suggesting
the active immune system throughout these stages. The expression of astrocyte
and oligodendrocyte markers was observed to be increased at the late stages of
PFC development (Figure 7(d)
and (e)). According to these data, we can conclude that development
of PFC is associated with changes in population of particular cell types (Figure 7(f)).

The Numbers or FCs of DEGs Are Not Due to Alterations in Global Transcription
Rate
To investigate if the number or FCs of DEGs in developing PFC is modulated by
general transcriptional regulatory system, first, the biological processes which
are linked to RNA polymerase (RNA-pol) activity (Table 1) were taken into account and a
scatter plot was generated. Analysis of the scatter plot by nonlinear regression
method showed a convergence distribution (p = .04) with a
dynamic pattern. Also, these data demonstrated highest rates of global
transcription for the Transitions 4 and 5 of PFC development (Figure 8(a)). The lowest
rate of global transcription was observed for the earliest and latest stages of
PFC development. However, the global transcription rate in OFC at Transition 1
and Transition 9 in MFC showed a different pattern. Moreover, the observed
global transcription rate was significantly correlated with the expression
trajectory of at least one of the TFs TBP, RNase-H1, and SPARCA2 (Figure 8(b)). However, due
to the odd data of the global transcription rate of the MFC at Transition 9, the
calculated correlation was not significant (Figure 8(b)). The detailed correlation
data of these analyses are in the Supplemental File S4.

To investigate if the RNA polymerase-related biological processes (Table 1) are
responsible for the architecting DEGs during development of PFC, the correlation
between the numbers and FC magnitude of DEGs and global transcription rates was
analyzed. Results showed no significant correlation between global transcription
rates and numbers (R2 = .015,
p = .43) or mean FCs of DEGs
(R2 = 9.2 × 10−6,
p = .98) (Figure 8(c) and (d), respectively). These data suggest that general
transcriptional regulatory system could not be the main determinant of DEGs
profile across development of PFC.

Biological Processes That Underlie the Dynamic Transcriptome of PFC During
Development
As shown before, regulatory processes of global transcription are not the
underlying mechanisms for dynamic transcriptome of PFC during development (Figure 8(c) and (d)).
Therefore, we decided to compare the other enriched biological processes
(Supplemental File S2; p < .05) with numbers and mean FCs of
DEGs in developmental stages of PFC. Results not only depicted dynamic feature
of PFC transcriptome during development but also highlighted several biological
processes that potentially may affect both frequencies (numbers) and FCs of DEGs
(Figure 9). Such
variations in number and FCs of DEGs during PFC development represent dynamic
characteristic of PFC transcriptome.

processes which potentially affect the observed numbers or fold change
values of the DEGs. DFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; MFC = medial
prefrontal cortex; VFC = ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; OFC = orbital

In addition, comparison of the transcriptome landscape between four regions of
PFC depicted a similar pattern with the exception of a window of meaningfully
diverse transcriptome between Transitions 5 and 7 (from 25 pcw to 5 months after
birth) (Figure 9;
Transitions 5–7). Through analysis of the enriched biological processes in these
transitions (Supplemental File S2), we found the biological process with
regulatory roles on gene expression and, interestingly, they were enriched in a
region-specific manner.

As shown in Figure 9, the
biological process of transcription termination (at Transition 1) is occurred
commonly in all prefrontal regions, thus it may alter their transcriptome,
coordinately. Unlikely, between Transitions 5 and 7, transcriptome of the
regions was diverse but concordant with region-specific regulatory processes
such as regulation of mRNA splicing and DNA methylation in MFC, transcription
regulation in DFC and VFC, and regulation of RNA processing in OFC (Figure 9; Stage 5). During
Transition 6, the gene regulatory systems mediated by microRNAs and TFs were
significantly enriched (p < .05) which may differentially
alter the transcriptome of each region of PFC (Figure 9; Stage 6).

On the other hand, transcription landscape of the next transitions pointed out
the Transition 9 harboring ∼1,000 DEGs with the greatest mean FC (∼20). By
looking at the list of these DEGs, we found that the greatest number of them are
noncoding RNAs of different classes (Supplemental File S1). A similar landscape
was observed when downsampling method was applied on the raw RNA-seq data of the
BrainSpan (Supplemental File S5-A), which also showed a significant correlation
between the number of DEGs, calculated by these two different methods
(R2 = .8684; p < .0001)
(Supplemental File S5-B).

Potential Signaling Pathways Involved in the Development of PFC
To find the signaling pathways potentially involved in the development of PFC,
enrichment analysis of signaling pathways was performed in DAVID software using
the DEGs of each developmental transition as input. Results showed a list of
signaling pathways which differ in their specificity to the regions or
developmental times of PFC (Table 2). Due to such time- and region-specific enrichments, a set
of signaling pathways could be considered as a signature for each developmental
transition or region of PFC.

Prefrontal Cortex Regions.



	
Note. The four studied regions of prefrontal cortex
are shown as DFC, MFC, VFC, and OFC. Each region of prefrontal
cortex contains 12 developmental transitions (numbered as 1–11). The

enrichment of each pathway. As shown, signaling pathways are
distributed across the table in a time-and region-dependent manner.
These data show that some of the pathways are common and the other
ones are specific to particular regions or developmental transitions
of prefrontal cortex. For enrichment analysis, the DAVID software
was used and a p < 0.05 was considered as
statistically significant. KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and

Comparison of the Human PFC With Other Brain Regions Based on Their DEGs and
Biological Processes
To investigate if DEGs and their corresponding biological processes could
discriminate PFC from other regions of human brain, Venn diagram analysis was
performed. For this purpose, the lists of DEGs and biological processes of five
regions including HIP, amygdala (AMY), primary visual cortex (V1C), primary
auditory cortex (A1C), and cerebellum cortex (CBC) (Supplemental File S6) were
compared with those of PFC. Results showed that the studied brain regions can be
distinguished based on their DEGs (Figure 10(a) to (e)) and biological
processes (Figure 10(f) to
(j)). Also, we found that the similarity degree between these brain
regions could be deduced from their lists of DEGs and BPs (Figure 10(k)). However, the PCA on the
transcriptome data of PFC could not segregate DFC, MFC, VFC, or OFC regions
(Figure 10(l)),
suggesting their similar transcriptome.

Discussion
Brain development is a multistage process, accompanied by coordinated expression of
many genes (G.-Z. Wang and
Konopka, 2013). Thanks to availability of spatiotemporal transcriptome of
the human brain by BrainSpan (www.brainspan.org); in this
study, we investigated to find biological processes as well as signaling pathways,
correspondingly involved in the development of PFC of human brain. Thereafter,
biological processes that underlie the dynamic feature of PFC transcriptome during
its development were explored. Moreover, the observed developmental processes of the
PFC were compared with some other brain regions to evaluate their specificity.

As an important executive part of the human brain, the PFC is the main focus of this
study. PFC occupies one third of the entire human cerebral cortex and it can be
divided into four sections: DFC, MFC, VFC, and OFC (Siddiqui et al., 2008) which are
structurally connected while functionally distinct (Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2001; Johansen-Berg et al.,
2004). Due to such characteristics and also its previously mentioned
prominent role in normal brain physiology (Fuster, 2001; Miller and Cohen, 2001; Lara and Wallis, 2015) and
several human psychiatric phenotypes (Fuster, 2001; Lagopoulos et al., 2012), we were
interested to find molecular mechanisms underlying its development. To this end,
RNA-seq data of the BrainSpan database were used to determine DEGs between
subsequent developmental stages of PFC (Figure 1). For validation of the DEGs, the
similar approaches were performed on microarray data. In addition, using
downsampling method on the raw data of RNA-seq in BraiSpan, we confirmed the
identity of the DEGs for downstream analyses.

After the identification and validation of the DEGs, gene set enrichment analysis was
performed by DAVID software and the R package WGCNA in order to derive biological
processes and signaling pathways potentially involved in development of PFC. Through
interpretation of the results of DAVID and WGCNA, the developmental transitions of
PFC with their enriched biological processes are demonstrated in Figures 2(c) to
5(c). As shown in Table 3, the first developmental transition (around 10th pcw) of PFC was
predicted to be mediated by the biological processes that are restricted to DNA
metabolism and cell division (or mitosis) which are characteristic features of
neural stem or progenitor cells (Murao et al., 2016).

Table 3. The Biological Processes Which Were Commonly Enriched for All Prefrontal
Cortex Regions.



	
Note. These biological processes are not region-specific
and may orchestrate the development of prefrontal cortex regions. Each
number in the column 2 denotes the developmental transitions of 1-11.
DFC= dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; MFC= medial prefrontal cortex; VFC=
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; OFC= orbital frontal cortex;
ECM= extracellular matrix.

The second series of commonly enriched biological processes were “positive regulation
of transcription” and “nervous system development,” occurring at the developmental
Transition 5 (around 24th pcw) (Table 3). Notably, the biological processes of this transition are
closely similar between all PFC regions.

Transition from Stages 6 to 7 (time of birth) is concurrent with “ECM organization,”
“cell adhesion,” “angiogenesis,” “response to hypoxia or wounding,” and “protein
metabolism” for all regions. Nevertheless, the difference is that the “translation
initiation” (as a part of protein metabolism) is started in MFC, VFC, and OFC, but
not still started in DFC (Table
3). Also, biological processes related to immune system activation
(“platelet degranulation” and “leukocyte migration”) are also common for all PFC,
implying that immune system is particularly important during Transition 6 (i.e.,
around the time of birth: 38 pcw). Consistently, increasing evidence have shown the
causative role of perinatal immune system malfunctioning in neuropsychiatric
conditions (Hagberg and Mallard,
2005; Missig et al.,
2018). Expression analysis of the specific marker of microglial cells
across developmental transition of PFC region emphasizes on the remarkable increased
level of these cells (and immune system activity) at the time of birth (Transition
6) (Figure 7(c)).

In comparison with other developmental transitions, the biological processes of
Transition 8 (between the Stages 8 and 9) are more similar throughout DFC, MFC, VFC,
and OFC. In fact, transition from Stages 8 to 9 mostly requires some processes such
as “chemical synaptic transmission,” “nervous system development,” “learning,”
“neuron projection development,” “synapse assembly and potentiation,” “GTPase
activities,” and “ion transmembrane transport”. However, regarding the ion
transportation, the only enriched biological process for DFC was “calcium ion
transport.” In addition, GTPase activities can drive many signaling pathways within
neurons (Aspenström, 2004;
Stankiewicz and Linseman,
2014); therefore, it is acceptable that the greatest number of signaling
pathways are particularly enriched for the DEGs of the Transition 8 (see Table 2). Moreover, unlike
in previous transitions where protein metabolism was restricted to rRNA processing,
NMD and translation initiation, during this time, posttranslational processes such
as “protein ubiquitination,” “proteasome-mediated catabolic process,” and
“intracellular protein transport” were enriched. Such posttranslational processes,
however, were not still enriched for DFC that again confirmed the delay in protein
metabolism of this region (Table 3; green highlighted). Consistently, in a previous study,
comparative proteome analysis of PFC of nine schizophrenia and seven healthy
individuals showed an altered protein profile in DFC among all PFC regions (Martins-de-Souza et al.,
2009).

In the Year 5 of human brain development (Transitions 9–11), the biological processes
vary greatly between PFC regions so that “cell adhesion” is the only common
biological process of Transition 9 shared between all regions while the other
enriched biological processes are region specific.

By comparing the mean FC of DEGs throughout all developmental transitions, we found
that the developmental Transition 9 of all regions possessed the highest FC value
(Figure 9). Analysis of
the DEGs in this transition revealed that most of the DEGs are noncoding RNAs
(ncRNAs). In fact, these DEGs encode vast variety of ncRNA classes such as ribosomal
RNAs (rRNAs), pseudogene RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), small nuclear RNAs
(snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), small cytoplasmic RNAs (scRNAs), and so
forth (Supplemental File S1). The evident regulatory role of ncRNAs (Wery et al., 2011) and
their differential expression during Transition 9 (∼5 years after birth) highlights
their necessity in functionality of developed PFC. A comprehensive study by He et al. (2014) showed low
but ever-changing expression of lncRNAs across developmental time series of human
PFC. Consistent with our results, they also found that a significant expression
alteration of lncRNAs predominantly occurs in late developmental stages (∼9 years
after birth) of PFC (He et al.,
2014). The essential role of such regulatory RNAs is reflected in almost
every aspect of neural system behavior, including chromatin modification (by Y RNAs)
(Kowalski and Krude,
2015), transcriptional regulation (by lncRNAs) (Long et al., 2017), alternative splicing
(by snRNAs) (Karijolich and Yu,
2010), RNA editing (by snoRNAs) (Vitali et al., 2005), and translation (by
rRNAs, Dahlberg, 1989,
and miRNAs, Fabian et al.,
2010).

Another support for our result is provided by the correlation between the increases
of the noncoding transcriptome and cognitive evolution in primates (Guennewig and Cooper,
2014). Such abundance of ncRNAs in developed PFC supports the pivotal role of
ncRNAs in adult brain functioning. However, experimental studies are needed to
determine if these changes in transcription of ncRNAs are cause or subsequence of
PFC development.

In addition to pivotal role of common biological processes in PFC (Table 3), some biological
processes were enriched in a region-specific manner (Table 4). Such processes can be considered
as a molecular signature for each region and may have a central role for
specification of the regions.

Table 4. Comparison of the Biological Processes Involved in the Development of
Distinct Regions of Human Prefrontal Cortex.



	
Note. The “−” and “//”denotes no enrichment of
biological process and the commonly enriched biological processes,
respectively. Each number in the column 1 denotes the developmental
transitions of 1–11. DFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; MFC = medial
prefrontal cortex; VFC = ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; OFC= orbital
frontal cortex; GAG = glycosaminoglycan; ECM = extracellular matrix.

As shown in Table 4,
among all regions, the OFC showed unique set of biological processes across initial
transitions (1–4) of PFC development: “Osteoblast differentiation,” “cell adhesion,”
“RNA-pol II regulation,” “Ureteric acid development,” “collagen fibril
organization,” and “ECM organization” (in Transition 1); mitosis processes, protein
metabolism, neuron differentiation inhibition, and oxygen transport (in Transition
3); and RNA-pol II activation (in Transition 4) (Table 4). Studies showed that among all
regions of PFC, the OFC receives environmental stimuli or experiences in early
developmental stages and accordingly formulates behavioral characteristics (Bachevalier and Loveland,
2006; Hanson et al.,
2010). Therefore, this unique set of biological processes which were
enriched for OFC may mediate such events.

In early stages of VFC development, the biological process of “axon guidance of
retinal ganglion cells” was specifically enriched (Table 4) which is consistent with the
positional proximity of VFC to the human retina (Romanski, 2007).

In developmental Transition 5 of PFC, the region-specific biological processes are
mainly linked to gene expression regulation, whose regulatory effects differ between
regions (Table 4; blue
highlighted). For example, enrichment of DNA methylation” and “mRNA splicing via
spliceosome” for MFC, “covalent chromatin modification” for VFC, and “regulation of
transcription from RNA-pol II” for OFC. Such varied regulatory systems could be the
causes of observed diverse transcription profile of each region in this
developmental transition (Figure
9). In addition, “cholesterol biosynthetic process” is a cellular event
of the Transition 5, which was enriched specifically for MFC and OFC (Table 4). Studies also
proved the relationship between cholesterol metabolism and central nervous system
development (L. Wang et al.,
2002; Xu et al.,
2014; Courtney and
Landreth, 2016).

During Transition 6 (the time of birth), while most biological processes are common
in all PFC regions, the biological processes of protein metabolism (“rRNA
processing,” “translational initiation,” “NMD,” and “signal recognition particle
[SRP]-mediated protein targeting to membrane”) were enriched for MFC, VFC, and OFC
but not DFC. In DFC, these processes emerge in Transition 7, suggesting existence of
different protein profile in each region of PFC.

In Transition 7, the common hallmark of all regions is balanced between cell
proliferation and neural differentiation. However, type and rate of cell
proliferation and differentiation are different across regions. Similarly, in
Transition 7, the biological process of cellular response to several stimuli is a
common characteristic of all regions but depending on the region, stimulus may be a
hormone, drug, wounding, or hypoxia (Table 4). According to these enriched
biological processes for Transition 7, a prominent event could be ‘neurogenesis’
which requires both cell proliferation (of neural stem or progenitor cells) and
differentiation under a tightly regulated process (Kirschenbaum et al., 1994). While it is
found that neurogenesis mostly occurs in HIP, studies showed that PFC also harbors
progenitor cells in which the neurogenesis can be induced by the aforementioned
stimuli (Fuchs, 2008).
Expression analysis of the neuronal cell markers also confirmed the active process
of neurogenesis during Transitions 5 to 11 (Figure 7(b)). In addition, among all PFC
regions, MFC and OFC were previously illustrated to be more influenced by
environmental stimuli. However, nearly always, their responses are in opposite
directions (Kolb et al.,
2012).

The Transition 8 contains many biological processes, commonly enriched for all
regions of PFC (Table
3). Nevertheless, the region-specific biological processes were mostly
related to nervous system activity and behavior. Interestingly, protein synthesis
and metabolism which were emerged and continued through the Transitions 6 and 7
become declined in the Transition 8 of MFC, VFC, and OFC (but not DFC) via processes
of protein degradation. As mentioned, translational initiation in DFC begins later
than that of other regions; expectedly, protein degradation is not enriched within
the DFC yet (Table
4).

Transitions 9 to 11 of PFC (from 5 to 40 years after birth) harbor the most
differential biological processes: In DFC, cell adhesion process is followed by
protein metabolism and cellular response to extracellular stimulus; in MFC, the
biological processes related to angiogenesis or vasculogenesis, ECM organization,
cell adhesion, cell proliferation, maturation, migration, and shaping (in Transition
9) are followed by negative regulation of growth and cellular response to zinc,
cadmium, and other metallic ions (in Transition 11). In VFC, other than the role of
protein metabolism processes in Transitions 9 and 10, three physiologically
important processes (i.e., Type-I interferon signaling pathway, regulation of blood
pressure, and mitochondrial electron transport) are emerged. In OFC, ECM
organization, cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and differentiation,
angiogenesis or vasculogenesis were observed, which also were in common with MFC.
However, cellular response to TGF-β stimulus, collagen catabolic process, gene
expression regulation (in Transition 9) together with “defense response to virus”
and “Type-I interferon signaling pathway” (in Transition 10) were unique.

In addition to comparison of two immediate developmental stages to acquire DEGs, the
lists of coexpressed genes during PFC development was obtained by WGCNA and DAVID
software predicted their corresponding biological processes. Many of the resultant
biological processes were similar to the results of DEG analysis, while other
processes were different (Figure
6).

We were interested to evaluate the transcriptome landscape of PFC during development.
To this purpose, biological processes related to RNA polymerase activity were
considered and scored based on their percentage (%) in the results of enrichment
analyses (Supplemental File S2 and Table 1). Analyses showed that in spite of
some deviations, global transcription rates of PFC regions during development have a
convergent but dynamic pattern (p < .05) (Figure 8(a)). The dynamic feature of PFC
transcriptome was also verified by the expression trajectories of three general TFs
(Figure 8(b)). Next, we
investigated if the global transcription rate affects number or FC values of DEGs.
The results showed no significant correlation between global transcription rate and
number or FCs of DEGs (Figure 8(c)
and (d)), suggesting that regulatory systems of global transcription
(e.g., RNA polymerases and their regulators) are not the effectors to change PFC
transcriptome. For this reason, we tried to find additional biological processes
that underlie dynamic feature of PFC transcriptome during development.
Interestingly, according to the enriched biological processes (Supplementary File
S2), a concordance between transcriptome landscape and several biological processes
was found (Figure 9). In
detail, the biological processes of “transcription termination” are simultaneous
with the decrease in number and FCs of DEGs in Transition 1 (Figure 9). The Transitions 5, 6, and 7
exhibited diverse transcriptome which are concurrent with regulatory mechanisms
which were particularly enriched in a region-specific manner. Such differential
regulatory systems confer a remarkable heterogeneity to transcriptomes of the PFC
regions in Transition 5 (Figure
9). During Transition 6, a more specific regulatory system is launched by
miRNAs and TFs. Although the terminology of such biological processes is common, but
each region may harbor different miRNAs or TFs which subsequently can confer a
different transcriptome to each region. Consistently, recent studies revealed
distinct profiles of miRNAs (Ziats and Rennert, 2014) and TFs (Pfaffenseller et al., 2016) across
developmental times and regions of human PFC. Like early stages of PFC development
(Transitions 1 to 4), latest stages of PFC development (Transitions 8 to 11) had
similar transcriptome dynamics (Figure 9).

In addition to the biological processes, several signaling pathways were also
identified for development of PFC (Table 2). Such profile of signaling
pathways is important specifically to speculate about the outcome(s) of
deregulations in any signaling pathway when human brain is developing (Kloet and Derijk, 2004;
Noelanders and Vleminckx,
2017). Moreover, the profile of signaling pathways may be helpful to
design a targeted system (e.g., drug, siRNA, etc.) against the deregulated pathways
to treat brain malformations (Lewandowski et al., 2016). An interesting instance is the causative role
of defective insulin signaling pathway in several brain disorder (Schubert et al., 2003;
Bedse et al., 2015)
which could be corrected by insulin treatment (Jolivalt et al., 2008; Folch et al., 2018). While
we showed that the studied PFC regions differ in their developmental processes and
signaling pathways, PCA results revealed that the transcriptome profiles of these
regions are not distinct (Figure
10(l)). To investigate the amount of similarities between PFC and other
brain regions in the view of their molecular mechanisms during development, the
lists of the DEGs for several brain regions were obtained from BrainSpan and were
analyzed by DAVID. Venn diagram analysis demonstrated a divergence profiles between
PFC and V1C, A1C, AMY, HIP, and CBC (Figure 10(k)). The degree of these
divergences is completely consistent with the results of another study which
compared the transcriptome of most human brain regions by PCA (Willsey et al., 2013). In this study we
exploited the available data sets of human PFC transcriptome to identify its
molecular event during development. It is of great importance to perform a similar
procedure for other parts of human brain.
