discussion boards/forums, persons’ experiences associated with the use of drugs
that alter androgen metabolism, such as finasteride. Finasteride is an orally
active, specific inhibitor of 5α-reductase, which is localized to many
androgen-dependent tissues. Finasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone
(T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and is commonly used to treat benign prostatic
hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (MPB), both disorders associated
with elevated DHT levels and 5α-reductase activity in the prostate and hair
follicles, respectively. It is now acknowledged that long-term use and
discontinuation of finasteride has adverse effects (AEs); however, these claims
have not been well documented. In this study, discussion board posts (forums)
were analyzed as self-reports of what finasteride users indicate is problematic
for them. Reports were categorized by the age of subjects as well as the types
of AEs described: antiandrogenic, estrogenic, central, and nonspecific/severe. A
total of 244 cases were recorded and analyzed on the discussion forum on
propeciahelp.com. Among these, 74 (32%) cases reported
antiandrogenic affects, 43 (19%) reported estrogenic effects, 70 (30%) reported
central effects, 11 (5%) reported nonspecific/severe AEs, and 31 (14%) reported
AEs in all categories. The categorization of AEs may prompt further
investigation into the pathophysiology of post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). Also,
subjective reports may engender greater understanding of the perceived lasting
AEs of finasteride.

Introduction: Current Research Findings Regarding Persistent Finasteride
Effects
Steroid hormones, including androgens, such as testosterone, exert many effects,
which may be due in part to actions of their metabolites. Androgens’ actions involve
its metabolism by 5α-reductase enzymes, which convert the body’s main androgen,
testosterone, to dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Kohtz & Frye, 2012). Finasteride is an
orally active, specific inhibitor of 5α-reductase, which is localized to many
androgen-dependent tissues. Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern
baldness (MPB; aka androgenic alopecia) are androgen-dependent disorders, associated
with high levels of DHT and increased 5α-reductase activities in prostate and hair
follicles, respectively. Both BPH and MPB respond favorably to treatment with
finasteride, with reductions in DHT and suppression of 5α-reductase (Traish, Melcangi, Bortolato,
Garcia-Segura, & Zitzmann, 2015a). There can also be considerable
adverse effects (AEs) of finasteride. These may be due to its nonspecific effects on
5α-reductase expression in reproductive organs, brain, and/or peripheral organs
(e.g., cardiovasculature). As well as altering 5α-reductase to reduce DHT, other
enzymes such as aromatase and its products, respond to finasteride therapy
(neurosteroids; Caruso et al.,
2015; Melcangi et
al., 2013). Castro-Magana and colleagues documented an inverse pattern
between P450 aromatase and 5α-reductase activities. It is hypothesized that DHT
inhibits aromatase and that finasteride is likely responsible for the moderate
increase in estrogens found in some patients on finasteride therapy (Castro-Magana
et al. 1996). Moreover, some AEs of finasteride may continue despite discontinuation
of finasteride. Post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) is a condition associated with
altered steroid levels and these varied AEs that persist after treatment cessation
(Ganzer, Jacobs, & Iqbal, 2014; Irwig, 2012a, 2012b, 2014a, 2014b; Irwig & Kolukula, 2011; Traish et al., 2015a, Traish, Haider, Doros, &
Haider, 2015b). These symptoms can range from mild to severe and can be
physical or psychological, including changes in sexual function, sleep/energy,
growth and/or shrinkage of tissues, in sensory processes, and/or higher cognitive
functions, including mood. Simply, there is general functional decline following
finasteride usage among some men.

One way to understand symptoms following finasteride treatment and its
discontinuation is to assess subjective reports. Many individuals blog about their
experiences on propeciahelp.com (and other websites). A recently published study
used a survey method to characterize this constellation of symptoms in men that used
finasteride to treat MPB, and stopped taking the drug for at least 3 months prior to
assessment (of symptoms) (Ganzer
et al., 2015). The Internet-based survey that was emailed to participants
(N = 131, mean age of 24, range 21–62) who reported
experiencing symptoms of AEs of finasteride, targeted six domains: (a) physical
symptoms, (b) sexual libido, (c) ejaculatory disorders, (d) disorders of the penis
and testes, (e) cognitive symptoms, and (f) psychological symptoms. The majority of
the sample reported several symptoms across domains that they believed was
associated with their past finasteride use. A striking physical symptom, reported by
91 individuals (or 70% of the sample) was gynecomastia (irreversible enlargement of
the breasts). Other physical symptoms reported by nearly 70% of the sample was
lethargy/fatigue and dry, thinning skin. Changes in muscle strength and changes in
metabolism/fat deposition were reported in the majority of subjects (56% and 54%,
respectively). As for three domains associated with sexual function (sexual libido,
ejaculatory disorders, and disorders of the penis and testes), nearly all subjects
reported negative changes in libido (93%), loss of morning erections (89%), erectile
dysfunction (83%), and negative changes in ejaculation (82%). Penile and scrotal
shrinkage and loss of sensation were reported by approximately 80% of subjects.
Anhedonia (loss of pleasure) in sex and in general was reported in about 70% of
subjects. The most commonly reported cognitive symptoms were: slowed thought
processes (74%), mental cloudiness/“brain fog” (75%), and attentional difficulties
(74%). Confusion and severe memory recall impairment were also reported in more than
50% of subjects. As for psychological symptoms, elevated anxiety and depressed
affect were reported in many subjects, 73% and 74% of the sample, respectively.
Sleep disturbance was reported among a significant number of subjects (58%). As
well, suicide ideation or feeling hopelessness regarding coping with the AEs of
finasteride on a daily basis was reported among 82, or 68%, of the respondents.
Simply, the results from this study demonstrated that there were persistent AEs in
each of the six domains assessed and, thereby, showing support for the presence of
both physical and psychological changes following finasteride use. This is
significant because the intended use of finasteride is for physical symptoms
associated with androgens, that is, hair loss and/or prostate hyperplasia. Albeit,
laboratories studying the role of brain 5α-reductase for androgen action, and
finasteride as a tool to alter metabolism or neurosteroid synthesis in the brain,
have been using finasteride as a pharmacological tool in animal models for decades
(e.g., Frau et al., 2013;
Ford, Nickel, & Finn,
2005; Frye, Scalise,
& Bayon, 1998; Frye & Walf, 2002; Serra, Sanna, Mostallino, & Biggio,
2007).

In the present report, our aim was to categorize the nature of these physical and
psychological effects. This report briefly details a similar pattern of responses
when using another approach to describe the types and incidence of symptoms in the
same online forum, propeciahelp.com. Looking at
these subjective reports, which were provided anonymously and spontaneously (i.e.,
not in response to direct questioning in a survey or from a clinician) may provide
important information for the greater understanding of the perceived AEs of
finasteride. As such, 224 discussions on propeciahelp.com forum were
collected from a discrete time period and were analyzed and categorized based on
self-reports into antiandrogenic (demasculinizing), estrogenic (feminizing),
central/brain effects, and nonspecific/severe AEs (i.e., those not falling into
these other three categories).

Methods: Design and Data Collection
This project was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at
University at Albany, SUNY (Albany, NY). Information from discussion forums, sampled
from Fall 2012, publically available on the Web, about self-reports of effects of
finasteride were recorded and analyzed. This discrete time period was utilized
because it coincided with the months when an undergraduate research assistant was
being mentored on this project.

In general, reports of AEs were categorized as antiandrogenic, estrogenic, central,
and nonspecific/severe AEs. A description of these and specific examples are
provided in Table 1.
Demasculinizing (antiandrogenic) effects occur due to androgen (specifically DHT)
deprivation of the sexual organs. Feminizing (estrogenic) effects occur due to
increased estrogen activity. Central/brain effects occur due to inhibition of
5α-reductase and other enzymes/products, reduced levels of neurosteroids or cerebral
thromboembolic events. Nonspecific/severe AEs are side effects that were vague but
still serious; this category was utilized to note other AEs that could not be
considered clearly antiandrogenic, estrogenic, or central/brain effects. These
categorical definitions provided the criteria to analyze and group the self-reports
systematically. The reports were assessed and categorized by two individuals (the
research assistant, AD, and mentor, CAF). When it was disclosed, the age of the
blogger was reported.

Findings
The majority of posts that were analyzed did not indicate the age of the individual
who was self-reporting (141, or 63% of 244 total cases reviewed). In the cases where
an age was indicated, few cases of the samples were from the age groups 10–19 or 40+
years of age (n = 4 or 6, respectively). Of those cases in which
age was reported, 49 (59% of 83 cases) were in the 20–29 age group and 24 (29%) were
in the 30–39 age group. Of the 244, there were 20 posts that did not report their
age or AEs of finasteride (8% of the sample); the vast majority of posts indicated
AEs (Table 2).

subset of individuals reported AEs that fell into all of the categories (31% or
14%).

Discussion: Recommendations For Further Study and Categorization of Persistent
Finasteride Effects
The present report describes a constellation of symptoms following use and
discontinuation of finasteride. The antiandrogenic AEs included genital dysfunction,
testicular function and infertility, accessory sexual or genitourinary organ
dysfunction, psychosexual function, and hormonal function. The estrogenic AEs
included breast cancer, breast neoplasm or breast mass, gynecomastia, breast pain,
and increased blood estrogen levels. The central effects consisted of depression,
anxiety, confusion/“brain fog,” and sleep and attentional problems. The
nonspecific/severe AEs consist of muscle twitching, lower back pain, weight gain,
fatigue, numbness in the anal region, muscle spasms, excessive sweating, bleeding
gums, tinnitus, hot flashes, irregular stool, scoliosis, and discoloration of the
urine. In some individuals, there were reports of AEs from all these categories.
Importantly, this study corroborates another using self-reports as discussed in the
Introduction (see (Ganzer et
al., 2015) as well as other methods to begin to characterize symptoms
after finasteride is discontinued as described in the next paragraphs.

Other approaches have been utilized to assess these AEs among patients, showing
converging evidence about the nature of the AEs of finasteride use that can persist
after discontinuation. Antiandrogenic effects, generally considered sexual side
effects, can include an overall decrease in libido/sexual drive, erectile and
ejaculatory dysfunctions, and negative physical and sensory changes to the penis and
scrotum and have been reported in previous studies (Carbone & Hodges, 2003; McClellan & Markham,
1999; Irwig,
2012b, 2014;
Irwig & Kolukula,
2011; Mella, Perret,
Manzotti, Catalano, & Guyatt, 2010; Traish, Hassani, Guay, Zitzmann, & Hansen,
2011; Traish et al.,
2015a, 2015b).
A prospective study of otherwise healthy men, 40 years old and younger
(N = 54) who reported persistent AEs of finasteride, showed
that sexual symptoms endured in many respondents at assessments at 3, 9, and 16
months following drug discontinuation (Irwig, 2012b). The estrogenic effects,
including gynecomastia, are not new and were reported about 20 years ago by Kaufman
and colleagues (Kaufman et al.,
1998) as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although a
benign condition, gynecomastia may cause substantial anxiety and discomfort;
however, it is a commonly overlooked AE by practicing clinicians. This is one
example where a physical AE may contribute to a psychological AE. Although the aim
of this study was to assess the occurrence of both physical and psychological
symptoms, other work needs to be done to determine the relationships between
these.

The central effects associated with the use of finasteride, include cognitive and
affective/psychological changes. Yet, these effects are not well studied compared to
AEs on sexual function, partly because of the implicit, but incorrect, assumption
that finasteride does not target brain 5α-reductase. As in the present report, the
self-reported central symptoms can include mental cloudiness, difficulties with
attention/focus, and memory problems (Ganzer et al., 2015). There is also
evidence of finasteride altering other complex cognitive behaviors, such as
motivation and reward. This has been observed in case studies and clinical reports
showing that finasteride can reduce symptoms across different neuropsychiatric or
neurodegenerative disorders (reviewed in Traish et al., 2015; Paba et al., 2011). For example,
finasteride reduced, tics, a major symptom, in Tourette Syndrome (Muroni, Paba, Puligheddu, Marrosu,
& Bortolato, 2011). In another case study, problem gambling (as a
potential adverse effect of treatment for Parkinson’s disease with dopaminergic
agents) was reduced with finasteride administration (Bortolato et al., 2012). These studies
demonstrate direct evidence to suggest that finasteride has effects on 5α-reductase
in the brain.

There is also ample evidence of adverse psychological or mood effects of finasteride
following its discontinuation. In the recently published pilot study using a survey
method to characterize psychological (and other) symptoms in men who used
finasteride to treat MPB, the cohort reported high rates of psychological symptoms
(Ganzer et al.,
2015); these effects are much like what we report here using a different
approach. Moreover, a recent report has corroborated and extended these results to
assess specifically mood symptoms (Ganzer & Jacobs, 2016). Further, in a
clinical study, significantly increased depression symptoms and suicidality were
reported by three-quarters of the subject group that had discontinued finasteride,
compared to about 10% of the control group (Irwig, 2012a). Among patients that have
discontinued finasteride treatment, there was depression, mood disturbances, and
changes in steroid levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (Melcangi et al., 2013). Another study
evaluated the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, irreversible suppression of
SRD5A1 (5α-reductase gene), off-target suppression of androgen receptor (AR) action,
effects on brain regions that regulate sexual function and mood, cognitive function,
and sexual function in symptomatic finasteride users, asymptomatic finasteride
users, and a control group (healthy men under 50 years of age; Basaria et al. 2016).
Overall, Basaria et al. found no hormonal or genetic correlate as the causative
factor for PFS. However, they observed subjective differences in personality/mood,
sexual function, and cognitive function. Importantly, neural activity as determined
by functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent (fMRI BOLD)
activity, showed abnormal neural activity in regions associated with sexual function
and major depression only in symptomatic finasteride users. Based on the
comprehensive assessment by Basaria et al., it is likely that PFS may be due to a
persistent rewiring of neural circuitry that may or may not have a hormonal
correlate. Thus, these studies in people show that there are physical and central
effects of finasteride that can be persistent, and the hormonal correlates have been
hinted at and need further investigation.

In summary, these studies show that there can be effects of finasteride for both
physical and psychological indices. Yet, there are potential limitations of this
study that cannot be ignored. There may have been selection and recall biases from
recruiting subjects who had sought treatment for symptoms from a website; it is
unknown whether comments are only in response to others’ comments on the forum.
Also, the self-reports assessed here were specifically used to address questions of
spontaneous subjective reporting by not using typical laboratory or clinical methods
(which may have their own biases to account for) to study the symptoms of the men
with PFS. The accuracy of self-reports must be considered mainly because AEs could
be due to other reasons that are not PFS and without clinical assessments
individuals may misdiagnose/describe inaccurately AEs. Additionally, we are not able
to directly link these effects to hormone levels (e.g., it is not known if
estrogenic effects are due to high estradiol levels or changes in the ratio of
androgens to estrogens). It would be of use to extend this work in future studies
that could use validated instruments such as those available for sexual function,
depression, anxiety, general overall health, and so on, and hormonal measurements
(and which have been reported on elsewhere). Recent research has turned to study the
long-term effects of finasteride, or how these occur post-discontinuation. Part of
this may be due to the inadequacy of clinical trials (e.g., as reviewed by Mella et al., 2010).
Indeed, despite this evidence, there is little mention regarding the potential AEs
in the Propecia product insert. However, it should be noted that these findings have
led to prompting the FDA to mandate that the labeling of Propecia to include
information about potential risks of depression as well as sexual function problems
and high-grade prostate cancer (FDA, 2010; Traish et
al., 2015a). These studies also provide support for the notion that some
men respond poorly to levels of endogenous circulating androgens (e.g., those with
MPB and BPH) and/or their manipulation with finasteride administration (e.g., those
with PFS symptoms). Additional considerations that may underlie individual
differences in responses to finasteride are subject variables, such as the degree of
brain lateralization and cognitive style (reviewed in Motofei et al., 2017, 2016a, 2016b). A proxy for brain lateralization,
which can reflect cognitive style, is handedness. Although the present study did not
account for this, another study demonstrated that short-term finasteride treatment
for male pattern baldness had opposite effects on changes in sexual functioning in
right- and left-handed subjects (Motofei et al., 2013). Among subjects who reported differences in sexual
functioning scores after treatment compared to before treatment, right-handed
individuals reported worsening of sexual function, whereas left-handed individuals
reported improvements (Motofei
et al., 2013). Future work should continue to assess the varied AEs
associated with altering androgen metabolism or action, such as these effects
described herein on finasteride, as well as other pharmacotherapies.
