Abstract

Aim

We conducted a chart review to investigate the detailed outcomes of patients with schizophrenia who discontinued long‐acting injectable second‐generation antipsychotic (LAI‐SGA) therapy due to adverse events (AEs).

Methods

The study included patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders who commenced LAI‐SGA therapy between January/1//2009 and March/31/2020 at Fujita Health University Hospital in Toyoake, Japan.

Results

We conducted a chart review of 157 patients with schizophrenia. At the time of this survey, 4 (6.9%), 5 (12.2%), and 10 (17.2%) of the patients in the aripiprazole once monthly, paliperidone palmitate, and risperidone‐LAI groups, respectively, discontinued due to AEs since the start of LAI‐SGA therapy. Three patients required hospitalization for AE treatment.

Conclusion

The severity of these AEs in most patients is moderate (ie, no hospital treatment required). Due to the small sample size, a larger study is needed to confirm/replicate our study results.

pmc1 INTRODUCTION

Our retrospective chart review study reported that 39 (24.8%) of the 157 study patients discontinued their long‐acting injectable second‐generation antipsychotic [LAI‐SGA] therapy aripiprazole once monthly (AOM, n = 58), paliperidone palmitate (PP, n = 41), and risperidone (RIS‐LAI, n = 58) within 6 months of starting.1 Eleven (7.0%) patients discontinued due to adverse events (AEs). LAI‐SGAs, therefore, appear to have favorable acceptability and tolerability for patients with schizophrenia in clinical practice. However, a cross‐sectional study reported that more than 50% of psychiatrists believed that the AEs are more severe for LAI antipsychotics than for oral SGAs.2 The recent review article investigating psychiatrists' attitudes toward LAI antipsychotics reported that although most psychiatrists believed that LAI antipsychotics are proven to prevent schizophrenia relapse compared with oral antipsychotics, some psychiatrists are reluctant to use LAI antipsychotics due to concerns about the safety of LAI antipsychotics.3 Therefore, we conducted an additional chart review to investigate the detailed outcomes of patients with schizophrenia who discontinued LAI‐SGA therapy due to AEs.

2 METHODS

The study included patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders who commenced LAI‐SGA therapy between January/1//2009 and March/31//2020 at Fujita Health University Hospital in Toyoake, Japan. This study focused on the patients in the AOM, PP, and RIS‐LAI groups who discontinued the therapy due to AEs between the start of therapy and the time of this survey. The final chart review was performed on May/2//2021. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fujita Health University. Informed consent was obtained via an opt‐out form on the website and in‐hospital bulletin board. Patients with unknown start times for LAI‐SGA therapy or who declined to participate were excluded. The age at the start of therapy, age at AE onset, sex, therapy duration, and treatment status were collected. If there was more than one reason, we confirmed the most appropriate reason with the patients’ primary doctors or selected the most relevant reason.

3 RESULTS

We conducted a chart review of 157 patients with schizophrenia. At the time of this survey, 4 (6.9%), 5 (12.2%), and 10 (17.2%) of the patients in the AOM, PP, and RIS‐LAI groups, respectively, discontinued due to AEs since the start of LAI‐SGA therapy. Table 1 lists the patients' characteristics and their outcomes after discontinuing LAI‐SGA therapy. One patient in the AOM group (rhabdomyolysis) and 2 in the RIS‐LAI group (both were akathisia) required hospitalization for AE treatment. Given that the patient with rhabdomyolysis was associated with severe dehydration and severe respiratory infection, the association between rhabdomyolysis and AOM is unclear. This patient did not meet 3 major diagnostic criteria for neuroleptic malignant syndrome4, 5, 6 and was, therefore, not administered dantrolene. With fluid replacement, the patient recovered in approximately 1 week. Because the patient had poor medication adherence, the patient was administered injectable RIS‐LAI after confirming tolerability with oral RIS for approximately 2 weeks. One patient with severe akathisia was administered injectable RIS‐LAI without confirming tolerability for oral RIS. The patient was administered anticholinergic agents after admission, and the symptoms improved within a few days. Another patient's akathisia symptoms were difficult to distinguish from agitation. Although the patient was administered an anticholinergic agent after admission, the akathisia symptoms did not notably improve. The patient refused oral or injectable antipsychotic treatment and was transferred to another hospital within a few days after admission to our hospital. The AEs in the other patients required no hospital treatment. The other AOM patients’ reasons for discontinuation were extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 1) and injection‐site pain (n = 2). The PP patients’ reasons for discontinuation were akathisia (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), weight gain (n = 2), and injection‐site pain (n = 1). The other RIS‐LAI patients’ reasons for discontinuation were extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 1), akathisia (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), hyperprolactinemia (n = 3), and injection‐site pain (n = 2). Nine of the 19 patients had their medication replaced with other LAI‐SGAs. The patients who discontinued LAI‐SGA due to injection‐site pain were returned to the oral medication that they took before the LAI‐SGA therapy.

* Moderate; discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant investigation. Severe: incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affect clinical status, and warrants intervention.

4 DISCUSSION

Our study suggests that although LAI‐SGAs have a risk of AEs, the severity of these AEs in most patients is moderate (ie, no hospital treatment required). There were several limitations to this study. Due to the small sample size, we did not perform a statistical analysis to examine the association between AE incidence/severity and the clinical factors. A larger study is needed to confirm/replicate our study results. Because a recent network meta‐analysis showed that a 3‐month PP formulation prevented schizophrenia relapse,7 the effectiveness of this LAI‐AP should be confirmed in clinical practice.
