Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) individuals, organizations, and tribes to
mistrust health research. To build trust and repair relationships, current
research with AIAN peoples often involves participatory research (PR)
approaches. This article assesses community-level protections described in the
scientific literature on PR involving AIAN communities. A scoping review search
in PubMed and PsychInfo for articles published between January 2000 and June
2017 yielded an AIAN PR article dataset. Of 178 articles, a subset of 23
articles that described aspects of community protections were analyzed for
descriptions of community-level protection practices. We identified the presence
or absence of a description of four community protection measures in each
article: a tribal research department, the development of community-level
mechanisms for research regulation if not present, community collaboration
throughout the research process, and project employment of a community member.
The development of community-level mechanisms for research regulation was
described in 39% of the articles. Ninety-one percent of these articles described
community collaboration during the research process. Seventeen percent included
descriptions of all four community-level protection measures. The extent and
consistency to which community-level protections are described is variable; the
current literature lacks reporting on community-level protection practices
specific to tribal communities.

1. Introduction
Indigenous populations worldwide have been subjected to research and research
practices that fail to address the priorities and health needs of Indigenous
communities (Valeggia and Snodgrass 2015;
Garrison et al. 2019). Unethical and
unregulated research practices with Indigenous populations have led to the
development of local, national and international Indigenous-driven frameworks such
as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples that clarify
the ethical and legal rights of Indigenous people in research (United Nations General Assembly 2007). Research involving
human participants in the United States (US) is guided by federal regulations that
require researchers to respect participant autonomy, treat participants fairly, and
maximize benefits and minimize harms to participants (Department of Health, Education and Welfare 2014).
Although these regulations provide broad protections for individual research
participants, they fail to address communityor population-level ethical concerns.
When federal regulation standards alone are considered for research protections,
leeway exists for research activities that can inadvertently harm communities (Mariella et al. 2009).

Research approaches that promote community participation emerged from the
need to address gaps in community-level research protections. A community is more
than a group of individuals with shared characteristics: communities also possess an
internal structure with identifiable leadership (Ross et al. 2010). Additionally, communities are subject to group-level
benefits and harms consequent to the participation of its members in research. In
health research for example, if a study design calls for recruitment of individual
participants from a community of interest and the research takes place within that
specific community, then risks of harm extend beyond the individual to the community
as a whole and must be considered. Extending consideration of such harms from the
individuals to the communities involved in health research requires the involvement
of communities in the research process (Gbadegesin
and Wendler 2006).

Participatory research (PR) approaches seek not only to prevent harm, but to
actively benefit communities by reimagining the relationship between researchers and
participants through the realignment of research goals with community priorities and
needs. PR is characterized by a shared commitment to methods that empower and
measurably benefit communities through engagement processes, developing capacity,
and ceding control of specific research activities to the community (Fisher and Ball 2003; Baum
et al. 2006; Israel 2013).
Community involvement, a central component of PR, seeks to mitigate inherent power
imbalances between researchers and research participants and democratizes
decision-making within the research process (Israel
et al. 2001; Fisher and Ball 2003;
Baum et al. 2006).

1.1. Tribal Groups in the US
In the US, tribal groups have several designations that revolve around
formal recognition—federal recognition, state recognition and tribes
seeking recognition. Federally recognized tribes refer to tribes that have met
the US federal regulatory requirements described in 25 C.F.R. §83. These
requirements include documentation of the AIAN identity of the group, that the
group has a long-standing history as a community, the group has a political
structure, and the group has governing documents and unique membership
requirements (US Government Publishing O ce
2017). Through federal acknowledgement, the US formally recognizes
the tribes right to self-govern, enforce laws, and regulate activities inclusive
of health research. In addition to recognizing and promoting an inherent right
to self-governance for tribal communities, federally recognized tribes are
eligible for services to protect and enhance tribal lands and to improve the
well-being of AIAN people as part of the trust responsibility of the US
government established in formal government-to-government relations (US Government Publishing Office 2017).
Currently, there are 573 federally recognized tribes in the US and over 200
tribes seeking federal recognition (Koenig and
Steinberg 2008; US Department of
Health and Human Services 2018). Of the over 200 tribes seeking
federal recognition, there are over 63 state recognized tribes that have
established formal state government relations. State recognition acknowledges
the cultural and political history of the tribe and, in some cases, qualifies
tribes for federal and state support (Salazar
2016). The formal recognition processes by the US federal and state
governments highlight the distinct political designation of AIAN groups in the
US and the unique ethical considerations this context holds for health
research.

1.2. Research in US Tribal Contexts
US federal policy enacted to assimilate AIAN communities and eliminate
AIAN cultures has contributed to a legacy of mistrust in federally funded health
care for AIAN communities (Hodge 2012;
Rhoades and Rhoades 2014; Warne and Frizzell 2014). This mistrust is
compounded by the varied experiences of research among tribal communities. For
example, in 1979, an AN community sought assistance from researchers in
addressing community concerns with alcohol (Foulks 1989). Although the project embraced collaboration between
researchers and the community, study findings stigmatizing the AN community were
published, without community approval, in a national media outlet (Foulks 1989). In a similar vein, in 1990,
Arizona State University researchers were asked by members of an Arizona tribe to
investigate the high incidence of diabetes within the tribe (Garrison 2013). Tribal members provided consent and
blood samples for diabetes research. Unbeknownst to the participants and
community, the samples were also used in controversial studies on the topics of
schizophrenia, migration, and consanguinity—unrelated to diabetes (Mello and Wolf 2010; Garrison 2013). These deplorable research practices
led not only to stigmatization of the AIAN communities where the research took
place, but also to many AIAN people and communities throughout the US
contributing to a negative view of health research in tribal communities.

Research in tribal contexts must also consider the sovereign status of
tribal governments (Quinn 1990). AIAN
tribes maintained their own forms of government prior to European contact and
prior to the establishment of the US as a country—many AIAN tribes
continue governing their citizens today. The US federal government recognizes
the sovereignty of many AIAN tribes, which places AIAN individuals,
organizations, and tribes in a unique political position (Quinn 1990). Sovereignty endows tribal governments
with inherent authority over a range of research activities involving tribal
members, including determination of research objectives and review of
manuscripts prior to publication. Thus, researchers and research institutions
must approach tribes as governments and recognize the legal force of tribal
regulations on research (Fisher and Ball
2005).

Last, the diversity of AIAN communities must be acknowledged. There are
573 federally recognized AIAN tribes and over 63 state-recognized tribes in the
US (US Department of Health and Human Services
2018) with distinct languages, cultures, health services
infrastructures, public health and health care needs (Goins et al. 2011). Research must be conducted with
and for AIAN communities utilizing methods adapted for their specific needs. For
AIAN communities, participation in research activities, including the
interpretation and dissemination of research findings, acts as a bulwark against
misrepresentation and potential stigmatization (Baum et al. 2006). While there are several forms of PR in current
practice, this review focuses on two approaches frequently used in research with
tribal communities.

1.3. Community-Based Participatory Research
Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been successfully
utilized by researchers in partnership with AIAN communities(BlueBirdJernigan2010; Cumminsetal.2010; Burhansstipanov et
al. 2013; Jumper-Reeves et al.
2014; Johansson et al. 2015).
CBPR aims to benefit communities by aligning research objectives with community
needs and by promoting the participation of community members in every stage of
the research process (Israel 2013). CBPR
is further distinguished by recognition of the community—rather than the
individual—as the primary unit of identity, a focus on co-learning among
both community members and researchers, and the development of community
research capacity (Goins et al. 2011;
Israel 2013). Additional guiding
principles of CBPR include reliance on an ecological perspective that accounts
for locally relevant social determinants of health and a balanced pursuit of
research and intervention in order to maximize benefits for all members of the
research collaboration (LaVeaux and Christopher
2009; Israel 2013).

1.4. Tribal Participatory Research
Although successful projects have been conducted using CBPR approaches
in health research with AIAN communities, it has been recognized that CBPR
principles alone do not address the needs and political status unique to AIAN
communities (LaVeaux and Christopher
2009; Mariella et al. 2009).
Tribal Participatory Research (TPR) acknowledges key features specific to AIAN
communities which include the history of tribal interactions with the US
government and researchers, the sovereign status of tribal governments, and the
diversity among AIAN populations (Fisher and
Ball 2003). Others have contributed to the development of this
research approach specific to AIAN communities (Mariella et al. 2009; Christopher et
al. 2011; Claw et al.
2018).

Like CBPR, TPR emphasizes community participation in the research
process and the development of community research capacity through training
community members in research methods (Fisher
and Ball 2003; Mariella et al.
2009; Claw et al. 2018).
However, TPR deliberately recognizes the historical and political experiences of
AIAN people and communities that contribute to contemporary public health
issues. TPR posits that understanding tribal communities’ history and
political standing provides a necessary cultural context to the conduct of a
research project, interpretation of data, and dissemination of study findings
(Fisher and Ball 2003; Christopher et al. 2011; Claw et al. 2018).

Further, TPR explicitly incorporates the recognition of tribal
sovereignty by adhering to tribal research oversight processes, including
research resolutions, tribal research oversight committees, and the development
of research codes (Fisher and Ball 2003;
Mariella et al. 2009; Claw et al. 2018). Like CBPR, community participation
is promoted in TPR to facilitate equitable power relations between researchers
and community members (Fisher and Ball
2003; Christopher et al.
2011). The TPR framework describes the necessity for tribal data
governance, oversight of data sharing and dissemination (Mariella et al. 2009). This recognition of tribal
sovereignty instills the understanding that AIAN individuals, organizations, and
tribes represent not only a distinct culture and background, but also a distinct
political designation and standing. Additionally, TPR reminds researchers of the
expertise community members have in the cultural and political context relevant
to data collected in their communities (Christopher et al. 2011; Claw et al.
2018).

As in CBPR, the dissemination of research findings back to the community
is a key aspect; but in recognition of the sovereign status of AIAN tribal
groups, TPR explicitly describes the requirement for tribal oversight of
publications prior to peer-review journal submission as well as prior review for
other modes of dissemination such as abstracts and presentations (Mariella et al. 2009; Claw et al. 2018). Finally, like CBPR, TPR supports
the development of community research capacity and emphasizes the use of
culturally appropriate measures, interventions, and outcomes (Fisher and Ball 2003; Christopher et al. 2011; Claw et al.
2018).

TPR offers an explicit framework under the umbrella of CBPR for
recognizing tribal sovereignty and engaging with the political processes unique
to research with AIAN communities. Within the context of the US, AIAN groups are
often clumped together as one group despite the cultural and political
differences previously outlined. Researchers with limited to no knowledge of
AIAN historical and political nuance may be unaware of specific protocols or
processes that exist within AIAN communities. This lack of knowledge could pose
a risk to the AIAN community in which the research takes place and could extend
to other AIAN groups as well. The TPR framework provides detailed guidance in
addressing the political and cultural considerations of a
government-to-government relationship that could be missed under the guidance of
CBPR alone.

1.5. Community-Protection Descriptions in PR in AIAN Communities
PR approaches, such as CBPR and TPR, were developed in part as a
response to unethical research practices that harmed or failed to benefit
communities participating in research. Unsurprisingly then, the literature
frequently describes PR in terms of its effectiveness as a strategy for
addressing these concerns. Although frameworks and approaches such as CBPR and
TPR exist, and researchers broadly report following PR guidelines, providing
documentation of explicit examples of how these approaches are applied not only
holds the researcher accountable for abiding by PR practices, but models
transparent research practices and further empowers AIAN communities that
participate in research by explicating their oversight of the research project.
This article examines the inclusion of community-level protection descriptions
in the scientific literature on participatory health research involving AIAN
communities.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Context for Scoping Review on PR with AIAN Communities
The Center for the Ethics of Indigenous Genomic Research (CEIGR) is a
Center of Excellence in the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications of Research
in the US. The University of Oklahoma collaborated with three AIAN community
research groups in the US to form CEIGR. The AIAN community research groups
include: Southcentral Foundation in Anchorage, Alaska; the Chickasaw Nation
Department of Health in Ada, Oklahoma; and Missouri Breaks Industries Research
Incorporated in Eagle Butte, South Dakota. The work of CEIGR is supported by an
external advisory committee comprised of researchers and clinicians with
experience on research and health care with AIAN populations. As CEIGR and the
external advisory committee began dialogue during the initiation of the center,
the group became aware of the different forms of PR practiced by the various
members of CEIGR. To come to a shared understanding and to review the space
where CEIGR work would be placed, the group recognized the need for a review of
PR with AIAN communities. This scoping review was conducted by AIAN researchers
and AIAN-based research staff. This manuscript was reviewed and approved by
Southcentral Foundation and Chickasaw Nation research pre-publication review
committees.

2.2. Scoping Review
Scoping studies seek to rapidly map key concepts in a research area to
identify strengths and gaps in the literature, determine the need for systematic
reviews, and inform policy, practice, and/or research (Arksey and O’malley 2005; Levac et al. 2010). This scoping study used a
five-stage framework which included: (1) determining the study question and
purpose; (2) developing and conducting the search strategy; (3) selecting
articles for extraction; (4) charting of data; (5) collating, summarizing, and
reporting results (Arksey and O’malley
2005; Levac et al. 2010).
Expert consultation was incorporated throughout all five stages of the scoping
study.

PubMed and PsychINFO were searched for articles published between 1
January 2000 and 30 June 2017 that contained Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
terms or keywords related to both AIAN populations in the US and PR.
Topic-related search terms included: “community based participatory
research”, “community engagement”, “participatory
action research”, “community institutional relations”,
“community participation”, and “action research.”
Population-related search terms included: “Alaska Natives”,
“Inuits”, and “Indians, North American”,
“Indigenous, North American”, “American Indian”, and
“Native American.” All fields were searched for these keywords.
Results were not limited by document type. Articles and journals were
recommended for inclusion by researchers and subject matter experts (SMEs)
within CEIGR and the CEIGR external advisory committee which included
non-indexed Indigenous journals and articles. These searches, in combination
with articles recommended by SMEs, yielded 4188 unique documents (Figure 1). Two researchers (R.B.W. and T.S.K.), with a
third as moderator (V.Y.H.) to resolve disputes, conducted article review,
selection, and data charting. Articles were reviewed and screened for relevance
to topics, approaches, and populations of interest through successive reviews of
article title, keywords, and abstract. Next, articles were sorted by type and
topic limited to articles describing primary research on health-related topics.
During article review, only articles based in the US were included and all
others were removed. SMEs were consulted in the development of search
strategies, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the data charting form.

A form was developed to guide the data charting process that included 60
fields, 44 of which related to the principles of CBPR, TPR and other key PR
approaches. Fields were marked as either description present or absent.
Reviewers consulted one another in cases of uncertainty to account for the
variability in how community settings and research processes are described in
the literature. If marked present, this indicates the article included a
description of the field of interest. If marked absent, this indicated that the
article did not include a description of the field of interest. It should be
noted that a determination of absence does not mean that the action was not
carried out, only that it was not reported in the published article. Once data
charting was complete, the dataset was cleaned in preparation for analysis
(Figure 1). The resultant dataset
included 178 articles that reported on the use Soc. Sci.
2019, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 18 of PR
approaches in primary research on health-related topics involving AIAN
people.

2.3. Analysis of Ethics of PR in AIAN Communities
Since PR was developed in part to protect the community from research
harm, we assessed the inclusion Since PR was developed in part to protect the
community from research harm, we assessed the of descriptions of adherence to PR
principles in research studies conducted with AIAN inclusion of descriptions of
adherence to PR principles in research studies conducted with AIAN communities
(Table 1). The dataset of 178
articles for the PR scoping review was screened to include only communities
(Table 1). The dataset of 178
articles for the PR scoping review was screened to include those only those that
had the presence of all the following selection criteria:

Community group involved in research project.

Community-level decision-making power over the research
project.

Ongoing input from community members for project described.

Tribal-level regulation over research project.

Relationships established between community and researchers
prior to project initiation.

Relationships between community and researchers maintained
beyond project conclusion.

From the 60 fields available in the charted data of the scoping review
described above, J.A.B., under the direction of V.Y.H., selected the criteria
based on CBPR and TPR principles outlined in Table 1. It is important to note that TPR includes the CBPR
principles outlined and also encompasses the additional principles of
recognizing tribal sovereignty and the authority this carries in research
oversight and data governance, as well as, recognizing the cultural diversity of
AIAN people. Table 1 shows the alignment
of the selection criteria with specific CBPR and/or TPR principles with an
“X”.

We then assessed the 23 articles that met the inclusion criteria of
involving the presence of the descriptions of key principles of CBPR and TPR
(Table 1). Within the 23 articles, we
documented the presence or absence of descriptions of activities related to
community protection: (a) tribal research department (b) the development of
community-level mechanism for regulating research if not present, (c) community
collaboration throughout the research process, and (d) project employment of a
community member.

2.4. Measures
All articles meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed for further
descriptions of community-level involvement. Research Approach
was categorized as utilizing PR, CBPR, and/or TPR (Table 2). We categorized the Research
Setting as either rural or urban. Rural included settings
describing reservations, and/or villages in Alaska and rural tribal communities
to be inclusive of state-recognized tribes that do not have reservations. The
presence of Tribal Research Department was used to indicate a
degree of familiarity with the research process. Yes (Y) was marked if the
article explicitly reported that the participating community had a tribal
research department or if information presented in the article
strongly suggested that the participating community had a tribal research
department. No (N) was marked if the article explicitly reported that the
participating community did not have a tribal research department
or if information presented in the article strongly
suggested that the participating community did not have a tribal research
department. Not Reported (NR) was recorded if the article did not report whether
the community had a tribal research department and if the
article did not present information that strongly suggested that the
participating community had or did not have a tribal research department.

For the column, Development of community-level mechanism for
regulating research if not present (Table 2), a “Y” response referred to articles that
explicitly stated research partners assisted in the development of a tribal
mechanism for regulating research or if information presented
in the article strongly suggested that the research partners engaged in this
activity. An “N” referred to articles explicitly stating that
research partners did not assist in the development of a tribal mechanism for
regulating research or if information presented in the article
strongly suggested that the research partners did not engage in this activity.
Responses of “NR” were entered if the article did not report
whether research partners assisted in the development of tribal mechanisms for
regulating research and if the article did not present
information that strongly suggested that the research partners engaged or did
not engage in this activity. Examples of tribal mechanisms for regulating
research included tribal institutional review boards (IRBs), tribal research
codes, tribal resolutions, formal contracts with tribal governments, research
agreements, data sharing agreements, and memoranda of
agreement/understanding.

Community collaboration throughout the research process
(Table 2) is the third column header.
An entry of “Y” was made if the article explicitly stated that the
research project involved a community member who functioned as a tribal
liaison/facilitator tasked with responsibilities including, but not limited to,
promoting community engagement in the research process and communication between
researchers and the community or if information provided in the
article strongly suggested that a community member filled this role. Entries of
“N” indicate whether the article explicitly stated that the
research project involved a community member who functioned as a tribal
liaison/facilitator tasked with responsibilities including, but not limited to,
promoting community engagement in the research process and communication between
researchers and the community or whether information provided
in the article strongly suggested that no community member filled this role. An
“NR” was entered if the article did not report whether the
researchers employed a community member to function as a tribal
liaison/facilitator and if no information provided in the
article strongly suggested that a community member filled or did not fill this
role.

The column, Project employment of a community member
(Table 2), has entries of
“Y” if the article explicitly stated that community members were
involved in the selection or development of study design, methods, or approach
or if information presented in the article strongly
suggested that community members were involved in these activities. An
“N” was entered if the article explicitly stated that community
members were not were involved in the selection or development of study design,
methods, or approach or if information presented in the article
strongly suggested that community members were not involved in these activities.
Entries of “NR” were used if the article did not report whether
community members were involved in the selection or development of study design,
methods, or approach and if the article did not present
information that strongly suggested that community members were or were not
involved in these activities.

3. Results
Of the 178 articles in the original scoping review on PR in AIAN
communities, 23 articles included a description of:

Community group involved in research project;

Community-level decision-making power over the research project;

Ongoing input from community members for project described;

Tribal-level regulation over research project;

Relationships established between community and researchers prior to
project initiation, and

Relationships between community and researchers maintained beyond
project conclusion.

Publication dates for the 23 articles ranged from 2000 to 2016. Study
characteristics of community protections in PR are in Table 2.

Use of a CBPR research framework was reported in 87% (20/23) of the
articles. Of the 20 articles that used CBPR, 4 articles reported utilizing a TPR or
TPR-like framework in addition to CBPR framework. The use of a general PR approach
was reported in 13% (3/23) of the articles. Of the 21 articles published in 2005 or
later, 20 reported using a CBPR framework.

Seventy-four percent (17/23) of articles described studies or projects
occurring in communities located in rural settings, and 26% (6/23) described
research occurring in a combination of rural and urban settings. No articles
described research in an urban setting only.

Twenty-six percent (6/23) of articles reported that the community involved
in the research project had a tribal research department, 9% (2/23) reported not
having a research department, and 65% (15/23) did not include descriptions of a
tribal research department. Thirty-nine percent (9/23) of articles reported the
development of community-level mechanisms for regulating research if not present, 4%
(1/23) reported that a community-level mechanism for regulating research was not
developed if it did not exist, and 57% (13/23) did not report on the development of
a community-level mechanism for regulating research if not present.

Ninety-one percent (21/23) reported that the community members collaborated
with researchers throughout the research process. In the other 9% (2/23) of
articles, this information was not reported. Fifty-seven percent (13/23) of the
articles reported project employment of a community member. Four percent (1/23)
reported not employing a community member, and 39% (9/23) of articles did not report
employing a community member.

One article did not include descriptions of any of the four community-level
protection measures and seventeen percent of articles (4/23) included descriptions
of all four community-level protection measures.

4. Discussion
Scoping reviews can be used to identify gaps in the existing literature
(Arksey and O’malley 2005). This
review highlights the variability on the reporting of health-related PR that
involves AIAN communities and underscores an absence of reporting on research
projects following principles related to PR. It is notable that of the 178 articles
included in the original scoping review on PR in AIAN communities, only 23 articles
or 13% met the community-protection description inclusion criteria for this
analysis. Within CBPR and other PR approaches, there appears to be a lack of
attention to reporting community-level protection processes and practices and this
review suggests a need for improved reporting guidelines.

Communicating engagement practices when reporting on study findings in
health research with AIAN communities is necessary to provide a framework for
researchers unfamiliar with oversight processes unique to AIAN communities, to
empower AIAN communities that participate in health research, and hold researchers
working with AIAN communities accountable to PR principles developed to protect
communities from research harms. Researchers unfamiliar with engaging with AIAN
communities may not realize how impactful the socio-political experiences with
research can be in shaping collaborations and participatory projects. Reporting
explicit practices can provide a model for others to consider when engaging AIAN
communities in research.

To account for the time and effort in developing research oversight
processes and practices deemed acceptable by AIAN communities and for researchers to
carry out mutually beneficial health research, it is vital that resultant processes
and practices are reported in the academic literature. Reporting these processes and
practices does not only promote the transparency necessary for conducting research
in AIAN communities (Fisher and Ball 2003;
Christopher et al. 2011; Claw et al. 2018), but honors the effort the community
put forth in the development and conduct of the research project.

Further, describing these efforts in academic literature allows for AIAN
community preferences to have impact beyond the research project. Many AIAN
teachings are upheld through oral stories that encompass important life lessons,
which are passed on throughout generations. To mirror this concept, researchers have
the ethical obligation to uphold their responsibility of passing on the important
lessons learned from working with an AIAN community for the benefit of other AIAN
communities and researchers.

Last, the lack of reporting of community protection efforts can impact
research practices with other Indigenous peoples and groups other than AIAN
communities. Due to the unique political designation of AIAN peoples in the US, AIAN
tribal groups have a designated structure within their communities that allow for
formal processes to be developed to govern research and the sovereignty to enforce
these processes. However, other groups may not have the structure in place to
develop such processes and may not have the legal jurisdiction to enforce research
oversight processes.

4.1. Research with Urban AIAN Communities
Ensuring research involving AIAN people located in urban settings
utilizes appropriate community-level protections can present distinct
challenges. Of the 23 articles included in this analysis, none involved an urban
group alone; and six included urban groups in addition to rural groups (Orians et al. 2004; Horn et al. 2008; Daley et al. 2010; Fleischhacker et
al. 2011; Fleischhacker et al.
2012; Griese et al. 2016).
Urban AIAN groups are often dispersed throughout an urban center, making it
diffcult to identify and partner with urban AIAN groups (Castor et al. 2006). Despite this difficulty,
inclusion of AIAN groups in urban areas is important because a large number of
AIAN people reside in an urban setting (Urban
Indian Health Commission 2007). AIAN people living in urban areas may
reside and gather in several locations. If studies are to recruit truly
representative samples from these groups, more time may be required to build
relationships across the many organizations that serve AIAN people living in
urban areas.

Moreover, AIAN people living in urban settings may represent several
tribes with different political structures and cultural norms. As a result, it
can be challenging to determine which entities have the sovereign right and
responsibility of providing appropriate research protections for these groups
and to deploy protections that account for the political and cultural
differences between groups. It is also unclear whether tribes have a
responsibility in protecting their individual tribal members who reside in urban
centers. Further, researchers may have a responsibility to seek approval from
tribal leadership of AIAN tribal members residing in urban settings.

4.2. Community-Level Research Review
Community-level research review has been used as a means to mitigate
tribal community-level concerns throughout the research process (Hiratsuka et al. 2017). While community-level
research review has appeared in PR, the time-intensive nature of this process is
sometimes described by researchers as a barrier and may inhibit its widespread
uptake (Wolf et al. 2005). Although
consensus-building activities and long-term partnerships take time, they have
important benefits for communities and are key elements in PR (Bromley et al. 2015). Further, investigators may not
be able to accurately assess the degree of risk and benefit for the community
for proposed research that is provided by a community-level research review
(Gbadegesin and Wendler 2006).
Reporting on abiding by this PR principle holds the researcher accountable and
shows respect for tribal oversight.

Nine of the articles in this analysis included descriptions of a system
or procedure for regulating research and a tribal IRB or tribal community-level
review was not available (Table 2).
Tribal IRBs or a tribal community-level review of research can provide an
expansion on the Common Rule that includes requirements for review and approval
of all publications and presentations resulting from the research (Chadwick et al. 2014; Angal et al. 2016) A tribal community-level review in
health research is an acknowledgement of an AIAN groups’ sovereign right
to oversee research to protect tribal citizens from individual and/or group
harm, (Hull and Wilson 2017) and provides
a way for AIAN communities to stay informed of research results and
dissemination activities (Angal et al.
2016). It should be noted that five of the six articles including an
urban sample did not provide a description of a system or procedure for
regulating research and a tribal IRB or tribal community-level research review
was either not available or not reported as being sought (Orians et al. 2004; Legaspi and Orr 2007; Fleischhacker
et al. 2011; Fleischhacker et al.
2012).

Tribal IRBs, other forms of research review committees, and written
policies to oversee research activities are approaches that some tribal
communities are adopting to exert sovereign authority over research (Chadwick et al. 2014). These AIAN-governed
bodies may be charged not only with protecting individual research participants
but also the tribal community as a whole, ensuring that potential benefits are
not negated by inappropriately conducted research (Morton et al. 2013). Written policies provide a
mechanism to address federal funding agency requirements such as broad data
sharing, data ownership, and newer requirements such as single IRB review for
multi-site research studies (Wolinetz and
Collins 2017) which may conflict with tribal protocols and process,
or even tribal protections completely (Hull and
Wilson 2017).

4.3. Community–Academic Partnerships in Research
Both CBPR (Israel 2013) and TPR
(Fisher and Ball 2003; Mariella et al. 2009) describe
community–academic partnerships as essential aspects of PR. Twenty-one of
the 23 articles in this analysis includes a description of community member
collaboration throughout the research process, reinforcing the notion that
effective partnerships promote successful community-driven projects. These
community–academic partnerships underscore the establishment of trust
after many AIAN communities have declined to participate in research studies due
to past harms (Garrison and Cho 2013;
James et al. 2014; Blacksher et al. 2016; Morales et al. 2016; Brockie et al. 2017).

Community–academic partnerships have important points to consider
that may be unfamiliar to some. For example, developing the relationships
crucial to the success of a community–academic partnership requires an
extended planning period and cost commitments (Chadwick et al. 2014; Bromley et al.
2015). The recruitment and training efforts necessary for developing
both community research capacity and researcher knowledge of community culture
are similarly time-intensive and incur additional cost (Thomas et al. 2011). Tribal review of research
proposals and products require planning around set meeting dates that may extend
timelines (LaVeaux and Christopher 2009).
Increased time commitments and costs are among the most commonly cited learning
curves necessary to build mutually beneficial community–academic
partnerships in research (Drahota et al.
2016).

Interestingly, several articles did not report on project employment of
a community member despite most articles reporting community collaboration. Most
past research failed to include AIAN communities as equal partners, and rarely
did an AIAN community have the capacity to take the lead on health research
projects (Blue Bird Jernigan et al. 2015).
Employing a community member as part of the research project can help to shift
this narrative. Additionally, a community member employed by the research
project may be able to navigate previously reported challenges encountered when
conducting research with community–academic partnerships such as the
absence of shared goals and expectations, a lack of clarity regarding individual
roles and responsibilities, and other consequences of poor communication (Drahota et al. 2016). Finally, the sharing
of knowledge between community members and researchers further establishes trust
by providing bidirectional learning and understanding of cultural differences
through the PR approach.

4.4. Limitations and Future Research
This review utilized a dataset from articles identified in a study on
the scope of literature on PR practices with AIAN people in the US and may not
represent all literature on PR with AIAN people. Moreover, articles identified
and included in the main dataset did not focus specifically on the ethical
aspects of PR. Future reviews on PR practices may benefit by including
non-indexed databases, more inclusive search terms, utilize an extended
publication time period, include Indigenous groups globally and expand the
search of practices beyond US based articles. It is important to note that the
same research project or group of related projects may be described by more than
one article in this review.

Articles included in this analysis were selected based on the presence
of inclusion criteria described previously, which may not reflect the actual
practice that took place but highlights what is and what is not reported in the
literature. Further, this study found variation in the reporting practices on
community protection efforts used in health research with AIAN communities which
may call to question the need for overall reporting guidelines. Further inquiry
on reporting practices in general may be warranted.

5. Conclusions
This review reveals the inadequate reporting of PR practices in the
literature on health research with AIAN communities. Several authors have proposed
that PR methods such as CBPR and TPR are appropriate mechanisms to protect AIAN
communities engaged in research (Pacheco et al.
2013; Simonds and Christopher
2013); however, the requirement to report on how PR approaches were enacted
is missing. It is vital to include explicit descriptions of community protection
practices in reporting on PR with AIAN communities to uphold the necessity for
mutually beneficial research and inclusion of the community voice throughout the
research project outlined by PR approaches. This perspective is particularly
applicable to AIAN communities, many of which are sovereign nations with an inherent
right to self-determination, including determination of how and what kind of
research will be conducted in their communities. Standards of research practice
reporting to include community protections in research involving Indigenous
populations is warranted to document and evaluate the adherence to best practices
and ethical frameworks aimed at meaningful and ethical engagement with Indigenous
people.
