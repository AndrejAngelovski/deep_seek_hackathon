Abstract

Objective

To systematically review the literature on the mental health of adolescents associated with sexual and reproductive outcomes, and compare the mental health outcomes with that of other age groups.

Methods

We searched seven databases for relevant peer-reviewed articles published between 1 January 2010 and 25 April 2019. Our inclusion criteria required that the study included age-disaggregated data on adolescents, and focused and assessed mental health outcomes associated with pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. We extracted data on the specific health event, the mental health outcome and the method of measuring this, and comparisons with other age groups.

Findings

After initially screening 10 818 articles by title and abstract, we included 96 articles in our review. We observed that a wide-ranging prevalence of mental ill-health has been reported for adolescents. However, most studies of mental health during pregnancy did not identify an increased risk of depression or other mental disorders among adolescents compared with other age groups. In contrast, the majority of studies conducted during the postpartum period identified an increased risk of depression in adolescents compared with other age groups. Three studies reported on mental health outcomes following abortion, with varying results. We found no studies of the effect of sexually transmitted infections on mental health among adolescents.

Conclusion

We recommend that sexual and reproductive health services should be accessible to adolescents to address their needs and help to prevent any adverse mental health outcomes.

Résumé

Objectif

Procéder à une revue systématique de la littérature consacrée aux liens entre la santé mentale des adolescents et leur santé sexuelle et reproductive, et comparer les observations relatives à la santé mentale avec celles des autres catégories d'âge.

Méthodes

Nous avons examiné sept bases de données à la recherche d'articles pertinents avec comité de lecture, publiés entre le 1er janvier 2010 et le 25 avril 2019. Pour répondre à nos critères d'inclusion, l'étude devait contenir des données ventilées par âge sur les adolescents, se concentrer sur la santé mentale en cas de grossesse ou d'infection sexuellement transmissible et l'évaluer. Nous avons prélevé des informations sur l'événement lui-même, sur la santé mentale et la méthode employée pour l'évaluer, mais aussi des comparaisons avec d'autres catégories d'âge.

Résultats

Après avoir passé au crible le titre et le résumé de 10 818 articles, nous avons retenu 96 études pour notre revue. Nous avons constaté une grande diversité de prévalence des troubles mentaux chez les adolescents concernés. La plupart des études s'intéressant à la santé mentale pendant la grossesse n'ont toutefois pas identifié plus de risques de dépression ou d'autres troubles mentaux dans cette tranche d'âge que dans d'autres. En revanche, la majorité des études menées au cours de la période post-partum ont fait état d'un risque accru de dépression chez les adolescents par rapport à d'autres catégories. Trois études mentionnent des problèmes de santé mentale après un avortement, avec divers résultats. Nous n'avons trouvé aucune étude consacrée aux répercussions des infections sexuellement transmissibles sur la santé mentale des adolescents.

Conclusion

Nous recommandons de rendre les services de santé sexuelle et reproductive accessibles aux adolescents afin de répondre à leurs besoins et de limiter l'impact négatif sur leur santé mentale.

Resumen

Objetivo

Revisar sistemáticamente las publicaciones sobre la salud mental de los adolescentes asociada a los resultados sexuales y reproductivos, y comparar los resultados de salud mental con los de otros grupos de edad.

Métodos

Se realizaron búsquedas en siete bases de datos de artículos relevantes revisados por expertos y publicados entre el 1 de enero de 2010 y el 25 de abril de 2019. Nuestros criterios de inclusión requerían que el estudio incluyera datos desglosados por edad de los adolescentes, centrados y que evaluaran los resultados de salud mental asociados con el embarazo o las infecciones de transmisión sexual. Se extrajeron datos sobre el evento de salud específico, el resultado de salud mental y el método de medición de este, así como las comparaciones con otros grupos de edad.

Resultados

Después de seleccionar inicialmente 10.818 artículos por título y resumen, se incluyeron 96 estudios en nuestra revisión. Observamos que se ha informado de una amplia prevalencia de mala salud mental en las adolescentes. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los estudios sobre salud mental durante el embarazo no identificaron un mayor riesgo de depresión u otros trastornos mentales entre las adolescentes en comparación con otros grupos de edad. En cambio, la mayoría de los estudios realizados durante el período posparto identificaron un mayor riesgo de depresión en las adolescentes en comparación con otros grupos de edad. Tres estudios informaron sobre los resultados de la salud mental después del aborto, con resultados variados. No se encontraron estudios sobre el efecto de las infecciones de transmisión sexual en la salud mental de las adolescentes.

Conclusión

Recomendamos que los servicios de salud sexual y reproductiva sean accesibles a los adolescentes para atender sus necesidades y ayudar a prevenir cualquier resultado adverso para la salud mental.

ملخص

الغرض إجراء مراجعة منهجية للمؤلفات المتعلقة بالصحة العقلية للمراهقين، تلك المرتبطة بالنتائج الجنسية والإنجابية، ومقارنة نتائج الصحة العقلية بمثيلاتها للفئات العمرية الأخرى.

الطريقة قمنا بالبحث في سبع قواعد بيانات للمقالات ذات الصلة، التي تمت مراجعتها بواسطة الأقران، وتم نشرها بين 1 يناير/كانون ثان 2010، و25 أبريل/نيسان 2019. تطلبت معايير الشمول بالبحث لدينا أن تتضمن الدراسة بيانات مصنفة حسب العمر عن المراهقين، وأن تكون قد ركزت على نتائج الصحة العقلية المرتبطة بالحمل أو العدوى المنقولة جنسيًا، مع تقييم هذه النتائج. قمنا باستخراج بيانات عن الحدث الصحي المحدد، ونتائج الصحة العقلية وطريقة قياس ذلك، فضلاً عن عقد المقارنات مع الفئات العمرية الأخرى.

النتائج بعد الفحص المبدئي لعدد 10818 مقالة مصنفة حسب العنوان والملخص، قمنا بتضمين 96 دراسة في مراجعتنا. لاحظنا أنه تم الإبلاغ عن انتشار واسع النطاق لاعتلال الصحة العقلية بين المراهقين. إلا أن معظم دراسات الصحة العقلية خلال فترة الحمل لم تحدد الخطر المتزايد للاكتئاب أو غيره من الاضطرابات العقلية بين المراهقين، مقارنة مع الفئات العمرية الأخرى. على النقيض من ذلك، أشارت غالبية الدراسات التي أجريت خلال فترة ما بعد الولادة إلى زيادة خطر الإصابة بالاكتئاب لدى المراهقين مقارنة مع الفئات العمرية الأخرى. أوضحت ثلاث دراسات نتائج الصحة العقلية بعد الإجهاض، مشيرة إلى نتائج متفاوتة. لم نجد دراسات حول تأثير الأمراض المنقولة جنسياً على الصحة العقلية بين المراهقين.

الاستنتاج نحن نوصي بضرورة توفير خدمات الصحة الجنسية والإنجابية للمراهقين، وذلك لتلبية احتياجاتهم، والمساعدة في الحيلولة دون وقوع أية نتائج عكسية للصحة العقلية.

摘要

目的

旨在系统综述与性和生殖结果有关的青少年心理健康相关文献，并将这个阶段和其他年龄段青少年的心理健康结果进行比较。

方法

我们搜索了 7 个数据库，以查找 2010 年 1 月 1 日至 2019 年 4 月 25 日期间发表的相关同行评议文章。我们的纳入标准是该研究需包含按年龄分类的青少年相关数据，并重点讨论和评估与怀孕或性传播感染有关的心理健康结果。我们提取了与特定健康事件、心理健康结果及其测量方法以及与其他年龄段的比较情况相关的数据。

结果

结论

我们建议为青少年提供性健康和生殖健康服务，以满足其需求并帮助其预防任何不良心理健康结果。

Резюме

Цель

Провести системный обзор литературы по зависимости психического здоровья подростков от событий, имеющих последствия для их сексуального и репродуктивного здоровья, и сравнить с результатами оценки психического здоровья представителей других возрастных групп.

Методы

Для поиска в целях подготовки настоящего обзора рецензированных статей, опубликованных в период между 1 января 2010 года и 25 апреля 2019 года, нами были использованы семь баз данных. Критерии включения предусматривали использование в рамках исследования данных по подросткам без разбивки по возрасту, которые бы в первую очередь касались оценки зависимости психического здоровья от беременности или инфекций, передаваемых половым путем. Нами были извлечены данные о специфических, связанных со здоровьем событиях и влиянии соответствующих событий на психическое здоровье, а также о методике оценки указанного и сравнения результатов с результатами, полученными в отношении иных возрастных групп.

Результаты

После первоначального скринингового обследования по названию и тезисам 10 818 статей в обзор было включено 96 исследований. Было выявлено, что среди подростков отмечается широкая распространенность психических расстройств. Однако большинство исследований психического здоровья во время беременности не выявили повышенного риска депрессии или иных психических расстройств среди подростков в сравнении с иными возрастными группами. Напротив, большинство исследований, касающихся послеродового периода, выявили повышенный риск депрессии у подростков в сравнении с другими возрастными группами. В трех исследованиях сообщалось о состоянии психического здоровья после аборта, при этом результаты были неоднозначны. Не было обнаружено исследований о влиянии инфекций, передаваемых половым путем, на психическое здоровье подростков.

Вывод

Рекомендуется обеспечить доступ подростков к услугам в области сексуального и репродуктивного здоровья для удовлетворения их потребностей и предотвращения любых неблагоприятных последствий для психического здоровья.
==== Body
Introduction

In many countries, adolescents (i.e. those aged 10–19 years) struggle to access necessary sexual and reproductive health information and services.1 Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death globally for girls aged 15–19 years.2 One in four sexually active adolescents has a sexually transmitted infection, and 3 million girls aged 15–19 years undergo unsafe abortions annually.3

Although the effect of a sexual and reproductive health event (e.g. pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection) on an adolescent’s physical health and well-being is acknowledged,1 the global mental health burden that may be related to the outcomes of sexual activity is not well understood. A 2009 review conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) identified close links between women’s sexual and reproductive health and their mental health.4 However, many of the participants of this review were married women of childbearing age (i.e. often not adolescents) in middle- and high-income countries. The link between the sexual and reproductive health and the mental health of men and young, single women remains largely unexplored.4

We therefore conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of key sexual and reproductive health events on mental health outcomes among adolescents. Specifically, we focused on events that can occur as a result of unprotected sexual activity, for example: pregnancy; the result of that pregnancy; and/or sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Our systematic review addressed two main areas: (i) the adverse mental health outcomes experienced by adolescents worldwide following key sexual and reproductive health events; and (ii) how this mental health burden among adolescents compares with that of people of other ages after experiencing the same event.

Methods

Search strategy

Our protocol was adapted from that of a prior systematic review of causes of maternal morbidity and mortality,5 and was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We identified related publications by searching the databases PubMed®, CINAHL, Embase®, APA PsycINFO®, POPLINE, ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) and Global Index Medicus, as well the reference lists of relevant articles. We developed our search strategy for each database in collaboration with a librarian, using terms related to “mental health”, “adolescents” and “sexual and reproductive health”; we provide an example search strategy in the data repository.6

Selection criteria

Our search included peer-reviewed literature published between 1 January 2010 and 25 April 2019. We selected this particular date range to capture the most recent literature, but also to build on the 2009 WHO review of the mental health aspects of women’s reproductive health.4

Our inclusion criteria required that the study: included age-disaggregated data on male and/or female adolescents; focused on mental health outcomes associated with either a pregnancy, the result of that pregnancy (either childbirth and the postpartum period, or an abortion) and/or horizontally transmitted sexually transmitted infections; assessed mental health outcomes that followed a sexual and reproductive health event; and was peer-reviewed. Because of the inconsistency in the literature on the exact definition of the postpartum period,7 we included any articles referencing the postpartum period as within one year following childbirth. In the case of a randomized controlled trial or intervention study, we also included data from the control group.

We excluded studies that: had sample sizes less than 50; did not disaggregate adolescent-only data; did not quantify mental health outcomes; did not clarify that the sexual and reproductive health event preceded the mental health outcome of interest; used a sample group that was not representative of a general, healthy population (e.g. we excluded studies that recruited only individuals: (i) with specific pre-existing conditions such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, or a mental health condition; or (ii) exhibiting specific behaviours, such as injecting drugs); or were published in languages other than English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish or Turkish.

Following the removal of duplicates, we initially screened the articles by title and abstract before screening the remaining articles in full. The two reviewers assessed and categorized articles as include, unsure or exclude, resolving discrepancies through discussion. A third reviewer, whose judgement was considered final, adjudicated unresolved disputes.

Data extraction

We extracted data on the general study characteristics, the specific sexual and reproductive health event and the mental health outcome of interest (e.g. relative risk among adolescents compared with other age groups). We also extracted comparison data for other age groups if it was presented in a way that assessed the statistical difference between age groups, for example, odds ratio (OR) or relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The two reviewers who conducted the initial title and abstract screen independently extracted relevant data using an extraction form. All extracted data were double-checked and confirmed by the other reviewer, and the third reviewer resolved disagreement in the same manner as for study inclusion. Given the diversity in the study designs, measurement tools and definitions adopted in the included articles, we did not perform a meta-analysis of the findings; instead, we summarized outcomes according to type of sexual and reproductive health event.

We used a modified Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist to assess the quality of studies reporting prevalence data.8 We assessed papers for quality according to eight criteria (data repository),6 and assigned each criterion a score of either 0 (not fulfilled), 1 (unclear whether fulfilled) or 2 (fulfilled); possible scores ranged from 0 to 16. We developed categories of quality, and considered scores of ≤ 12, of 13 or 14, and of 15 or 16 to represent studies of low, medium and high quality, respectively. We also included the stipulation that high-quality articles must score 2 points for the fifth criterion, that is, the study used objective, validated criteria to measure the mental health outcome. The same two reviewers conducted separate quality assessments for all articles, with the same third reviewer resolving differences through discussion.

Results

We initially screened 10 818 articles by title and abstract, after removing duplicates; 9559 articles were immediately excluded. Following full-text review, we excluded another 1112 articles. We therefore included 96 articles in our review, spanning 26 different countries (Fig. 1). Forty-eight studies were conducted in high-income countries, 36 in upper-middle-income countries, 10 in lower-middle-income countries and only two in low-income countries. The United States of America was the country most represented with 38 studies, followed by Brazil with 22. Most (55 studies) were of medium quality and around one third (33 studies) were of high quality; the remainder (8 studies) were classified as being of low quality.

Fig. 1 Flow chart of the selection of studies in the systematic review on mental health outcomes among adolescents following sexual and reproductive health events

HIV: human immunodeficiency virus.

Around one half of the articles reported on the prevalence or mean/median of mental health conditions or symptoms during pregnancy (48 studies) and/or the postpartum period (51 studies). Three articles reported on the impact of abortion. None of our included studies reported on horizontally transmitted infections. All studies included only women in their samples with the exception of two: one study included both males and females9 and another included males only.10 We observed that a variety of tools were used to assess for mental health conditions, including symptom assessment scales or diagnostic tools or codes. Box 1 provides a summary of the tools used and the observed frequency of use among our included studies.

Of the nine studies (four of which also reported on depression) reporting on some type of anxiety disorder or symptoms during pregnancy, six studies provided prevalence, and the prevalence of at least mild symptoms or an anxiety disorder (including post-traumatic stress disorder) ranged from 13.6%21 to 19.2%.48 Four studies reported on mean or median anxiety scores. Six studies (three of which also reported on depression and/or anxiety) reported on broad mental disorders or common mental disorders or stress during pregnancy, with prevalence ranging from 22.5%17 to 40.5%.53 One study reported an incidence rate of 4.9%.55 Four studies (one of which also reported on depression, anxiety and general mental disorders) reported on suicidal ideation or behaviour. The prevalence of any suicidal ideation (including thoughts of self-harm or wishes to be dead) ranged from 4.2%21,47 to 8.9%,56 while the prevalence of any suicidal behaviour ranged from < 0.1% (147/1 242 318)57 to 13.3%.21,47

Eleven studies provided data regarding depression among adolescents compared with other age groups during pregnancy (Table 2). Of these, only three studies identified an increased risk of depression among pregnant adolescents when compared with older age groups; eight studies reported no increased risk. Five studies reported comparison data regarding general mental disorders or psychological distress among adolescents compared with other age groups during pregnancy. Again, the majority of these studies (four studies) did not identify an increased risk of general mental health problems during pregnancy among adolescents compared with other age groups. One study reported on adjusted OR for suicidal ideation during pregnancy, and found adolescents to be at greatest risk compared with other age groups.56

Postpartum

In the 49 studies that reported on the prevalence or mean/median of mental health conditions during the postpartum period (Table 3; 47 studies; available at: http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/5/20-54144) or during both pregnancy and the postpartum period (Table 4; 2 studies), we noted that the postpartum period was defined as being as short as 72 hours to as long as 1 year after delivery. The majority of these studies (46/49) reported on depression, most (38/46) reporting prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms (i.e. having at least mild symptoms at some time during the postpartum period) from 2.5%88 to 57.0%.70 Two studies reported on incidence, which was found to be 25.0% (95% CI: 13.2–36.8%) in one study,74 and 8.3% at 6 weeks, 5.2% at 3 months and 6.2% at 6 months postpartum in the other.77 Seven studies reported mean or median symptom scores. One study (Table 4) reported on the prevalence of depression during both pregnancy and the postpartum period.97

Only three studies focusing on the postpartum period alone reported on anxiety (as well as depression; Table 3), one of which reported the prevalence of any anxiety disorder as 15.3%.61 The other two studies provided results in the form of mean or median scores.18,44 Two studies reported on psychiatric disorders or psychological distress during the postpartum period (one of which also reported on depression), reporting a prevalence of 22.6%61 and 10.0%,95 respectively. Finally, one study reported the prevalence of suicidal risk during this period as 13.8%.96

Of the 13 studies that determined the risk of depression during the postpartum period in adolescents compared with other age groups, nine studies identified an increased risk of depression for adolescents. A study reporting on postpartum anxiety (as well as depression) did not find adolescents to be at a higher risk than other age groups (Table 5).101 However, a study examining suicide risk during this period found adolescents to be at the greatest risk of suicide compared with other age groups.96

Discussion

Our systematic review of the literature reporting on the mental health outcomes among adolescents after key sexual and reproductive health events reveals a very high prevalence of mental ill-health. This finding is particularly true for depression, the most commonly assessed mental health outcome in our review. The prevalence of depression varies widely between cultures;105 however, the WHO World Health Survey of 60 countries found an average annual prevalence of 3.2% in participants without comorbid physical disease.106 Global estimates indicate that 10% of pregnant women and 13% of postpartum women (of all ages) experience a mental disorder.107 However, among studies reporting the prevalence of depression in this review, 92.9% (26/28) of studies of pregnant adolescents, and 73.0% (27/37) of studies of postpartum adolescents, reported a higher figure than these global estimates.

Our results indicate a high prevalence of depression during pregnancy across all age groups, highlighting the importance of recognizing the mental health needs of all women during pregnancy. By contrast, while not conclusive, comparison data for the postpartum period suggests that there may be a higher prevalence of depression among postpartum adolescents than among postpartum women of older age groups. This higher prevalence among adolescents may be the effect of the challenges facing adolescent mothers in caring for an infant, such as financial burden, social isolation from peers, limited support and the detrimental consequences of being excluded from further education. Our findings also corroborate what is known about the adverse effects of early marriage and the often-ensuing expectation to give birth.108

Regardless of the nature of the sexual and reproductive health event, it appears that suicidality may be a concern for adolescents. Although only two studies provided comparison data on suicidality between age groups, both showed the risk to be significantly higher among adolescents compared with older age groups.56,96 Such findings are consistent with other research suggesting that adolescent mothers may have an elevated risk of suicidal ideation.109 This result emphasizes the need for both further research and enhanced services.

Although the assessments of mental health conditions other than depression were relatively limited, we found a high burden of anxiety and common mental health disorders among adolescents following sexual and reproductive health events. We were surprised to discover only a few studies reported on anxiety,110 given that depression and anxiety are often comorbid and that the prevalence of anxiety is high among adolescents; a study based in the USA found that 31.9% of adolescents have an anxiety disorder.111 Our findings point to the need for research on the full spectrum of mental disorders to fully understand the mental ill-health burden experienced by adolescents following such health events, concurring with other calls for research on a broader range of mental health conditions among perinatal women of all ages.112,113

Our findings reveal another gap in the mental health literature; we found only three articles that reported on abortion and zero articles reporting on the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among adolescents. Our search did identify 46 articles reporting on HIV; however, we had to exclude these from our review because HIV was either vertically transmitted (i.e. not the result of an unprotected sexual event) or the reviewers were unable to distinguish between mental health outcomes for vertically and horizontally transmitted HIV. Furthermore, while our review included studies on both males and females, nearly all of the included studies (with the exception of two) focused on adolescent females. While this finding is understandable for the reproductive events of pregnancy and abortion, there is an obvious need for more research on the mental health of adolescent males as a result of relevant sexual and reproductive health events (e.g. sexually transmitted infection/HIV, new fatherhood).

We also found few studies describing mental health outcomes following an abortion, highlighting another important area for further research. A study67 found depression rates to be lower among female adolescents with unintended pregnancies who had an abortion, compared with those who delivered, recorded either one year after abortion or delivery. Although this is only one study, this result supports the notion that when afforded the right to choose, women who elect to have an abortion rarely regret it.114

While our systematic review has several strengths – such as considering literature published over an entire decade, the thoroughness of the search, and the double-checking of data extraction and quality scoring results – there are some limitations. We did not examine risk factors for mental health outcomes among adolescents: there may be certain demographic factors (e.g. age, income, ethnicity, education level) within the adolescent population that could increase (i) their vulnerability to mental health challenges; (ii) their potential to experience a sexual and reproductive health event; and/or (iii) the incidence and severity of any resulting mental health outcomes. While we were interested in mental health outcomes following a sexual and reproductive health event, we could not always be certain about the exact temporal relationship; it is possible that mental health issues may have increased vulnerability to the particular sexual and reproductive health event. We also excluded qualitative studies from this review; although qualitative data can provide a rich understanding of the impact of such health events on the mental health and well-being of adolescents, a mixed-methods systematic review was beyond our scope. Finally, our quality assessment tool did not undergo a formal psychometric evaluation; however, we based our quality assessment tool on an existing and widely used instrument, which was deemed to have content validity and was used by two authors independently. We felt that this instrument was adequate for our objective of providing an explicit indication of study quality, rather than a precise measurement.

We identified methodological issues in many of the included studies. Most studies used assessment tools that screen for the severity of symptoms, but cannot provide a mental health diagnosis. We observed that a broad range of assessment tools were used, as well as different cut-off points for the same tool between different studies. For example, one study31 used a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) cut-off of ≥ 16, whereas another study16 used one of ≥ 24. Almost half of the included studies used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); of these studies, many (21/40) used a cut-off of ≥ 13 although others used scores of 1015 or 9.27 The field of mental health would benefit from the streamlining of screening tools and cut-offs used, which would also encourage research that uses diagnostic tools to confirm mental health conditions rather than solely identifying symptom severity. The use of rigorous clinical diagnostic interviews to assess mental health disorders would provide a clearer clinical picture of the mental health burden among adolescents who have experienced a sexual and reproductive health event.

To address the mental health burden associated with pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections, future work should identify effective psychosocial interventions that can be made available to adolescents who experience such a health event. There is evidence that adolescents often do not use mental health services, so these efforts should consider how to successfully connect identified adolescents with the care they need.115,116 Additional research could also identify risk and protective factors in adolescents who have experienced such a health event by comparing those who developed mental health issues with those who did not; this strategy may help to determine whether targeted interventions can build resiliency among adolescents who experience such a health event. Similarly, research is also needed to explore the extent to which adolescents experience adverse mental health outcomes, comparing those who previously experienced a sexual and reproductive health event with those who did not. As a promising step, WHO published the Guidelines on mental health promotive and preventive interventions for adolescents in 2020, with recommendations targeting all adolescents and particularly vulnerable groups.117

In conclusion, considering the mental health burden that adolescents are experiencing, we now need to develop, implement and evaluate appropriate services to support the adolescent population. Similarly, sexual and reproductive health services and information should be accessible to adolescents to address their needs and help to prevent any unintended outcomes that could have consequences for their mental health. Health-care providers encountering adolescents following such a health event must be prepared to screen for, and address, any mental health concerns. Going forwards, we recommend that mental health care is considered an integral part of sexual and reproductive health service provision.
