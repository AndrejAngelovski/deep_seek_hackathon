This dataset was compiled to estimate the levels of thermal comfort and mental health in a sample group of university students confined due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By the time research was carried out, these students of a hot and humid region of Mexico, had already spent 200 days on distance learning using online platforms. A total of 324 records were documented with a final sample of 316 valid participants. The total records were collected directly from the students through a web platform (Microsoft forms). This data set can be used to generate correlations between mental health, thermal comfort, and individual characteristics in the study population that will allow to identify the influence of the built environment and local climate on the levels of stress and anxiety that university students experienced under confinement. It can also be used to issue recommendations to improve the quality of built spaces and for the construction of adaptive models of thermal comfort considering mental health as a study variable.

1 Data Description

The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, since it has spread worldwide, affecting a large number of people [1]. According to the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), one year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost half of the world's learners continued to be affected by the partial or total closure of schools [2]. Regarding health effects, studies such as that of Ozamiz et al [3]. mention high levels of stress and anxiety in the first phase of the COVID-19 outbreak; severe and extremely severe levels of stress and anxiety were reported in the population, with the 18-to-25 age group having the highest prevalence of extremely severe levels. Likewise, considering confinement as the obligation to remain in their homes, environmental conditions become a factor that should be considered as a mediator in the behavior and health of the individual.

This dataset contains data for the estimation of thermal comfort levels (thermal and humidity) and mental health (stress perceived and anxiety) in a group of university students in the South of Mexico, with ages between 18 and 43 years old and an average of 20. The data was collected through a web platform (Microsoft Forms) where anonymous users answered each question. Then, the information was processed obtaining 316 records (172 females and 144 males) and 2 independent sets: the first set refers to thermal comfort and the second set to mental health, respectively. The surveys were generated and analyzed based on the scales suggested by the original authors of the instruments. The raw data is in Mendeley dataset which can be accessed through the following link: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hp7knm4zp9/3

The data about the sociodemographic status, school, internet connection, and health aspects were aimed to characterize the study population. It contained: gender, age, marital status, number of cohabitants, perception of the relationship with cohabitants (Table 1); internet access, type of internet connection, quality of internet connection (Table 2), diagnosed physical and/or mental illnesses (Table 3); consumption of psychoactive substances (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, non-prescription drugs, coffee, energy drinks) (Table 4); aspects related to health lifestyles (hours of sleep, number of meals per day, number of hours dedicated to physical activity per week) (Table 5); aspects related to environmental conditions and thermal comfort (Table 6). All these indicators were considered in the context of COVID-19 confinement.Table 1 Demographic information.

Moreover, in the case of the main variables of thermal comfort, the Thermal sensation scale and Humidity sensation scale of the Adaptation of the Questionnaire of Indoor Thermal Environments [4] were applied; for mental health, Cohen's Scale of Stress Perceived PSS-14 [5]; and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) [6] were applied. These are described below in Table 7.Table 7 Description of the scales (measuring instruments).

Each item was rated on a five-point Likert-type scale (0 = never to 4 = very often). Total scores were calculated after reversing positive items' scores and then summing up all scores. Possible total scores range from 0 to 56. A higher score indicates greater stress.	It consists of 21 items that evaluate symptoms of anxiety on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = “not at all” to 3 = “severely.” The anxiety level was scored using ordinal categories: normal (0–7 points), mild (8–15), moderate (16–25) and severe (26–63).

2 Experimental Design, Materials and Methods

This study was descriptive and cross-sectional. The data was collected through a survey applied to students from a public university who were using online learning platforms during the pandemic (COVID-19). They were in a hot and humid region of Mexico.

2.1 Materials

A survey was used for data collection. It was comprised of:• A questionnaire expressly developed for this study inquiring about personal information such as sociodemographic, school status, Internet connection, and health characteristics. Developed for the purpose of this study.

• Adaptation of the Questionnaire of Indoor Thermal Environments: questions about the environment where they were located, their clothing, perception of the environment, and perception of thermal sensation and humidity [4].

• The Scale of Stress Perceived of Cohen [PSS-14], that measures the degree to which life situations are perceived as stressful. This consists of seven items worded negatively: 1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, and 14, and the remaining seven worded positively: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13. Each item was rated on a five-point Likert-type scale 0 = never to 4 = very often. Total scores were calculated after reversing positive items' scores and then summing up all scores. Possible total scores for PSS-14 range from 0 to 56. A higher score indicates greater stress [7].

• Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). It consists of 21 items that evaluate symptoms of anxiety on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = “not at all” to 3 = “severely.” The anxiety level was scored using ordinal categories: normal (0–7 points), mild (8–15), moderate (16–25) and severe (26–63) [8,9].
