RESUMO
Apesar dos recentes avanços na reabilitação cognitiva de pacientes com distúrbios
cognitivos, existem muitos e graves obstáculos ao uso otimizado globalmente
desse recurso terapêutico.

Objetivo:
Os autores destacam o conceito de ‘sinergismo terapêutico’, ou seja, o uso
simultâneo de terapias de reabilitação farmacológica e cognitiva,
maximizando os benefícios funcionais, a fim de abordar a otimização da
abordagem terapêutica dos distúrbios cognitivos.

Métodos:
Três paradigmas de inter-relacionamento psicofarmacológico e de reabilitação
são apresentados em três contextos clínicos diferentes.

Resultados:
Paradigma 1: sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que dificultam um programa
de reabilitação cognitiva, mas podem ser melhorados com a psicofarmacologia.
Paradigma 2: sintomas cognitivos que dificultam a reabilitação cognitiva,
mas podem ser melhorados com anticolinesterásicos. Paradigma 3: sintomas
comportamentais que dificultam o uso da reabilitação cognitiva melhorada por
drogas psicotrópicas.

Conclusão:
O uso criterioso das drogas psicotrópicas nos distúrbios cognitivos pode
beneficiar, direta ou indiretamente, as funções cognitivas, favorecendo,
portanto, outras modalidades de tratamento para o comprometimento cognitivo,
como a reabilitação neuropsicológica.

==== Body
Despite recent advances in cognitive rehabilitation of patients with cognitive disorders,
there are many major obstacles to the optimized global use of this therapeutic resource.
Some patients may find it difficult to adhere to cognitive rehabilitation due to the
lack of insight regarding cognitive deficits, or because of compromised brain systems,
or even general difficulty in performing daily tasks, sense of hopelessness, lack of
energy and apathy, symptoms that may be due to the disease itself or associated to
depression or other comorbid psychiatric disorders.1 For cognitive rehabilitation methods to be effective, patients must be
adequately engaged and motivated not only to begin a rehabilitation process, but also to
remain involved in the intervention until a therapeutic dosage can be achieved.1 Many patients do not benefit from rehabilitation
or cannot be indicated for this procedure because of partially treated behavioral
symptoms, either for lack of a diagnosis, or for inadequate or underdosing of
medications. On the other hand, misuse of drugs by patients, especially medications with
cognitive effects, can compromise the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation.2


Notwithstanding recent evidence suggesting that concurrent pharmacological and behavioral
methods may maximize functional benefits for patients suffering from, for example,
dementia,3
-
5 there is an inexplicable scarcity of studies
concerning the therapeutic synergism between psychopharmacology and cognitive
rehabilitation, reflecting the unfortunate absence of contact between these two domains:
pharmacological (biomedical approach) and non-pharmacological (essentially the
psychological approach). 

In this article, we present three paradigmatic cases on how these two domains can be
interconnected and through which strategies the psychopharmacological approach can
optimize the implementation of cognitive rehabilitation techniques to enhance
improvement in real-world functioning.

METHODS
Using a qualitative approach, the main principles or strategies of association
between psychoactive drugs and cognitive rehabilitation used in the Memory Clinic at
the Federal University of Goiás (UFG), in Central Brazil, were reviewed. We focused
attention on pharmacological management that addresses the optimization of cognitive
rehabilitation techniques.

The Institute of Memory at the UFG is a referral center for cognitive disorders in
Central Brazil with 20 years of experience in the evaluation, diagnosis and
multidisciplinary treatment of cognitive disorders. Centers such as this have
academic credentials to seek, through their accumulated experience, some subjective
principles that govern conduct and therapeutic strategies in areas where there is
little literature.

RESULTS
We identified three models of interaction between psychoactive drugs and cognitive
rehabilitation that seek to optimize rehabilitation methods. Each of these models
will be exemplified by a clinical case illustrating the way psychopharmacology and
cognitive rehabilitation interact.

CASE 1

Paradigm 1: Behavioral and cognitive symptoms that hinder a
cognitive rehabilitation program, but can be improved with
psychopharmacology

Cloney (fictitious name), 25 years old, is a patient with invasive developmental
disorder (autistic syndrome), presenting with severe behavioral and cognitive
changes. The behavior alterations that prevented a cognitive rehabilitation
approach included impulsivity and aggressiveness (he took the papers from the
teacher’s desk and ripped them up compulsively, despite being asked not to do so
several times; whenever a child passed him by, he would grab them by the arm and
attack them; he presented several episodes of direct violence towards people who
assisted him; disobeyed commands and did not respect the social limits and rules
previously imposed), dysphoria, compulsive overeating, motor restlessness and
hyperactivity. Cognitive disorders included severe mental retardation, with
impairments in several cognitive domains. The cognitive disorders that most
affected his functional adaptation and social life were cognitive inflexibility,
insight absence, Theory of Mind deficit, impaired decision-making, expressive
language difficulties, and severe attention deficit. Cloney also presented
extreme intolerance to any modification of his environment, reacting
aggressively when this occurred (he broke everything around him).

Due to prejudice held by both his mother and the multi-professional care team,
Cloney was not taking any medication for his disorder. After explaining to them
how modern psychopharmacy could help him control some of his worse behavioral
issues, and maybe even improve some of his basic cognitive functions, thereby
allowing a rehabilitation approach, a pharmacological regimen was started
consisting of aripiprazole 15mg/day (prescribed to improve social behavior,
reduce aggressiveness and control restlessness), fluoxetine 20 mg/day (indicated
to control compulsive overeating and dysphoria) and methylphenidate 40mg/day
(prescribed to improve attention span, and reduce both hyperactivity level and
appetite).

One month after starting on this medication, Cloney showed a marked improvement
in many aspects of his behavior, which also presented as benefits in a variety
of cognitive functions: 1) motor restlessness ceased and, consequently, he could
sit still in a chair, focusing his attention better, allowing a better verbal
approach and eye-to-eye interaction; 2) impulsivity also ceased, and his actions
became more predictable, improving the safety of the care team since they could
prevent certain responses or undesired actions; 3) improved many aspects of his
relationships, as he obeyed social rules (started to accept his mother and
teachers’ authority) and became more sociable in general, so he could engage in
group interactions, including with other children; 4) he became more tolerant to
the limits established and to the external rules imposed, eliminating the
explosive reactions when his immediate desires were denied; 5) it became easier
to negotiate with him on decisions that involved immediate desires - after
medication he started to accept that his desires may be satisfied in exchange
for some effort (for example, helping his mother or following teachers’
requests). These improvements promoted a better-structured cognitive-behavior
base, more amenable to the application of adequate rehabilitation techniques.
Before the psychopharmacological intervention, even simple cognitive-behavior
approaches were impossible. Currently, Cloney is reasonably engaged in cognitive
rehabilitation, and his team of health professionals and teachers, as well as
the other students and patients, no longer fear him.

CASE 2

Paradigm 2: Cognitive symptoms that hinder cognitive
rehabilitation, but can be improved with anti cholinesterases

Homero (fictitious name), 74 years old, is a patient with Alzheimer’s disease,
naïve to treatment with anticholinesterases (most effective medication group for
this dementia).4 As the treatment with
galantamine did not work because of side effects (severe nausea, tachycardia and
dizziness), the family were reluctant to try this pharmacological group again. A
glutamatergic antagonist (memantine) was prescribed, without any significant
benefit in cognition, particularly in memory.

Homero presented a severe memory deficit and inability to learn new information,
which made neuropsychological rehabilitation approaches even harder. Despite the
three sessions he had every week, there was no effective improvement of the
patient, comparing to previous sessions, so it was not possible to advance to
the next phases of the process. The family noted no benefits in the
social-functional sphere. Since there was no benefit of the neuropsychological
rehabilitation, the therapeutic approach was discontinued.

Donepezil (another anticholinesterase, although with more favorable side-effect
profile) was then prescribed at the dosage of 10mg/day in order to improve
cognitive outcome, especially recent memory and, consequently, enhance his
learning mechanisms. Three months after starting use of the medication, Homero
presented a clear memory improvement, and his attention capacity was better,
favoring the learning process. In fact, the improvement was very evident when he
resumed rehabilitation: his attention span had developed, he could maintain
recently learned information available for longer in working memory (for
example, during the execution of a task, he could gather information that was
necessary later for use in a new task). 

CASE 3

Paradigm 3: Behavioral symptoms that hamper the use of cognitive
rehabilitation, but can be improved by psychotropic drugs 

Thelma (fictitious name), 67 years old, suffering from depression (not previously
diagnosed) associated with dementia in Parkinson’s disease. Despite being in use
of an anticholinesterasic drug and memory deficit improvements achieved, her
greatest difficulty was adhering to the cognitive rehabilitation. Thelma
presented intense fatigability, being incapable of remaining in continuous
consultation for more than five seconds. Her low attentional span impaired all
the rehabilitation approaches that relied on attention for task execution. She
also exhibited economy of effort with many answers like “I don’t know”. She had
a pessimistic attitude to cognitive rehabilitation, believing that she couldn’t
obtain any benefit from it, and was unable to develop any involvement or
affective bonding with the rehabilitation professional, proving averse to the
activity. In many situations, she was anxious and irritated with the activity,
creating ploys to leave and stop the process.

Thelma was referred to a psychiatrist who diagnosed masked depression. She was
started on a noradrenergic antidepressant (mirtazapine 30 mg /day). A month
later, clear improvement in the patient’s mood was observed: she was more active
and had more physical/mental energy, was more interested in the ongoing tasks,
regained the pleasure associated with social contact and other activities, could
maintain her attentional focus for much longer, could see the point in
investing, more actively, in the rehabilitation. Indeed, after the depression
treatment, her involvement and performance in the cognitive rehabilitation
activities increased markedly.

DISCUSSION
From the reported cases, we can infer three models of interaction between
psychopharmacology and cognitive rehabilitation:

In the patient receiving psychotropic drugs for an underlying disease state
where cognitive rehabilitation is indicated in order to improve the residual
cognitive deficits associated with the disease (for instance, in
schizophrenia, in which the medication is necessary to control the disease,
but does not always act on the common cognitive symptoms of this medical
condition);6
,
7


In patients with executive dysfunction (one of the areas in which cognitive
rehabilitation is known for having more limited results), the use of some
drugs can optimize treatment (for example, the use of memantine in patients
with cognitive inflexibility, such as in the case of pathological
gamblers);8


Many patients may not be suitable for cognitive rehabilitation due to
psychiatric symptoms that hinder the full conducting of the process (e.g.
aggressive, agitated patients that are incapable of therapeutic bonding, or
apathetic and asthenic patients that do not engage sufficiently in the
therapeutic process).1
,
9 In others, despite attempts to
rehabilitate, they have only discrete or diminished improvement because of
psychiatric symptoms. In both cases, medication may be used as an agent for
reducing dysfunctional behavior, allowing the application of the
rehabilitation in a safe and effective manner, or improving results when the
rehabilitation is already underway, but in a limited way.

Our study highlights the concept of ‘therapeutic synergism’, i.e. the concurrent use
of pharmacological and cognitive rehabilitation therapies maximizing functional
benefits in order to address the optimization of the therapeutic approach for
cognitive disorders. 

Many other authors have been working on this approach in different scenarios and
within different rationales.5

13 The three paradigms presented describe
different scenarios in which a precise drug intervention (precision that must be
almost ‘surgical’) helps in the process of cognitive rehabilitation in many ways. 

In the first paradigm, the psychopharmacological intervention must provide the basic
conditions to ensure the patient can be indicated for cognitive rehabilitation,
otherwise they would not be an eligible candidate.

In the second paradigm, the pharmacological intervention in cognition enables and
facilitates the rehabilitation, which may then have a real chance of success. In
other words, the prescription of a cognitive enhancer to augment cognitive
rehabilitation outcomes, based on a rationale in which a cognitive enhancer proceeds
by targeting more basic discrete cognitive skills, so that cognitive rehabilitation
can progress to more complex skills. This assumes that the basic skills must be
refined before more complex skills can work effectively. Some authors also claim
that, currently, cognitive training exercises are used to improve basic cognitive
skills, but pharmacotherapy holds promise as a more effective treatment.5


In the third paradigm, the pharmacological intervention in behavior optimizes the
response to the ongoing rehabilitation process, since it overcomes an obstacle to
fully exploit the therapeutic process. For cognitive rehabilitation therapies to be
successful, patients must be adequately involved and motivated not only to begin
cognitive intervention but also to keep engaged in the rehabilitation program until
a therapeutic dosage can be reached.1


In a literature review about cognitive rehabilitation, Manzine & Pavarine14 found that, in most of the studies reviewed,
cognitive rehabilitation can provide more benefit for the patient’s rehabilitation
when combined with other interventions, such as pharmacological treatment. Provided
that both treatment modalities are aligned and optimized, the synergistic
therapeutic effects become evident. To this end, it is fundamental that the
attending physician is aware of the whole therapeutic program in which the patient
is engaged, having consistent notions of how one treatment modality may impact
(positively or negatively) the other, and of how delicate the relationship dynamic
is between them. Without such tools, there is a risk of wrongly assessing the
risk-benefit ratio involved in each pharmacological choice. In practice, unaware
physicians run the risk of prescribing a medication option that may, in some cases,
have negative effects on the patient’s cognitive function and also on their
cognitive rehabilitation.

In conclusion, judicious use of psychotropic drugs can benefit, directly or
indirectly, cognitive functions, thereby favoring other treatment modalities for
cognitive impairment, such as neuropsychological rehabilitation. This finding
reflects those of other authors.10
-
12 Fortunately, with better knowledge of the
available drugs in general (and psychotropics in particular), greater investment in
medical training, as well as a better technical and affective rapport between
medical and non-medical professionals, a more optimistic scenario will be possible
in the coming years.
