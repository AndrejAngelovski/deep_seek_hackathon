Sigma 1 receptor (σ1), a small transmembrane protein expressed in most human cells participates in modulating the function of other
membrane proteins such as G protein coupled receptors and ion channels. Several ligands targeting this receptor are currently in clinical
trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, ischemic stroke and neuro-pathic pain. Hence, this receptor has emerged as an attractive
target for the treatment of neuro-pathological diseases with unmet medical needs. It is of interest to identify and characterise novelσ1
receptor ligands with different chemical scaffolds using computer-aided drug designing approach. In this work, a GPCR-focused chemical
library consisting of 8543 compounds was screened by pharmacophore and docking-based virtual screening methods using LigandScout
4.3 and Autodock Vina 1.1.2 in PyRx 0.8, respectively. The pharmacophore model was constructed based on the interactions of a selective
agonist and another antagonist ligand with high binding affinity to the human σ1receptors. Candidate compounds were filtered
sequentially by pharmacophore-fit scores, docking energy scores, drug-likeness filters and ADMET properties. The binding mode and
pharmacophore mapping of candidate compounds were analysed by Autodock Vina 1.1.2 and LigandScout 4.3 programs, respectively. A
pharmacophore model composed of three hydrophobic and positive ionizable features with recognized geometry was built and used as a
3D query for screening a GPCR-focused chemical library by LigandScout 4.3 program. Among the screened 8543 compounds, 159
candidate compounds were obtained from pharmacophore-based screening. 45 compounds among them bound to σ 1receptor with high
binding-affinity scores in comparison to the co-crystallized ligand. Amongst these, top five candidate compounds with excellent druglikeness
and ADMET properties were selected. These five candidate compounds may act as potential σ1 receptor ligands.

Background
The discovery of sigma receptors was initiated in 1976 by Martin, et
al. Experimentation with synthetic opioids eluted to the existence of
new and unknown receptor(s) causing unpredictable psycho
activity [1]. Early characterization of the different receptor subtypes
(1 and 2) was based on ligand selectivity and protein mass [2-5].
The sigma-1 (σ1) receptor was sequenced, cloned, and had shown
unique pharmacological attributes in multiple studies [6-13]. Recent
studies revealed the crystal structure and topology of the σ1
receptor, which was shown to have transmembrane domains with a
single-pass structure [14]. The sub cellular localization of the σ1
receptor shows residence in lipid raft-like domains in endoplasmic
reticulum where it is thought to act as a chaperone protein [15,16].
Physiologically, σ1 receptors are heavily involved with ion
channels where they are found to interact with inositol
trisphosphate receptors (Ca+2 channels), multiple voltage-gated K+
channels, as well as volume-regulated Cl- channels [17-22]. The
involvement of σ1 receptors with multiple secondary messengers is
further reflected in its ability to influence the signalling of several
neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate as
well as neuronal growth factors [23-25].Furthermore, σ1 receptors
were found to be involved in several inflammatory pathways [26-28]. And the internalization of σ1 receptors into intracellular
compartments was shown to be in an active manner [29]. This wide
range of activity made σ1 receptors involved and targeted in many
disorders such as cancer and retinal neural degeneration, in
addition to a host of abnormal CNS conditions such as Alzheimer's,
schizophrenia, depression, and addiction [30-39]. There is currently
no known endogenous ligand exclusive to the σ1 receptor, but
multiple molecules have shown interaction with the σ1 receptor
with varying affinities and functionalities (i.e. agonistic or
antagonistic activity). Examples of these endogenous ligands are
dimethyl tryptamine, sphignosines, dehydro epiandrosterone,
pregnenolone, and progesterone [40-43]. Many compounds with
high affinity for σ1 receptors such as haloperidol (antagonist),
fluvoxamine, (+)-pentazocine, and dextromethorphan have been
used as valuable research tools, as well as antipsychotics,
antidepressants, neuroprotectants, and anti tussives [44-48].
Currently, σ1 receptor agonists and antagonists are in clinical
trials for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, ischemic stroke, and
neuropathic pain [49-51]. Thus, identification of new compounds
targeting theσ1 receptor may yield selective ligands that will
further enable us to understand and treat conditions where σ1
receptors underlie the disease.

In modern drug discovery, virtual screening of chemical databases
is a significant tool to identify new lead compounds to modulate
the activity of a particular target in time and cost-effective manners.
This computer-aided drug designing approach is broadly classified
into ligand-based and structure-based drug designing which
depends on the information available about the ligands and protein
structure (3D), respectively [52]. Recently, the structures of σ1
receptor in complex with different ligands have been reported,
which facilitated the application of structure-based approach for
identifying ideal pharmacophore against σ1 receptor[14].Therefore,
in this study, we approached the search for potential novel and
chemically diverse σ1 receptor ligands by pharmacophore and
docking-based sequential virtual screening of a GPCR-focused
chemical library against σ1 receptor using ligandScout 4.3 and
AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 programs [53,54].

Materials and Methods:
The methodology used in this research is shown in Figure 1.

Generation of pharmacophore model:
Pharmacophore describes the spatial arrangement of essential
interactions in a receptor-binding site. Structure-based
pharmacophore method deals with the three-dimensional structure
of macromolecules-ligand complex. The key chemical features of
the ligand binding pocket along with their spatial relationship are
considered to generate a pharmacophore model [55]. In this
context, LigandScout4.3 program was used to construct a
pharmacophore model based on two X-ray crystal structures of
human σ1 receptors in complex with two different ligands. The
PDB entries for these structures are 5HK1 and 5HK2 with an X-ray
resolution of 2.5051 and 3.2 Å, respectively. X-ray structures were
obtained from protein data bank [56].5HK1 and 5KH2 are 3D
structures of σ1receptor in complex with PD144418 and 4-IBP
ligands, respectively [14]. Initially, two separate pharmacophores
were generated from the interaction of these ligands with σ1
receptor using pharmacophore generation tool in LigandScout4.3
and then both pharmacophore hypotheses were aligned to extract
the shared features. Finally, the exclusion volume was added to the
final pharmacophore model to be used as 3D query features for
virtual screening of chemical database.

Selection of chemical library:
In silico virtual screening was performed with "Life Chemicals
GPCR Targeted Library" having 8543 ligand molecules to identify
lead molecules with high binding affinity toward σ1 receptor. The
chemical library was retrieved from Life Chemicals [57].

Pharmacophore-based virtual screening:
LigandScout4.3 program was used to carry out the structure-based
pharmacophore virtual screening of 8543 ligand molecules against
the corresponding pharmacophore model using a default setting.
LigandScout4.3 was used initially to convert the ligands SDF files
into PDB. The obtained hits from screening exercises were ranked
based on their pharmacophore fit scores.

Docking-based virtual screening:
Autodock vina 1.1.2 in PyRx 0.8 was used to perform the dockingbased
virtual screening of 159 candidate compounds against the Xray
structure of human σ1 receptor (PDB: 5HK1) [58].Initially,
PyRx was used for energy minimization of compounds and for
converting all molecules to AutoDock Ligand format (PDBQT).
Compounds with binding energy score better than the original
ligand (PD144418), 45 compounds, were considered for further
investigation.

Drug-likeness and ADMET properties:
The obtained candidate compounds from sequential virtual
screening were subjected to ADMET (absorption, distribution,
metabolism, elimination and toxicity) analysis. Swiss ADME web
server was used to calculate the drug-likeness parameters
according to Lipinski's rule of five as well as the ADME properties
[59]. The ProTox-II-Prediction of Toxicity of Chemicals web server
was used to predict the hepatotoxicity and mutagenicity of
compounds [60]. Compounds only with zero violation of drug-like
filters and having good blood brain barrier penetration and
aqueous solubility as well as unlikely to cause mutagenicity and
dose-dependent hepatotoxicity were picked out as final candidate
compounds.

Molecular docking method:
In order to understand how these ligands bind to σ1 receptor, the
five candidate compounds were considered for docking studies.
Autodock Vina 1.1.2 was used to perform molecular docking of
potential hits against X-ray structure of human σ1 receptor (PDB:
5HK1). Initially, the protein structure was prepared for docking by
removing unwanted water molecules and bound ligands from
protein structure and adding the polar hydrogen atoms using
Discovery Studio Visualizer 2019 [61]. In addition, the same
program was used to prepare the co-crystalized ligand and to
convert the files into PDB formats. The three-dimensional Grid box
for molecular docking simulation was obtained using Autodock
tools 1.5.6 [62]. The Grid box was centred to cover the active
binding site and all essential residues. Autodock tools program was
also used to convert protein and ligand files into PDBQT formats.
To validate the parameters of the docking approach, the
crystallized ligand, PD144418, was re-docked into the binding
pocket and the resulted pose was overlaid over the crystallized one
to predict the binding mode.

Results and Discussion
The final structure-based pharmacophore was generated from the
shared features of two pharmacophore models constructed from Xray
structures of two ligands, antagonist and agonist, bound to the
active site of human σ1 receptors. This pharmacophore modelling
approach was utilized as it was difficult to distinguish between
antagonist and agonist ligands of σ1 receptors based on the binding
data without obtaining the functional data. Both types of ligands
bind to the same binding site, adapt similar binding mode and
interact with almost the same residues in Figure 2 [63]. Therefore,
generating the model based on the complex of σ1receptor with
ligands having paradoxical actions could increase the efficiency of
pharmacophore design.

The first pharmacophore was based on the interaction of PD144418,
a high affinity and selective σ1 antagonist, bound to the active site
of σ1 receptor (PDB: 5HK1) with a Ki value of 0.08 nM [14]. This
pharmacophore comprised of four hydrophobic regions and a
positive ionizable group besides twelve exclusion volume spheres
that depicted the restricted regions defining the overall shape of the
binding pocket (Figure 3A). The hydrophobic features (HYD1,
HYD2 and HYD3) are located in a hydrophobic pocket composed
by Tyr103, Met93, Leu182, Ala98 Tyr206, Leu95, Ile178, Leu105 and
Ala185 which is occupied by the toluene group and the isoxazol
ring (Figure 3B). The fourth hydrophobic feature (HY4) is located
in a hydrophobic pocket constituted by Tyr120, Ile124 occupied by
the methyl group within the propyl side chain. The positive
ionizable tertiary amine group (PI) is located in close proximity to
Glu172 and Asp126. In the same manner, the second
pharmacophore was generated from the structure of 4-IBP, a high
affinity and selective σ1 agonist, bound to the same active site of σ1
receptor (PDB:5HK2) with a Ki value of 1.7 nM [14]. The latter
pharmacophore was made up of three hydrophobic regions, a
positive ionizable group and sixteen exclusion volume spheres
(Figure 3C). The hydrophobic features (HYD1', HYD2') are located
in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Tye103, Thr181, Thr202,
Leu182, Leu95, Tyr206, Ile178, Ala98, Leu105, Ala185 and
Met93which is occupied by the iodobenzene group. The third
hydrophobic feature (HYD3') is located in another hydrophobic
pocket composed by Phe133, Val162 and Ile124 that adapted the
benzene ring. Similarly, the positive ionizable tertiary amine group
(PI') is located in close proximity to negatively charged residues;
Glu172 and Asp126 (Figure 3D).

The alignment of these two pharmacophores to extract the shared
features resulted in the final pharmacophore containing four key
features three hydrophobic regions, a positive ionizable group
beside eight exclusion volume spheres as shown in Figure 4A. All
the pharmacophore features are around targetable active site of σ1
receptor with well-defined geometrical distances that are essential
for the binding to the receptor. Interestingly, this pharmacophore
model with a nitrogen atom centring two hydrophobic sides is in
agreement with the typical pharmacophore features for σ1 receptor
binders [64]. Therefore, compounds mapping on these features
might have potential to bind to σ1 receptors with high affinity as
well as to modulate their function.

In order to verify the derived structure-based pharmacophore
model, virtual screens were performed on two datasets of small
molecules of actives and decoys. The main reason for using this
method was to validate the ability of the pharmacophore to predict
the active molecules from inactive molecules [65]. The active set
was composed of 37 compounds collected from the literature and
the decoys were 1905 compounds with unknown activity toward σ1
receptor. After screening, the receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) graphs were generated, and the area under the curve (AUC)
as well as the enrichment factor (EF) was calculated. The early
enrichment factor (EF1%) was 27.6 with an ideal ROC-AUC value of
1 indicating that our pharmacophore model was rational for virtual
screening as it was able to predict 36 active compounds from the
total of 37 active compounds (Figure 4B).

In our study, a GPCR-focused chemical library of 8124 molecules
was screened against the derived pharmacophore model. Among
those, 159 compounds were found to fit the pharmacophore
features. The candidate molecules were ranked according to the
pharmacophore-fit score which reflected how the molecules fit the
features of the pharmacophore queries used for the virtual
screening. The pharmacophore-fit scores for these compounds
ranged from43.41 to 40.77.Subsequently, the identified candidate
compounds were subjected unbiasedly to docking-based virtual
screening to filter them further based on the binding energy score.
To filter the obtained 159 compounds, these molecules were
subjected to docking based high-throughput screening against the
active site of human σ1 receptor structure using Autodock Vina in
PyRx programs. The screening resulted in the identification of 45
candidate compounds with low binding affinity scores (ranged
from -12.4 to -10.1 Kcal/mole) in comparison to the co-crystal
ligand (-10.0 Kcal/mole) that was added to dataset.

Analyses of the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism,
elimination and toxicity) properties are a crucial step in drug
design. Lipinski's rule of five in Swiss ADME web server was
applied to filter the 45 compounds and select the potential hits [59].
The Swiss ADME web server restrictions were as follows;
molecular weight ≤ 500, MlogP≤4.5, topological polar surface area
(TPSA) ≤ 5, number of rotatable bonds ≤ 5, hydrogen bond
acceptors should be less than 10, hydrogen bond donors should be
less than 5. Since the site of action of σ1 receptor ligands is mostly
in the brain, the candidate compounds must be able to penetrate
the blood brain barrier (BBB). The level of aqueous solubility was
also considered as it is necessary to facilitate the in vitro and in vivo
characterization of potential hits. In addition, the hepatotoxicity
and mutagenicity profiles were also analyzed simultaneously for
the 45 compounds using ProTox-II web server [60]. Compounds
only with the following properties were considered as candidate
compounds. The compound must show zero violation of Lipinski's
rule of five; good aqueous solubility, an ability to penetrate the
BBB, be devoid of mutagenicity, and unlikely to cause dosedependent
hepatotoxicity. After applying these filters, only five
compounds with diverse chemical scaffolds were picket out. The
chemical structure, pharmacophore-fit score and binding free
energy score of these compounds are listed inTable 1.

In order to further refine the retrieved hits, candidate compounds
were docked into to the active site of human σ1 receptor using
Autodock Vina 1.1.2 program. The active binding site was defined
based on the bound ligand, PD144418 in an X-ray structure of the
σ1 receptor (PDB: 5HK1).Before performing the molecular docking,
we first validated our docking approach by extracting the co-crystal
ligands, PD144418, from the σ1 receptor structure and then redocked
it into the active binding site to verify the ability of the
docking program and protocol to reproduce the bioactive
conformation of PD144418. The resulted docking pose from this
exercise with the lowest binding free energy score adapted the
same binding mode as the co-crystal ligand Figure 5A. These
results illustrate the robustness of the docking program and
protocol.

The docking scores of the five candidate compounds (-11.5-10.2
Kcal/mole) were lower than that of co-crystal ligand (-10.00
Kcal/mole) as shown in Table 1. The best binding poses for the
candidate compounds are shown in Figure 5B-F. These compounds
adapted the same binding modes as the reported co-crystal ligands
within the active site of σ1 receptor. The candidate compounds
form extensive hydrophobic interactions with hydrophobic
residues within the active site. Importantly, the aromatic rings of
every candidate compound forms a π-π stacking interaction with
Tyr103 amino acid residue. This interaction is shown to be essential
for the binding to σ1 receptor [14] Moreover, the charge-charge
interaction between Tyr103 and Glu172 is also observed in our
docking results with all compounds which is suggested to be
necessary to stabilize the orientation ofTyr103in binding site as well
as the ligands binding [14]. The pharmacophore mapping of five
candidate compounds on the derived pharmacophore model is
depicted in Figure 6. The superimposing of these candidate
compounds on the pharmacophore model indicates that the
candidate compounds can produce perfect mapping with
pharmacophore model. The compounds have mapped all
pharmacophore features including the exclusion volume and
scored good fit values.

Conclusion
In this present work, we attempted to identify new σ1 receptor
ligands via a combined pharmacophore and docking-based virtual
screening with drug-likeness and ADMET analysis. The structurebased
pharmacophore model was established using two co-crystal
complexes of σ1 receptor bound to agonist and antagonist ligands.
The model was composed of three hydrophobic features and a
positive ionizable area and was used as a 3D query to screen a
focused GPCRs chemical library. Prior to screening of chemical
library, the model was validated using active and decoy sets
method to evaluate its eminence to identify reliable compounds.
Five candidate compounds possessing different chemical scaffolds
with excellent in silico binding scores, drug-likeness, hepatotoxicity
and mutagenicity profiles were identified. In summary, our study
suggested that these five candidate compounds may act as
potential σ1 receptor ligands with high binding affinity.
