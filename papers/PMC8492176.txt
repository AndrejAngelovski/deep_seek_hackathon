Synaptopathies are brain disorders characterized by dysfunctional synapses, which are specialized junctions between neurons that are essential for the transmission of information. Synaptic dysfunction can occur due to mutations that alter the structure and function of synaptic components or abnormal expression levels of a synaptic protein. One class of synaptic proteins that are essential to their biology are cell adhesion proteins that connect the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Neurexins are one type of synaptic cell adhesion molecule that have, recently, gained more pathological interest. Variants in both neurexins and their common binding partners, neuroligins, have been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we summarize some of the key physiological functions of the neurexin protein family and the protein networks they are involved in. Furthermore, examination of published literature has implicated neurexins in both neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. There is a clear link between neurexins and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. However, multiple expression studies have also shown changes in neurexin expression in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, this review highlights the potential importance of neurexins in brain disorders and the importance of doing more targeted studies on these genes and proteins.

pmc1. Introduction

There is accumulating evidence to suggest that synaptic dysfunction is present in both neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD), and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) [1]. In fact, involvement of the synapse is such a prominent feature of the pathogenesis of various brain disorders that it has led to the coining of a specific term, ‘synaptopathies’. Indeed, in the case of PD, the involvement of synaptopathy as an initial and central event in the disease pathogenesis, which precedes neuronal damage, has been postulated [2]. Synaptic dysfunction can occur due to mutations that alter the structure and function of synaptic components or abnormal expression levels of a synaptic protein.

Synapses are specialized junctions between neurons that transmit information and they connect neurons into millions of ‘neural circuits’ that underlie all brain functions [3]. The information transmitted allows the nervous system to respond to external stimuli and controls bodily functions, behaviour, emotions and memories [4]. This system is tightly controlled and regulated, and even slight perturbations can lead to synaptic dysfunction. An important aspect of synapse biology is the cell adhesion molecules that connect pre- and post-synaptic compartments [5]. These interactions in the synaptic cleft help to maintain synapse structure by delineating mutual boundaries [6]. These proteins are also important in synapse plasticity as synaptic cell adhesion is able to regulate the remodelling of synapses [7]. Interestingly, they are also involved in trans-synaptic signalling [5]. Thus, these proteins are highly important in the organization of synaptic junctions and overall brain function.

Neurexins are one type of synaptic cell adhesion molecule. They are pre-synaptically localized and bind to neuroligins and other proteins in the post-synapse (figure 1). Neurexins and their common binding partners, neuroligins, have recently gained more pathological interest as variants in both have been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia [8]. This further suggests that synaptic dysfunction plays a role in the development of these disorders. Synaptic dysfunction is also known to occur in neurodegenerative disorders [9]; however, it was considered an endpoint of these disorders, due to the considerably later onset of clinical symptoms and progressive appearance of cognitive deficits. This dichotomy has, recently, been challenged by the creation of ‘disease-in-a-dish’ models for multiple central nervous system (CNS) pathologies [9]. This research has identified commonalities between developmental and degenerative disorders, at both the cellular and molecular level, with most of these common mechanisms meeting at the synapse level [9]. Indeed, our laboratory has, recently, found a novel variant (p.G849D) in the NRXN2 gene which may be implicated in PD [10]. Therefore, we believe it is important to investigate the potential role of neurexins in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Figure 1. Location of neurexins and their binding partners, neuroligins, in the synapse. Several neurexin–neuroligin pathway proteins are shown as well as synaptic vesicle-binding proteins. NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; mGluR5, metabolic glutamate receptor 5; PSD-95, post-synaptic density protein 95; Shank, SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein.

In this review, we summarize some of the key physiological functions of the neurexin protein family and the protein networks they are involved in. We also examine the available published literature to determine what research has been done on neurexins in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. This analysis provides an overview on what progress has been made in understanding the roles of synaptic functioning in these disorders and reveals the gaps in knowledge in this field.

2. Structure and biological functions of neurexins

Neurexins were first identified using affinity chromatography when neurexin 1α was found in rat brain extract on a column of α-latrotoxin [11]. α-latrotoxin is a potent neurotoxin from black widow spider venom that stimulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and induces massive neurotransmitter release [12]. This work has been continued by Südhof and co-workers [13] who have characterized the neurexin proteins and their binding partners, the neuroligins [14].

In mammals, the neurexins are encoded by three NRXN genes (NRXN1-3), each of which has both an upstream promoter that is used to generate the α-neurexins, and a downstream promoter that is used to generate the shorter β-neurexins [13,15]. Neurexins also undergo extensive alternate splicing at five splice sites, generating significant diversity of more than 2000 potential variants [13,16]. The fact that neurexin splice insert sequences and their positions are well conserved among neurexin genes and between species supports the idea that alternative splicing has important functional roles.

The neurexins are transmembrane proteins that consist of an extracellular region responsible for trans-synaptic interactions, a transmembrane domain and a smaller cytoplasmic domain named PSD-95, DLG1, ZO-1 binding domain (PDZ) that is involved in intracellular protein interactions and signalling (figure 2) [13]. α-neurexins are composed of six large extracellular laminin/neurexin/sex hormone-binding (LNS) globulin domains with three interspersed epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like regions (figure 2). β-neurexins are shorter and only have the sixth extracellular LNS domain and no EGF-like regions (figure 2). Only neurexin 1 protein structures (both α and β forms) have been solved experimentally in Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Bos taurus. However, these structures have not yet been solved in humans. Figure 2. Structural domain organization of the α and β forms of neurexin. (a) α-neurexin. (b) β-neurexin. EGF, epidermal growth factor-like region; LNS, laminin/neurexin/sex hormone-binding domain; PDZ, PSD-95, DLG1, ZO-1 domain; SP, signal peptide; TM, transmembrane domain.

Neurexins are localized pre-synaptically and are distributed to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses [8]. Their functions are mediated by their binding to neuroligins (figure 1). Neuroligins have five known isoforms and are expressed post-synaptically [17]. Consequently, neurexins and neuroligins form synaptic complexes in the synaptic cleft and have been found to control synapse formation, maturation, validation and function [17]. Various combinations of the different neurexins and neuroligin binding partners at synapses may also help determine synapse specificity through differential interactions between multiple splice variants and isoforms of these proteins [8].

Primarily, neurexins function to maintain synaptic organization. Gene ontology (GO) analysis by WebGestalt (http://www.webgestalt.org) [18] of the three neurexins indicates that they all function in protein binding, ion binding and possess molecular transducer activity (figure 3). They are also involved in cellular component organization, developmental processes, response to stimuli, cell communication and biological regulation. These processes thus demonstrate how neurexins are able to maintain synaptic organization but also show their multi-functional nature. As such, it is conceivable that disruptions in neurexins could be detrimental to their various functions and affect overall neuronal function and integrity. Figure 3.

3. Biological pathways and interacting partners of neurexins

To understand the broader biological pathways that the neurexins are involved in, protein–protein interaction network analysis and co-expression analysis was performed using the tools, STRING (https://string-db.org) [19] and GeneMania (https://genemania.org) [20]. STRING finds related genes by accessing the STRING database which contains experimental data and computational predictions. Data in STRING are weighted and integrated and a confidence score of 0–1 is calculated for all interacting protein partners. GeneMANIA finds proteins related to neurexins by leveraging functional association data, such as interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. All functional data for the proteins observed in these networks were obtained from UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org) [21], unless otherwise stated, while pathway data were obtained from KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp) [22].

3.1. String analysis

Weighted string analysis was conducted on neurexin 1, 2 and 3 individually to determine their binding partners (figure 4a–c). Based on this analysis, there is strong evidence that neurexin 1 interacts with 10 proteins including calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal protein 1 (LRRTM1), LRRTM2, LRRTM3, neuroligin 1, neuroligin 2, neuroligin 3, neuroligin 4X, SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 2 (SHANK2) and synaptotagmin-1 with scores of 0.987, 0.983, 0.985, 0.975, 0.998, 0.997, 0.998, 0.997, 0.975, 0.974, respectively. Similarly, neurexins 2 and 3 also have 10 interactors each. There is strong evidence that neurexin 2 interacts with CASK, discs large homologue 4 (DLG4), LRRTM1, LRRTM2, LRRTM3, neuroligin 1, neuroligin 2, neuroligin 3, neuroligin 4X and SHANK2 with scores of 0.979, 0.977, 0.984, 0.983, 0.972, 0.998, 0.998, 0.998, 0.997 and 0.969, respectively. There is strong evidence that neurexin 3 interacts with CASK, DLG4, LRRTM1, LRRTM2, LRRTM3, neuroligin 1, neuroligin 2, neuroligin 3, neuroligin 4X and SHANK2 with scores of 0.978, 0.971, 0.979, 0.983, 0.971, 0.998, 0.997, 0.997, 0.997 and 0.969, respectively. The STRING analyses performed on the three neurexins identified interacting proteins with very high confidence scores since the lowest score across the analyses was 0.969. This means that there is strong experimental evidence that these proteins interact with one or more of the neurexins. Figure 4. Protein interacting partners of neurexins 1–3.

Analysis of the identified neurexin binding partners revealed many proteins important in the maintenance and functioning of synapses. Notably, variants in several of these proteins are implicated in neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders. Variants in neuroligin 1 and SHANK2 have been implicated in susceptibility to autism [23,24], while variants in neuroligin 3 have been implicated in Asperger syndrome and autism [25]. Variants in neuroligin 4X have been implicated in X-linked forms of Asperger syndrome, autism susceptibility and mental retardation [25–27]. Variants in CASK have been implicated in FG syndrome 4, an X-linked genetic disorder and mental retardation [28–32], variants in DLG4 have been implicated in intellectual developmental disorder 62 [33,34] and variants in synaptotagmin-1 have been implicated in Baker–Gordon syndrome [35].

Furthermore, binding partners of these proteins as well as the pathways they occur in could also give insight into the development of disease. CASK binds to amyloid precursor protein and neuroligin 1 binds to amyloid-β, both of which are important in AD. LRRTM3 is also a known positive regulator of amyloid-β formation. Notably, LRRTM3 may be considered a candidate gene for late-onset AD as it promotes the processing of amyloid precursor protein which leads to toxic amyloid-β accumulation [36]. DLG4 is involved in dopamine receptor binding and synaptotagmin-1 regulates dopamine secretion. The loss of dopamine functioning is crucial in PD. Indeed, DLG4 is involved in several pathways of neurodegeneration (in multiple diseases), the HD pathway as well as cocaine addiction.

3.2. GeneMANIA

GeneMANIA analysis was performed on the neurexins to reveal further potential protein–protein interactions (figure 4d; electronic supplementary material, table S1). We performed the analysis by selecting only proteins with stronger evidence of neurexin interactions, such as interactions with physical evidence, and evidence from co-expression and co-localization studies.

All of the binding partners observed by STRING analysis were still present; however, more interacting proteins were also identified. These proteins have more diverse functions but still function in overall synapse maintenance.

This analysis further identified afadin (AFDN), Rho GTPase activating protein 10 (ARHGAP10), cerebellin 1 (CBLN1), dystroglycan (DAG1), microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1), neurexophilin-2, neurexophilin-3, PDZ domain-containing protein 2 (PDZD2), proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1), syndecan binding protein 1 (SDCBP), SDCBP2, SH3 domain-containing GRB2-like protein 2 (SH3GL2), signal-induced proliferation-associated 1-like protein 1 (SIPA1L1), synaptotagmin-13 (SYT13) TAFA chemokine-like family member 1 (TAFA1), TUBB-like protein 1 (TULP1) and XK-related protein 4 (XKR4) as interactors of one or more neurexin proteins. AFDN, ARHGAP10, MACF1 and SIPA1L1 are all involved in actin filament binding/organization, while PDZD2, SDCBP and SDCBP2 are involved in cell binding and cytoskeletal organization. Dysregulation of any of these proteins could thus affect cell adhesion and binding at the synapse. In addition, variants in MACF1 have been implicated in lissencephaly 9 with complex brainstem malformation [37]. CBLN1 is essential for synapse integrity and plasticity and its disruption could lead to synapse dysfunction. DAG1 has multiple functions, such as laminin and basement membrane assembly, cell survival, peripheral nerve myelination, nodal structure and cell migration. Variants in DAG1 have been implicated in both type A and type C muscular dystrophy–dystroglycanopathy [38–41]. Muscular dystrophies are genetic disorders characterized by the degeneration of skeletal muscle. Type C muscular dystrophy–dystroglycanopathy affects the limb-girdle area [40], while type C is congenital with brain and eye anomalies [39]. Neurexophilin-2 and neurexophilin-3 are both ligands for α-neurexins and are involved in the neuropeptide signalling pathway. Disruption of these proteins could, therefore, affect neurotransmitter release and the subsequent signalling. PLP1 is the major myelin protein in the CNS and is important for maintaining the structure of myelin. Disruption of this protein could, therefore, negatively affect the downstream myelination of neurons, as is seen in multiple sclerosis (MS). Interestingly, PLP1 is also involved in the development of the substantia nigra, the main brain region affected by PD. Therefore, PLP1 alterations could also lead to disruptions in this brain region. SH3GL2 has been implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, while synaptotagmin-13 may be involved in transport vesicle docking to the plasma membrane. Dysregulation of these proteins could thus affect neurotransmitter functioning. TAFA1 is involved in the modulation of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation; therefore, dysregulation of this protein could result in developmental disorders. TULP1 is required for normal development of photoreceptor synapses. Variants in TULP1 are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis [42,43] and retinitis pigmentosa [42,44–47]. However, this protein is also involved in actin filament binding, therefore, its dysregulation could also affect cell adhesion and binding at the synapse. Not much is known about XKR4 except that it is involved in apoptosis during development. Therefore, its dysregulation could also possibly result in developmental disorders.

GO terms and physiological/pathway information on all binding partners identified by STRING and GeneMANIA are available in electronic supplementary material, figure S1 and table S1.

4.1. Human studies

NRXN1 has been well documented for its association with ASDs [54]. Several genetic analyses of families and populations of people with ASD have shown that copy number variations (CNVs) and de novo mutational events at the NRXN1 locus are enriched in ASD [48,49,51,52,54]. In one study, NRXN1 was sequenced in cases of ASD with mental retardation [50]. Mutations (c.–3G > T in the Kozak region, c.3G > T at the initiation codon (p.M1), p.R375Q and p.G378S) were found in the NRXN1β coding region thereby potentially implicate synapse dysfunction an important determinant in ASD [50].

The first evidence for a potential role of NRXN2 in ASD was provided by a report of a frameshift mutation within NRXN2 exon 12 (c.2733delT) in a boy with ASD and his father who had severe language delay [57]. This mutation results in a truncated neurexin 2α protein that lacks the binding sites for the established post-synaptic binding partners LRRTM2 and neuroligin 2 [57]. Subsequently, a 21-year-old man with a clinical phenotype including autistic traits, such as speech and language deficits and pathological insistence on routine, was reported to have a 570 kb de novo deletion of 24 genes at chromosome 11q13.1, including NRXN2 [58].

Using microarray analyses on RNA extracted from brain tissue, Mirnics et al. [69] did not observe a difference in neurexin 1 expression between schizophrenia (SCZ) and control samples. However, since then, a link between neurexin 1 and SCZ has been reported in other studies. One study reported that NRXN1 deletions are more common in those with SCZ; however, it also found that there was incomplete penetrance of these deletions in families with SCZ [72]. Kirov et al. [70] observed a deletion in an SCZ patient at 2p16.3 that disrupts NRXN1 and predicted that it was highly likely to be pathogenic. Also, NRXN1 deletions were shown to segregate with several neuropsychiatric disorders in a study of a complex family [78]. The proband had SCZ and other members of his family had mental retardation, schizophreniform disorder and affective disorder [78]. After genotyping the proband and eight family members, they found two rare deletions upstream of the NRXN1 gene (2p16.3) that co-segregate with these disorders [78]. Notably, this shows that deletions in NRXN1 may manifest as multiple neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

Angione et al. [64] implicated NRXN1 in epilepsy. They identified a 2p16.3 deletion in an 8-year-old male patient diagnosed with epilepsy showing symptoms of myoclonic-atonic seizures (EMAS) [64]. This deletion included the first five exons of the NRXN1 gene [64].

NRXN genes may also be involved in treatment response. In one study, it was found that variants in NRXN1 may affect the long-term treatment outcome of patients with BD by modulating the effects of antipsychotics [61]. In a study of Levetiracetam resistance, an antiepileptic drug, Grimminger et al. [63] found that neurexin 1 is differentially expressed in non-responder and responder patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), whereby lower levels of neurexin 1 were observed in responder patients.

4.1.1. Association studies

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) by Liu et al. [51] specifically examined NRXN1 in an autism cohort of the Chinese Han population and discovered 22 variants that were associated with ASD. In this cohort, one SNP (rs2303298) was also significantly associated with a risk of developing ASD [51]. Furthermore, a GWAS of SCZ in Spain showed that a NRXN1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs3850333) was close to the significance threshold [71], while another GWAS in American patients of European or African ancestry showed that NRXN1 is associated with antipsychotic response to lurasidone in SCZ patients [76]. Additionally, an association study on Spanish SCZ patients showed that missense mutations in NRXN1 may actually protect against susceptibility to SCZ [73].

In a Taiwanese GWAS study, a significant association between NRXN3 and BD was found [60]. And finally, an association study on Australian borderline personality disorder (BPD) patients showed that several NRXN3 SNPS were nominally associated with BPD in heroin-dependent cases [62].

4.2. In vitro and in vivo models of disease

Functional in vitro and in vivo studies have also found evidence for the roles of neurexins in ASD. Monoamine oxidase A knockout (KO) mice, which are an animal model for autism, exhibited downregulated levels of both neurexin 1 and neurexin 2 [55]. Furthermore, mice colonized with the microbiota of ASD patients showed differential splicing of NRXN2 [59]. Another animal study showed that changes in the binding of α-neurexins to N-type calcium channels could be important for some forms of ASD as it mediates synaptic inhibition [56]. Finally, a study using ASD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated organoids showed that neurexin 1, 2 and 3 mRNA is overexpressed in these samples [53].

One study examined neurexins in Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder with features similar to ASD, and characterized by the silencing of the FMR1 gene [79]. Individuals with Fragile X experience a range of neurodevelopmental problems, such as learning disabilities and cognitive impairment, and males are usually more severely affected. Using FMR1 KO mice, researchers probed brain sections to determine the levels of neurexin 1, 2 and 3 [66]. Interestingly, they found that neurexin 3 mRNA levels are increased in female mice but decreased in male mice and predicted that this may help explain the sex difference observed in this disorder [66].

In an animal study of SCZ, neurexin 1 was found to be downregulated [75]. This study generated iPSCs from patients with childhood-onset SCZ, differentiated them into glial cells and injected the glial cells into mice to form chimeric mice as a model organism [75]. Interestingly, an in vitro study of SCZ showed that overexpressing Calveolin-1, a potential therapeutic for SCZ, actually increased the levels of neurexin 1 as well as other proteins involved in synaptic plasticity [74].

Neurexin 2α has been implicated in epilepsy and, more specifically, in seizures. Researchers observed an increase in neurexin 2α expression in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in an induced-seizure mouse model [65]. Finally, in one study, a rat chronic mild stress model of depression was used to determine if neurexin expression was altered in major depressive disorder; however, no change in neurexin 1, 2 or 3 levels was observed [67].

So far, there have been two studies validating the effect of NRXNs in vitro, both by Pak et al. [68,77]. These studies cultured human stem cells as well as mice cells generated from NRXN1 KO mice. The first study introduced two conditional NRXN1 mutations previously seen in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD and SCZ, into human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using adeno-associated virus recombination and differentiated them into human-induced neurons (iNs) [68]. These cells were compared to cortical neurons generated from NRXN1α KO mice [68]. The second study generated iPSCs from three NRXN1 deletion SCZ patients and three controls, and again differentiated them into human iNs [77]. These cells were compared to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) from NRXN1 KO mice [77]. Both studies showed that heterozygous NRXN1 deletions were able to impair neurotransmitter release and synaptic function, and increase the levels of the synaptic scaffolding protein, CASK, in human iNs but not in mice cells [68,77]. Therefore, these studies provide evidence that NRXN1 deletions exhibit a major synaptic transmission phenotype in humans and are thus meaningful at a pathophysiological level.

In summary, these studies demonstrate a link between NRXNs and neuropsychiatric disorders such as ASD and SCZ, especially involving full or partial deletions of these genes. NRXNs have also been associated with BD and BPD. In addition, protein expression studies have shown changes in neurexin expression in animal models of epilepsy/seizures and Fragile X syndrome.

5.1. Human studies

Studies examining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients have observed lowered expression of neurexin 1 [81], as well as neurexin 2α and neurexin 3α [85]. In addition, it was found that these changes precede the neurodegeneration markers as they were observed in the preclinical stage 1 of AD [85]. Moreover, Aβ42 fibrils in CSF were found to bind to neurexin 1, 2 and 3 as well as proteoglycans and growth factors [83]. Levels of the synaptic proteins neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), GluA4-containing glutamate (AMPA4), neuroligin 1 and neurexin 2α are also declined in plasma neuron-derived exomes and this decline was associated with AD progression [82]. Neurexin 3 protein expression has also been seen to be specifically downregulated in blood samples of AD patients [84].

Another expression analysis on CSF from MS patients identified neurexin 2α levels as a potential biomarker for the disorder [98], while a genetic analysis found that a mutant miRNA, MIR8485, overexpresses neurexin, which leads to a calcium overload in pre-synapses [99]. It was hypothesized that this could induce neurodegeneration in MS [99].

A study examining gene expression in brain tissue samples of patients with PD found that genes related to nerve function, such as protocadherin-8 (PCDH8) and neurexin 3, were downregulated [109].

Two studies on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) found promising results. MCI is a milder form of dementia that is considered the intermediate state of cognitive decline between normal ageing and dementia [114]. Berchtold et al. [95] found that neurexin 1 and neurexin 2 are upregulated in MCI. In addition, neurexin 1 expression was found to be associated with longitudinal phenotypes in MCI, but not in AD [96].

One study examined neurexins in order to identify genes that are differentially regulated by HIV encephalitis [94]. This microarray study showed that neurexin 1 is downregulated in HIV encephalitis.

Finally, González-Velasco et al. [92] showed that neurexin 2 and neurexin 3 mRNA levels are downregulated in ageing. Another study found that neurexin 1, 2 and 3 underwent altered expression in both AD and ageing [86]. A more recent study from the same group confirmed decreased expression of both neurexin 1 and neurexin 3 in AD and ageing [88]. Interestingly, they also found that late-life physical activity is associated with increased expression of these proteins [88].

5.1.1. Association study

A GWAS performed by Stein et al. [80] showed that the SNP rs7155434 within NRXN3 is associated with temporal lobe structure in AD patients. Temporal lobe volume deficits are a known risk factor for AD; therefore, this study potentially implicates NRXN3 with AD risk [80].

5.2. In vitro and in vivo models of disease

Several studies involving cell culture and/or rodent disease models have also shown differences in the expression of neurexin proteins. Three studies showed that neurexin 1 is downregulated in PD. One of these measured neurexin 1 mRNA in two 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine)-induced cell culture models; one using human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells and the other using primary mouse mesencephalic cells [107]. The other studies used a 6-OHDA-induced rat model of PD and both saw a decrease in neurexin 1 in the striatum [110,112]. In addition, these studies showed that treatment with apelin-13 [112] or allopregnanolone [110] is able to attenuate this change. Apelin-13 is an endogenous ligand for APJ [115] that has been investigated as a potential protective neuropeptide due to the role of the apelin-APJ system in neuronal survival [116], while allopregnanolone is a reduced metabolite of progesterone [117] and has reduced CSF levels in PD patients [118]. Freeze et al. [111], however, noted that the expression pattern of neurexin 1 does not predict regional atrophy in PD. This suggests that neurexin 1 is not a marker for PD; however, it does not exclude it as an important protein in PD pathogenesis. Another study in PD-transgenic mice overexpressing α-synuclein found that neurexin 2 expression was also upregulated [108]. In addition, chronic administration of cholesterol oximes was able to increase the transcription of cytoprotective genes and undo transcriptome alterations, including the alteration of neurexin 2 expression [108].

Two studies using induced models of MS implicated neurexins in this disorder. One study induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats and observed downregulation of neurexin 3 [97]. This is a commonly used model that mimics certain aspects of MS. The other study used an in vitro model of MS, cultured human monocytes, and observed an association between ceramide-induced hypermethylation of DNA and neurexin 1 mRNA [100].

An animal study performed by Neuner et al. [87] showed that neurexin 3 is downregulated in AD-transgenic mice, but not in normal aged mice with impaired memory. However, Popesco et al. [89] found that neurexin 3 is downregulated in the cerebellum of aged mice. Another study found that levels of both neurexin 1 and neuroligin 3 are differentially expressed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice and that these expression levels change during different stages of ageing [91]. They predicted that this may be responsible for the changes in synaptic plasticity observed with age [91]. Finally, a DNA methylation study by Tserel et al. [90] showed that CpG sites associated with NRP1, NRXN2 and miR-29b-2 are hypomethylated in monocytes during ageing.

To date, only one study has examined neurexins in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). In a cell culture model of ALS, neurexin 1 and other RNA targets of TDP-43 were dysregulated [93]. TDP-43 is a component of the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies present in ALS patients [93]. Fragments of TDP-43 are ubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated and then accumulate in neurons and glia [119]. In zebrafish and mouse KO models of SMA, the SMN-deficiency downregulated neurexin 2α expression and altered its splicing [113]. SMA is associated with mutation or deletions in the SMN gene [120] and lack of the SMN protein causes degeneration and results in anterior horn cell dysfunction.

5.3. Models of induced neurodegeneration and toxicity

Several studies investigated neurexins in models of neurodegeneration or toxicity instead of studying a specific neurodegenerative disease.

Four studies examined the role of neurexins in models of induced neurodegeneration. Two of these studies hypothesized that neurexin 1 could play a role in neurodegeneration. The first study showed that a novel TDP-43 binding miRNA, miR-NID1 (miR-8485) is able to repress neurexin 1 and predicted that this could play a role in neurodegeneration [103]. Xiang et al. [104] found in vitro that excessive glycosylated acetylcholinesterase could competitively disrupt the neurexin 1β-neuroligin junctions and impair the integrity of glutamatergic synapses, which could lead to neurodegeneration. The other two studies showed that neurexin 3 is downregulated in animal models of neurodegeneration [101,102]. Suh et al. [102] saw that neurexin 3 was downregulated in the hippocampus of mice treated with kainic acid, an inducer of neurodegeneration, while Swanberg et al. [101] found that neurexin 3 is downregulated in rats with axonal damage caused by ventral root avulsion.

Two studies were conducted in animal models of neurotoxicity. One study exposed zebrafish to chronic, low levels of the neurotoxin domoic acid and saw an upregulation of neurexin 2α after two weeks [106]. The other study exposed rats to acute doses of sarin, which caused a persistent downregulation of neurexin 1β and breakdown of the blood–brain barrier [105].

In summary, multiple studies have shown changes in neurexin expression in AD, ALS, MS, PD and SMA. Many of these studies have observed downregulation of protein expression for neurexin 1, 2 and 3 in these disorders. Similarly, downregulation of neurexin 1, 2 and 3 were observed in disorders such as HIV encephalitis and MCI and in studies on ageing, in models of neuronal toxicity, and animal models of MS and ALS.

6. Concluding remarks

A clear link between synaptic dysfunction and neurodegenerative as well as neuropsychiatric disorders has been established in recent years. Our literature-based searches revealed several studies that have linked CNVs, deletions or expression changes in neurexins to different disorders. The evidence is most compelling for a role of neurexins in neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly in regard to the involvement of neurexin 1 in ASD and SCZ. Currently, there is comparatively less evidence for the involvement of neurexins in neurodegenerative disorders. Although there have been some studies that have suggested that neurexins may be important in these disorders, at this stage more experimental data are still needed to draw concrete conclusions. Therefore, it is apparent that more targeted studies in various disorders involving these genes as well as the proteins they encode are warranted. In terms of their broader biological and physiological functions, the neurexins function as molecular inducers, are involved in iron and protein binding, and play a role in cell-to-cell communication and response to stimuli, consequently making them critical for normal cell functioning. Furthermore, these proteins interact with various other proteins such as the neuroligins and the LRRTM proteins identified via protein interaction networks. This implicates the neurexins’ involvement in synaptic integrity and functioning making them promising candidates as disease genes for a wide range of brain pathologies.

In summary, this review serves to highlight the potential importance of the neurexin genes and proteins in human disease and recommends that more targeted studies on these genes and proteins are warranted. Furthermore, with the wealth of exomic and genomic sequences and genome-wide transcriptomic datasets now available, it has become plausible to interrogate them for their involvement in various human disorders, on a scale not previously possible. In addition, the human neurexin protein structures urgently need to be solved to understand the function and infer accurate protein–protein interactions as well as to understand the effect of mutations on the protein structure. Ultimately, improved knowledge on synapses and their individual components are necessary to develop novel therapeutic approaches for the emerging and exciting field of synaptopathies.
