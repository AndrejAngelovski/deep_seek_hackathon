To facilitate the development of large-scale transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) that may enable in-silico analyses of disease mechanisms, a reliable catalogue of experimentally verified direct transcriptional regulatory interactions (DTRIs) is needed for training and validation. There has been a long history of using low-throughput experiments to validate single DTRIs. Therefore, we reason that a reliable set of DTRIs could be produced by curating the published literature for such evidence. In our survey of previous curation efforts, we identified the lack of details about the quantity and the types of experimental evidence to be a major gap, despite the theoretical importance of such details for the identification of bona fide DTRIs. We developed a curation protocol to inspect the published literature for support of DTRIs at the experiment level, focusing on genes important to the development of the mammalian nervous system. We sought to record three types of low-throughput experiments: Transcription factor (TF) perturbation, TF-DNA binding, and TF-reporter assays. Using this protocol, we examined a total of 1,310 papers to assemble a collection of 1,499 unique DTRIs, involving 251 TFs and 825 target genes, many of which were not reported in any other DTRI resource. The majority of DTRIs (965; 64%) were supported by two or more types of experimental evidence and 27% were supported by all three. Of the DTRIs with all three types of evidence, 170 had been tested using primary tissues or cells and 44 had been tested directly in the central nervous system. We used our resource to document research biases among reports towards a small number of well-studied TFs. To demonstrate a use case for this resource, we compared our curation to a previously published high-throughput perturbation screen and found significant enrichment of the curated targets among genes differentially expressed in the developing brain in response to Pax6 deletion. This study demonstrates a proof-of-concept for the assembly of a high resolution DTRI resource to support the development of large-scale TRNs.

Author summary

The capacity to computationally reconstruct gene regulatory networks using large-scale biological data is currently limited by the absence of a high confidence set of one-to-one regulatory interactions. Given the lengthy history of using small scale experimental assays to investigate individual interactions, we reason that a reliable collection of gene regulatory interactions could be compiled by systematically inspecting the published literature. To this end, we developed a curation protocol to examine and record evidence of regulatory interactions at the individual experiment level. Focusing on the area of brain development, we applied our pipeline to 1,310 publications. We identified 3,601 individual experiments, providing detailed information about 1,499 regulatory interactions. Many of these interactions have verified activity specifically in the embryonic brain. By capturing reports of regulatory interactions at this level of detail, we equip the users with more granular information than other similar resources, enabling more informed assessments of reliability.

pmcIntroduction

Reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) has the potential to enable in-silico analysis of developmental processes and disease mechanisms. As such, using high-throughput biological data to infer large scale TRNs is an area under active research; recent examples include [1–4]. However, the utility of these TRNs has been hindered by the absence of a high confidence set of regulatory interactions for training and validation. Researchers have historically used less scalable experimental techniques to investigate direct transcriptional regulatory interactions (DTRIs). While low-throughput, such methods tend to be considered reliable, especially if there are multiple independent lines of evidence supporting a DTRI. Thus, there would be value in having resources that aggregate high-quality reports of DTRIs, forming the topic of the current work. Our particular interest is in DTRIs of relevance to the developing nervous system, as mutations in transcription factor (TF) genes [5–7] and regulatory regions [8–10] have been highly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders.

We define DTRIs as pairwise interactions between a transcription factor (TF) and a target gene where the TF modulates target expression by associating with a cis-regulatory element (cRE). In the interest of inclusivity, we are defining direct regulation to broadly include both scenarios where the TF binds directly to DNA via its DNA binding domain or by interacting with other TFs. This definition of “directness” is in contrast with “indirect regulation” where two or more DTRIs act in series in a pathway. There are three types of low-throughput experimental paradigms commonly used to elucidate DTRIs, including TF perturbation, TF-DNA binding, and TF-reporter assays (Fig 1A). In TF perturbation assays, manipulation of TF expression is followed by an assessment of target gene expression. In TF-DNA binding assays, protein-DNA interactions between the TF and the cRE are evaluated. Finally, TF-reporter assays measure the functional impact of the TF binding on the associated cRE sequence. While low-throughput assays are not infallible, they generally yield higher confidence than high-throughput alternatives by evading the need for large scale inferential statistics and enabling detailed and readily replicable characterization of single DTRIs; examples: [11,12] (Fig 1B). Notably, such low-throughput experiments are routinely used to validate putative targets identified by more scalable approaches. Given the importance and wide acceptance of these types of evidence, it would be useful to assemble a centralized catalogue of DTRIs that is supported by low-throughput experimental evidence in the published literature.

(C) Overall curation workflow. The count of papers and the corresponding number of TFs in each stage of curation are printed. Summary statistics of the final curation output are displayed at the bottom (D) The manually curated regulatory network. TFs are diamond shaped and colored blue. Targets are circles and colored orange. The sizes of TFs correspond to the number of targets. TFs with 10 or more targets are labeled with the official HGNC gene symbol. Edge transparency corresponds to the number of types of experiments. Red edges represent DTRIs with experimental validation in primary CNS tissues or cells. Only the largest network component with 946 nodes and 1481 edges is displayed.

There have been a number of earlier efforts to aggregate DTRIs from the literature: ENdb: [13], TRRUST: [14,15], CytReg: [16], OReganno: [17–19], HTRIdb: [20], TFe: [21], TFactS: [22], InnateDB: [23]. None of these curation efforts were tailored to the neurodevelopment context. More importantly, these studies generally record annotations of pairs of interacting genes but capture little information about the underlying experimental evidence. This is notable because the type and quantity of evidence is expected to affect the reliability of a reported interaction. Specifically, each individual type of evidence provides only a limited view of any given DTRI. TF perturbation assays enable the assessment of the TF’s ability to modulate target gene expression but cannot decipher its functional dependence on physical binding. Likewise, while TF binding at a cRE is necessary for regulation, detection of TF-DNA binding alone is insufficient for demonstrating functional activity. TF-reporter assays simultaneously demonstrate both functional modulation and physical binding but often by examining the given DTRI outside of the native genomic and cellular context. As such, integration across these types of experiments should help establish DTRIs with high confidence.

Driven by the premise that curation of details at the individual experiment level would facilitate accurate evaluation of reliability, we undertook a systematic effort to inspect the literature in this way. Consequently, the resulting resource contains more granular information about the experimental evidence underlying each report of DTRI than other similar resources, enabling users to make more informed and independent assessment of confidence. Finally, our curation effort provides a partial summary snapshot of the literature landscape surrounding transcriptional regulation in the developing brain.

Results

Overview of curation

Our curation pipeline is summarized in Fig 1C (see S1 Appendix for details). Briefly, for each TF, we assembled a set of candidate papers (S1 Data). Next, we manually prioritized TFs for curation based on annotated associations with central nervous system (CNS) development and the number of candidate papers retrieved (S2 Data). For each paper examined, we recorded the details of all reported experiments that lend support to any DTRI in humans or mice (Box 1 and S3 Data). For reporting, we mapped all genes to human orthologs while retaining the species information as an additional feature. Applying this pipeline to a total of 1,310 papers, we established a collection of 1,499 unique DTRIs, involving 251 TFs and 825 targets, from 828 papers. This manually curated network is displayed in Fig 1D and the complete set of curated interactions are provided in S4 Data. In the following sections, we present a detailed summary of the curated data resource and compare it to a high-throughput TF perturbation screen.

1Different sets of details are recorded for different types of experiments. 2Constitutive perturbation refers to mutations that are present throughout the course of development, as opposed to induced perturbations using Cre-loxP or RNA interference that are triggered closer to the time of assay. 3The TF protein used in EMSA experiments may be sourced differently across experiments. In many cases, it is obtained from cell lines after TF transfection. In other cases, nuclear extracts containing the endogenous protein are obtained from primary tissues or cells. 4For TF-reporter assays where the cRE sequence is mutated and tested, the impact of the mutation on TF-DNA binding is sometimes verified using additional EMSA experiments.

Identification of candidate papers highlights biases in TF coverage

The input to our curation was a corpus of candidate publications. To establish this corpus, we started by taking advantage of previous curation efforts. We obtained 14,364 papers from seven external resources, covering 1,305 TFs (Fig 2A and S1 Data). TRRUST, the largest database of literature curated DTRIs, provided more than 10,000 publications but only recovered about ~30% of those recorded in the other resources (Fig 2B and 2C). Further, overlaps among the other resources are generally small (0%-22%). These observations suggest that there may be additional papers in the literature containing reports of DTRIs. As such, we expanded the pool of candidate papers by searching PubMed using several relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms (see Methods for details). We identified an additional set of 6,989 candidate papers for 1,140 TFs (Fig 2A). In particular, for TFs directly associated with CNS development, we were able to increase the total number of candidate papers from 5,729 to 9,839. Together, we assembled a set of 21,353 candidate papers covering 1,486 TFs.

(A) Venn diagrams showing the overlap between candidate papers sourced from external data resources versus our independent PubMed query, broken down by all TFs (top) and those associated with neurodevelopmental TFs (bottom) (B) Number of candidate papers retrieved from each data resource. Papers associated with neurodevelopmental TFs are highlighted in blue. (C) Pairwise overlap of candidate papers among the different sources shown as fractions of the “target” source (horizontal axis). For example, TRRUST contains 0.48 of the papers recorded in CytReg whereas CytReg contains only 0.05 of the papers in TRRUST. Only values of 0.05 or higher are displayed. External resources are ordered by the number of recorded publications. (D) Summary of associations between TFs and candidate papers. Each point on the left vertical axis is a TF, ordered by the number of candidate papers assigned (TFs with the highest number of candidate papers are at the bottom). Neurodevelopmental TFs are highlighted in blue. Each point on the right vertical axis is a candidate paper, ordered by the number of associated TF (papers with the highest number of candidate papers are at the bottom). Each line denotes a TF-paper association. For example, TBR1 (highlighted) is associated with eight candidate papers (red lines), the PubMed IDs of three papers are printed as examples.

We assessed coverage of TFs among the retrieved set of candidate papers. We found that 90% of all the publications recorded in previous curation databases were covered by the top 316 TFs. Similarly, 90% of all candidate papers queried from PubMed were covered by the top 289 TFs. The set of top TFs in previous curation databases overlaps substantially with the set of top TFs identified in our independent PubMed query (Jaccard Index = 0.52), suggesting shared biases. The overall pattern is shown in Fig 2D. Further, a substantial fraction of TFs (749; 34%) had no candidate papers. Importantly, some key neurodevelopmental TFs appear to have had very limited investigation. For example, TBR1 is a TF recently implicated in Intellectual Disability (ID) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [24]. Despite this, we were able to identify only eight candidate papers for this gene (Fig 2D), suggesting that TBR1 was not previously popular enough to warrant much attention. We hypothesized that this bias in TF coverage reflects gene popularity differences in general. As expected, we found that the total number of papers per TF in PubMed is highly correlated with the number of candidate papers retrieved (Spearman’s correlation = 0.86). As we discuss later, these biases in the literature influence the resulting database of interactions and its interpretation.

Identification of 1,499 experimentally verified TF-target interactions

In total, we recorded 3,601 experiments by examining 1,310 research publications, providing high resolution evidence for 1,499 unique DTRIs involving 251 TFs and 825 targets (Fig 3A and S3 Data). A small fraction (204; 14%) of all DTRIs were supported by evidence in both humans and mice (Fig 3A). About half (798; 53%) were reported only for mice and the remainder (497; 33%) only for humans. We were able to annotate 39 TFs with 10 or more DTRIs (Fig 3C). Collectively, these top 39 TFs regulate more than half (1018; 68%) of all curated DTRIs. The remaining 481 (32%) DTRIs were distributed across 212 TFs (S1 Fig). Unsurprisingly given our TF selection criteria, 31 of the top 39 TFs, are associated with neurodevelopment (Fig 3C). Notably, PAX6, a key TF implicated in corticogenesis [25,26] has 63 recorded targets. Further, we identified 12 targets with ten or more recorded TF regulators (S2 Fig). Eight of these 12 targets are themselves neurodevelopmental TFs including HES1, ASCL1, NEUROG2, MEF2C among others (S3 Fig). In particular, HES1, a TF known to be involved in the proliferation of neural progenitors [27], has 14 experimentally verified TF regulators.

Color coding is the same as in (B). Neurodevelopmental TFs are indicated by blue circles. There are 39 TFs with more than ten targets (denoted by the horizontal dotted line).

Next, we looked at the overall patterns of experimental evidence underlying the recorded DTRIs. TF-DNA binding experiments were most common (1,463), followed by 1,208 TF perturbation and 930 TF-reporter assays (Fig 3A). The majority of all three types of experiments have been performed using immortalized cell lines (2,181 experiments) rather than primary tissues or cells (951 experiments). This was especially true for reporter assays where close to 95% (876/930) of the experiments were performed using cell lines (Fig 3A). Despite the overall small number of experiments using primary tissue or cells, close to half of all DTRIs (620; 41%) were validated using at least one such experiment. Further, we found that the majority (965; 64%) of DTRIs were supported by two or more types of evidence and 398 (27%) DTRIs were supported by all three (Fig 3B). Of the DTRIs with all three types of evidence, 170 had been tested using primary tissues or cells and 44 had been tested directly in the CNS (Fig 3B).

For each type of experiment, we further explored a number of factors that may influence reliability of the reported DTRI (Box 1). For instance, the majority (845; 70%) of TF perturbation experiments recorded were performed by knocking down or knocking out TF expression, as opposed to inducing TF overexpression (363; 30%) (S4 Fig and S5 Data). Further, in TF perturbation experiments that use primary tissues or cells, we found that it is common (373 experiments) to induce a constitutive loss-of-function mutation in the TF and then compare the resulting target gene expression to that of wildtype samples (S4 Fig). The presence or absence of genetic manipulation throughout the organism’s development introduces an additional layer of complexity for interpretation. Of the 550 TF perturbation experiments performed using primary tissues or cells, 177 (32%) induced the perturbation closer to the time of assay by employing strategies such as Cre-LoxP or RNA interference. For TF-DNA binding experiments, we found that the majority of experiments (994; 68%) used chromatin immunoprecipitation to test for in-vivo binding events in either primary samples (345 experiments) or immortalized cell lines (649 experiments) (S5 Fig and S6 Data). EMSAs were also commonly employed to test for in-vitro TF protein-DNA interactions (469 experiments). Further, we found a small number of EMSA experiments (48) that used proteins obtained by nuclear extractions from primary tissues or cells (S5 Fig and S6 Data). Finally, for TF-reporter experiments, we recorded whether mutated versions of the TFBS sequence were assayed to confirm a direct binding mechanism. We found that 407 of the 930 reporter gene assays examined the functional consequence of mutating the corresponding TFBS sequence (S6 Fig and S7 Data). Overall, the granularity of our curation highlighted a wide range in the quality and quantity of evidence supporting the reported DTRIs.

Our curation also accounted for tissues and cell types, which we recorded at the highest resolution possible with existing ontologies. This allows subdivision of the data in terms of relevance to particular contexts. In total, 951 (26%) experiments recorded (for 620 DTRIs) were performed using primary tissues or cells. In terms of anatomical systems, among these experiments, the most represented was the CNS, with 243 experiments (155 DTRIs) (S7 Fig). The set of DTRIs in the CNS is highly enriched for neurodevelopmental TFs (p-value < 5.6x10-9, hypergeometric test). Further, a large fraction (181; 74%) of these experiments used embryonic CNS samples, thus providing evidence of activity in the developing CNS (S7 Fig). For example, ASCL1, FGF19, and SOX2 were reported to regulate targets in the embryonic telencephalon [28], diencephalon [29], and neural stem cells [30], respectively. We also found some DTRIs involving known neurodevelopmental TFs that were assayed only in other tissues, such as a small number of PAX6 targets in pancreatic islets [31,32] and small and large intestine [33]. Over half (2,181; 60%) of all experiments were performed in cell lines, regardless of the experiment type (Fig 3A). Among these, the most popular were kidney derived cell lines (S8 Fig). As expected, cell line experiments accounted for a larger proportion of human samples compared to primary tissue or cells (Fig 3A). Our detailed information about cellular contexts allows efficient and accurate data subdivision based on user requirements.

Next, we assessed overlaps with other DTRI resources. Since we sourced many candidate papers directly from such earlier curation efforts, a significant amount of overlap is expected. By examining 657 previously curated papers, we managed to extract 809 DTRIs from 467 papers but failed to identify low-throughput experimental evidence in the remaining 190 papers (Fig 4A and S1 Data). At the level of DTRIs, 40% of our database overlaps with TRRUST while other resources contain up to 8% of our records (S9 Fig). Limited overlap is common among the other resources as well, with the overwhelming majority of DTRIs having been recorded only in a single database (Fig 4B). This demonstrates the general incomplete coverage of the literature even by the most comprehensive curation efforts to date. Despite being smaller than most other resources (Fig 4C), we still managed to identify 775 DTRIs that were not previously curated in any other database, 541 of which directly involved a neurodevelopmental TF (Fig 4D). Importantly, 449 (58%) of these newly identified interactions were supported by multiple lines of experimental evidence (Fig 4E). Taken together, our curation has expanded the repertoire of annotated DTRIs among the existing DTRI data resources.

(E) Breakdown of DTRIs unique to our curation across different combinations of experiment types. Colors correspond to cellular contexts indicated in the color legend.

Because we curated only a fraction of the literature, it is of interest to estimate the total number of DTRI reports with low-throughput experimental evidence in the remainder. We base our estimate on the observation that of the 1,310 candidate papers that we examined, 63% (828) were found to contain at least one report of DTRI. It follows that approximately >12,000 of the remaining 20,043 candidate papers contain experimental evidence of DTRI. With an average of 1.9 DTRIs reported by any single publication (S10 Fig), there would be >22,000 DTRIs remaining in the literature, in addition to the 1,499 DTRIs already curated. Limiting to the 8,730 candidate papers annotated with neurodevelopmental TFs, there would be >10,000 more DTRIs. As noted above, we found that under a third (398/1,499) of all recorded DTRIs were supported by all three types of experimental evidence. Further, about half (170) of these high confidence DTRIs had been tested in primary tissues or cells, and of these, 44 were tested directly in the CNS. Assuming the set of candidate papers is representative, there would be around >6,000 (0.3*22,000) more DTRIs that are supported by all three types of evidence and >600 (0.03*22,000) of these would have been tested using primary CNS tissues or cells. By extension, we estimate our curation of 44 DTRIs with high confidence verification of activity in the CNS captures up to 7% of all such DTRIs reported in the literature. Taken together, we estimate that there remain many thousands of additional high-confidence DTRIs in the published literature which could be the subject of future curation efforts.

Network properties reflect potential research biases

Given the literature biases in coverage of TFs (Fig 2D), we suspected that similar biases may exist in the selection of regulatory targets. Specifically, researchers may be more likely to choose to investigate interactions between genes that are suspected to be related. If this is true, the manually curated network should be more connected than expected if the targets were chosen randomly. To test this, we integrated all DTRIs in our database to construct a directed network consisting of 955 nodes and 1,499 edges (Fig 1D). We measured network connectivity in three ways. First, we counted the number of valid gene-to-gene paths in the network. Briefly, for every gene in the network, we counted the number of other genes that are within reach via at least one continuous path. The total count was then obtained by summing across all genes. Because the edges are directed and the network consists of multiple components, not every gene is reachable from every other gene in the network. In total, we observed more than 77,000 gene-to-gene paths in the curated network, which is significantly higher than the mean of 55,411 paths among a null constructed from random networks (p-value < 0.01; see Methods). This indicates a high degree of global connectivity within the network. Next, we counted the number of cliques with three or more nodes, ignoring directionality. We found 215 cliques in the curated network, which is higher than a mean of 140 cliques among the random networks (p-value < 0.01), demonstrating a large number of locally interconnected modules. Finally, we observed only four independent components in the curated network whereas a typical random network had 26 components (p-value < 0.01), implying that even peripheral genes with low node degrees remain connected to the rest of the network. Taken together, the manually curated network is highly interconnected, even after controlling for biases in TF coverage. This strongly suggests substantial biases in the selection of targets by investigators, as observed for TF selection.

Continuing our investigation of biases in the data, we hypothesized that TSS proximal cREs would be enriched among the reported DTRIs since distal elements are likely more difficult to identify. We define proximal regulatory elements to be either promoters or regulatory elements that fall within 2 kb of the target TSS, as indicated by the original publication. The 2 kb threshold was previously used by ENCODE to classify proximal vs. distal enhancers [34]. We found that most (604 of 663 DTRIs where the TFBS position was annotated) of the reported DTRIs involve proximal cREs and only 74 DTRIs have been annotated with distal regulatory sites (S11 and S12 Figs; this observation is independent of the 2 kb threshold that we chose; S13 Fig). Distal sites include the interaction between SOX2 and SHH where the corresponding enhancers are >5 kb away from the TSS [35]. Such cases are, by far, the minority in our curation. In addition to TFBS proximity, we also annotated whether a regulatory interaction is activating or repressive, referred to as the mode of regulation (Box 1). We found that about less than a third (313/1,317) of the DTRIs are repressive (S11 Fig). It is less clear whether this trend reflects underlying biological trends or another form of investigator bias in the selection of interactions to study. Notably, several repressive DTRIs involve TFs that are generally characterized as repressors including HES1, GLI3, and REST (S14 Fig). In particular, HES1 was annotated to repress 16 of its 26 targets (among the 23 targets where the mode of regulation was reported). The majority of other TFs have been found to upregulate the expression of the majority of their target genes. For example, RUNX1 represents a typical example that activates expression of 80% (30/37) of its recorded targets. A small number (23) of DTRIs have been reported to be both activating and repressive in different experiments. Overall, of all 581 DTRIs where both the mode of regulation and the cRE positions are known, 416 (72%) involve activation of proximal cREs and only 10 (<2%) are repression of a distal cRE.

Comparison with high throughput TF perturbation screens

One application of our curated DTRI resource is to benchmark high-throughput screens. To demonstrate this use case, we analyzed a previously published TF perturbation screen for Pax6 (Fig 5A). In this study, the authors sought to identify Pax6 targets in the embryonic mouse forebrain by examining genome wide differential expression between wildtype and Pax6 mutant mice using microarrays [36]. We assessed enrichment of our curated PAX6/Pax6 targets in this dataset (this includes targets validated in either humans or mice). We found that 22 of all 56 curated PAX6/Pax6 targets were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 (p-value < 4.4x10-6, hypergeometric test; similar results were obtained with a threshold-free comparison (S15 Fig)). Among these include several known neurodevelopmental genes such as ASCL1, SOX2, and NEUROG2 (Fig 5A). We conclude there is significant correspondence between the curated targets and the high-throughput differential expression screen.

Genes differentially expressed at FDR of 0.1 are bolded and underlined. (B) Volcano plot of differential expressions between wildtype and Pax6-Sey mouse embryonic forebrains. Curated PAX6/pax6 targets are highlighted with tissue specificity as depicted in the color legend. Fold change (log2) is displayed in x-axis. Multiple test corrected q-values (Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure) are plotted on the y-axis on a log10 scale. Dotted line indicates 0.1 FDR for reference. Curated CNS targets are highly overrepresented in the differentially expression profile (p-value < 8.5x10-9, hypergeometric test) whereas no overrepresentation was detected for the targets in the “Other” category (p-value < 0.47, hypergeometric test).

In the analysis above, we ignored context, but it is plausible that low-throughput experiments performed in the same tissue as Walcher et al., 2013 [36] would yield even higher correspondence. To test for this, we divided the PAX6/Pax6 targets into three tissue types: the CNS, the eye, and “other”, with the latter containing mostly DTRIs validated in cell lines. Since the differential expression profile was generated in the embryonic mouse forebrain, we hypothesized that the targets supported by low-throughput CNS evidence would be most highly enriched. We found that this is indeed the case. Thirteen of 18 CNS targets were differentially expressed at an FDR of 0.1 (p-value < 8.5x10-9, hypergeometric test) (Fig 5B). This is nearly a twofold improvement over the set of all curated PAX6/Pax6 targets and six-fold over those in the “other” category where only two of 16 targets were differentially expressed (p-value < 0.47, hypergeometric test) (Fig 5A and 5B). Again, this observation was corroborated by an additional threshold-free analysis (S16 Fig). Further, we confirmed that the increase in the level enrichment for CNS targets over the set of all PAX6/Pax6 targets and those in the “other” category were statistically significant by using a resampling strategy to estimate the 95th percentile confidence intervals of the enrichment values (S17 Fig). Using the same strategy, we found that the CNS targets were also significantly more enriched than the targets recorded in TRRUST, which expectedly had a similar level of enrichment as the set of all PAX6/Pax6 targets in our resource (S17 Fig). Finally, the level of enrichment for targets validated in the eye is approximately the same as the set of all targets (7 of 22 targets were differentially expressed at FDR of 0.1; p-value < 1.5x10-2, hypergeometric test). Similar to cellular contexts, the level of enrichment was higher for the targets with multiple types of recorded experiments (19 of 40 targets differentially expressed at FDR of 0.1; p-value = 4.2x10-7, hypergeometric test) than those with only a single type (3 of 16 targets differentially expressed at FDR of 0.1; p-value = 0.24) (Figs 5A and S18). We were able to replicate these general patterns using an alternative Pax6 perturbation dataset that was generated using the embryonic mouse cortex [37], though the differences did not pass the threshold for statistical significance (S19 and S20 Figs). This is consistent with possible differences in data quality among high-throughput datasets. Taken together, this analysis demonstrates the utility of having detailed experimental and contextual information for the evaluation of high-throughput screens.

Next, we asked whether the level of correspondence generalizes to TFs other than PAX6/Pax6. To do this, we sourced 53 high-throughput TF perturbation datasets for 10 TFs from KnockTF [38]. We only considered TFs with 3 or more TF perturbation datasets. KnockTF contains a heterogenous set of tissue and cell types including both primary tissue or cells and immortalized cell lines. To reduce noise and control for differences in conditions among the individual datasets, we generated consensus p-value rankings for each TF by averaging across all corresponding datasets. This allowed us to compute a single AUROC enrichment value for the curated targets in each TF. In eight out of the 10 TFs, the level of enrichment improved in the consensus ranking over the median level of enrichment across the individual datasets, confirming the validity of the aggregation approach (S21 Fig). Importantly, the level of enrichment reached statistical significance for 4 of the 10 TFs, corroborating signals of correspondence between the curated targets and high-throughput TF perturbation screens beyond PAX6/Pax6. The level of enrichment is notable given the sparse coverage of our curation and the expected level of noise in the high-throughput datasets. To compare with other DTRI resources, we obtained an additional set of 123 TF perturbation datasets for 27 other TFs. This allowed us to compute AUROC enrichment values for all DTRI resource and TF combinations where there are 10 or more targets. Note that this analysis is constrained by the limited coverage of targets among the DTRI resources. For example, ENdb has 10 or more targets in the consensus p-value ranking of only a single TF (FOXA1) among all the TFs considered (S13 Data). Based on this limited set of comparisons, we found that the level of correspondence with high-throughput perturbation data is generally comparable among the various DTRI resources (S22 Fig).

Discussion

The elucidation of the genetic circuits underpinning neurodevelopmental disorders has been a major challenge. While there has been progress in the development of TRN reconstruction methods using high-throughput data, it is reasonable to ask how much has already been captured in the lengthy history of low-throughput experiments, and to make maximal use of this information. Because low-throughput methods appear to be considered reliable (they are often used to validate high-throughput methods), especially when there are multiple lines of evidence, having a high-quality assembly of such data would be beneficial. In our survey of previous efforts to produce such resource, we identified the lack of detail about the amount and type of low-throughput evidence to be a major gap. To this end, we undertook a systematic and detailed effort to inspect the published literature for support of DTRIs at the individual experiment level. We demonstrated the utility of the available annotations in our resource by comparing with high-throughput perturbation datasets. Here, we release the result of our curation for use by the wider research community.

The significance of having experiment level details is emphasized by our observation of the variation in confidence levels across the reported DTRIs in the published literature. A summary analysis of our database has revealed that only a fraction of all reported DTRIs is supported by all three types of experimental evidence. Similarly, most experiments were carried out using cell lines that may not recapitulate in-vivo activity. Even within a single type of experiment, we observed important differences in approach that may further impact reliability. This pattern of varied confidence among the reported DTRIs was largely unreported in previous curation efforts. The practical utility of our curation is further demonstrated by the comparison with the high-throughput Pax6 perturbation screen. The significantly higher levels of enrichment among the targets verified directly in the CNS and by multiple evidence types further confirms that our curation approach is appropriate for compiling bona fide DTRIs in the low-throughput literature.

Among all the external resources reviewed, CytReg [16] and ENdb [13] were the only studies with explicit consideration of different types of experimental evidence. In CytReg, the authors classified experiments into functional or binding assays, abstracting away other details that may further impact reliability. In ENdb, the authors focused on the annotation of enhancers, with limited curation of details on specific TF-target interactions. TFe, on the other hand, took a more implicit approach to account for reliability [21]. Instead of using a systematic curation approach, TFe relied on annotations of TF-target interactions by community experts, who in turn evaluate the merits of individual studies on an ad hoc basis. A recent report provided evidence to support the quality of the DTRIs recorded in TFe [39]. However, the fractured curation process makes this approach have questionable scalability. TRRUST is the largest literature-based resource to date [14,15]. Using a semi-automated text mining approach, TRRUST recorded pairs of interacting genes from publication abstracts, purposely overlooking the underlying experimental details. The remaining databases including OReganno [17–19], HTRIdb [20], TFactS [22], and InnateDB [23] rely on single experiments, which is mostly commonly the TF-DNA binding assay, to indicate direct regulation. Importantly, many of these resources included high-throughput evidence, either purposely or unintentionally. Finally, except for InnateDB and ENdb, none of the previous curation efforts recorded information about the cellular context.

There are still a number of limitations to our work. In general, manual curation can have errors. In order to minimize mistakes, we established and strictly followed a formal curation protocol (S1 Appendix). In particular, we introduced controlled vocabularies for all recorded attributes to simplify the curation process. All records were checked twice, and any conflicts were resolved by the first author. Next, incomplete retrieval of candidate papers is a potential concern. While we strived to find as many papers as possible using both previous curation resources and independent PubMed queries, it is plausible that we have missed some candidate papers given our selection of and reliance on the MeSH search terms. Nonetheless, the pronounced popularity biases we report are unlikely to be an artifact of our search strategy. Further, since we aimed to curate only a handful of DTRIs for a small set of TFs of interest, an incomplete pool of candidate papers was not a major issue. However, for a more comprehensive curation effort with the goal of increasing coverage of less popular TFs, it is possible that a future study may benefit from using more elaborate text mining approaches for retrieving candidate papers.

In order to establish a direct binding mechanism for regulatory interactions with the highest possible confidence, the effect of modifying cREs in their endogenous chromosomal loci should be considered. Emerging studies are using CRISPR-KRAB and related approaches to perform this analysis; recent examples include [40,41]. However, such studies are few, and therefore have not been included in our curation protocol. Instead, we focused only on the three most commonly reported types of experimental evidence. In the future, it may be possible to integrate such data types in order to improve reliability beyond current standards.

The lack of a negative set may limit the utility of this resource for validation. For example, in the PAX6/Pax6 analysis we could only assess sensitivity of the high-throughput perturbation study with respect to our database, not specificity. This is because our attempts to find negative examples was largely unsuccessful. During curation, we took note of any TF perturbation or TF-reporter experiments that yielded negative results in the papers that we examined. We only found 11 such cases (S11 Data). There are two possible reasons for this. First, our search for candidate papers may be biased against experiments with negative results. If this is the case, it may be possible to improve the search strategy to identify more relevant papers. However, it is more plausible that the literature itself is depleted of negative reports, due to “the file-drawer problem” [42]. Future work should attempt to identify negative examples by performing further experimentation or by developing alternative heuristics.

It is also important to emphasize that the network we obtained here cannot and should not be used for large scale biological inference, because the structure of the network is strongly influenced by research biases and the relationship with the true regulatory network is very uncertain. The highly skewed TF coverage among the candidate papers, coupled with the correlation between the number of candidate papers and gene popularity implies that researchers generally choose to study DTRIs involving TFs of previously known significance. Conversely, some genes, such as TBR1, are functionally important but lack experimental characterization, perhaps due to their more recently discovered functional roles. This general research bias, combined with biases of our curation, has obvious impacts on the resulting network structure. Previous work by our group has documented the impact of bias towards well studied, multifunctional genes in other types of network analyses [43]. Our observation of the high internode connectivity in the curated network demonstrates the presence of DTRI biases beyond gene popularity. Likewise, it is unclear whether the skewed representation of DTRIs involving activation of proximal cREs is the result of research bias or a real biological pattern. As such, we caution against interpretations based on the properties of the manually curated network.

We curated what we estimate to be a substantial, but still small, fraction of the relevant literature. Fortunately, our curation protocol can be scaled up to produce a considerably larger collection of high confidence DTRIs. According to our estimates, our current curation has captured less than ten percent of all experimentally verified DTRIs reported in the published literature. The bulk of our curation was performed in four months by two full time curators. Given this experience, we estimate an exhaustive curation effort could be completed by a team of ten curators in approximately 12 months. Importantly, we predict that about a third of all reported DTRIs would be supported by all three types of experimental evidence. However, we take note of the scarcity of specific DTRIs in particular contexts. In particular, we found less than 5% of all recorded DTRIs to have reliably demonstrated activity specifically in the CNS. While we postulate that a manual curation approach is required to establish a high confidence DTRI catalogue for training and validating high-throughput predictions, the aforementioned biases and scarcity of low-throughput experiments will prevent the use of manually curated networks directly for analysis. To elucidate the architecture of gene regulation underpinning neurodevelopment and disease, it is imperative to develop effective means for accurately predicting DTRIs based on high-throughput data. This curation effort supports progress towards this end.

Methods

All data analyses and visualizations were performed using R and R-Studio [44]. Data plots were made using ggplot2 [45]. Networks visualizations were constructed using Cytoscape [46]. For data manipulation, we used Tidyverse [47].

Obtaining records from external resources

We obtained records from eight external databases: ENdb, TRRUST, CytReg, OReganno, HTRIdb, TFe, TFactS, and InnateDB. We downloaded the ENdb records from http://www.licpathway.net/ENdb/ on Sept. 14th, 2020. Records from the remaining databases were downloaded between Dec. 9 and Dec. 16, 2019. We obtained the CytReg records from the supplementary data of the original publication. For TRRUST, we downloaded both the human and mouse data tables directly from https://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/. An additional column was added to preserve the species annotation before joining the two tables. The most recent version of the records in ORegAnno were obtained from http://www.oreganno.org/. Here, we retained only records with valid Entrez or Ensembl ID, and PubMed ID annotations. In addition, records annotated as miRNA regulation or those resulting from high-throughput screens were excluded. We downloaded InnateDB records from https://www.innatedb.com/ and filtered for records reporting protein-DNA interactions. The TFe records were retrieved from the now deprecated web API, http://cisreg.cmmt.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/tfe. Species information was inferred from the TF gene symbols recorded in TFe. The TFactS records were downloaded from http://www.tfacts.org/. A union set was derived by merging both signed and signless data tables in TFactS. Finally, for HTRIdb, we downloaded the data from http://www.lbbc.ibb.unesp.br/htri. Here, we filtered for literature curated records with valid PubMed ID annotations.

From each database we retained records of one-to-one regulator-target interactions with annotations in either human or mouse. We indexed genes using Entrez IDs. In cases where only the gene symbols were available, we mapped the symbols to Entrez IDs, first by using the official HGNC or MGI symbols and then by gene aliases. With the exception of ENdb, which was published after we completed curation, the retrieved set of publications was used as a source of candidate papers for curation in the present study (S1 Data). Each publication was assigned to one or more TFs based on the recorded DTRIs. Additionally, we also retained species information and modes of regulation where available. For all analysis and reporting, we matched all TF and target genes to human orthologs using NCBI HomoloGene [48] (Mancarci and French, 2019: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/homologene/index.html). When there are no human orthologs, the mouse Entrez gene is used directly. Independent regulatory interactions were defined as unique combinations of the human TF and target genes.

Identification of neurodevelopmental TFs

We define TFs to be either the genes annotated with least one regulatory target in any of the previous resources or those identified as TFs by Lambert et al. (2018) [49]. Collectively, this TF set consists of 2,235 genes. Given our particular focus in this study on neurodevelopment, we further designated 438 TFs as neurodevelopmental TFs based Gene Ontology annotations, and disease association records from SFARI (S2 Data) [50,51]. We downloaded the list of genes annotated with the central nervous system development GO term (GO:0007417) or any of its descendent terms for both human and mouse from AmiGO (http://amigo.geneontology.org/). Next, we downloaded the list of genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders from the SFARI database (https://gene.sfari.org/). The list of TFs is provided in S2 Data. Finally, we manually prioritized these TFs for curation based on the annotated association with neurodevelopment and the number of candidate papers retrieved.

Obtaining candidate publications for curation

In addition to the candidate papers derived from the external resources, we also performed an independent PubMed query for each TF (refer to the previous section for the operational definition of a TF). We took advantage of the E-Utilities API provided by NCBI to perform searches programmatically [52]. We selected six MeSH terms that indicate experimental evidence for: "Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid”, "Transcription, Genetic”, “Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins”, “Gene Expression Regulation”, "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation”, and "Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay”. The set of the selected search terms were appended to the gene symbol of each TF to form an independent search query to obtain the corresponding set of candidate papers. To approximate gene popularity of TFs, we performed another round of PubMed query for each TF using only the gene symbol without the MeSH terms.

Experiment-centric curation of DTRIs

For each paper that we examined, we recorded all low-throughput experimental evidence of DTRIs. Specifically, we look for three types of experiments: TF perturbation, TF-DNA binding, and TF-reporter assays. As such, each experiment constitutes an independent record in the database and is assigned a unique identifier (S3 Data). Gene identifiers were translated into Entrez IDs at the time of recording. Species information was recorded separately for the TF and the target genes. The context type may be cell lines, or primary tissue or cells. In the case of EMSA experiments, the context types are designated to be in-vitro. In addition to the context type, we further annotated each experiment with a specific ontology term in order to retain the highest context resolution possible. We used terms from the UBERON ontology [53] for primary tissue, the CL ontology [54] for primary cells, and the CLO ontology [55] for cell lines. Where the appropriate ontology term could not be found in the aforementioned ontologies, we additionally used terms from the BTO [56] and the EFO [57] ontologies. When all else fails, we directly recorded the name provided in the original publication. Age was also recorded as a separate attribute for experiments that used primary tissues or cells. Where available, we also recorded the direction of regulation as well as whether the reported regulatory element is proximal or distal to the TSS of the target gene. Proximal elements were defined to be either promoters or cREs within 2 kb upstream or downstream of the TSS. Box 1 contains the full list of recorded attributes and the corresponding descriptions.

For each type of experiment, we selected a number of details. For TF perturbation experiments, we recorded whether the TF was overexpressed, down regulated, or knocked out. We also recorded whether the perturbation was dynamically induced before the time of assay or constitutively modified at the beginning of life. For TF-DNA binding experiments, we recorded both ChIP-assay and EMSA experiments. For EMSA, we further annotated the source of the TF protein. Finally, for reporter assays, we recorded whether mutations were introduced to the cRE sequence for comparison.

Network analysis

To assess the connectivity of the manually curated network, we used the iGraph package in R [58]. First, we constructed a directed network consisting of all curated DTRIs. Three metrics were computed to measure internode connectivity: the number of valid gene-to-gene paths, the number of cliques with three or more nodes, and the number of independent components. To assess statistical significance, we constructed 1000 network permutations by randomly swapping all edges while preserving both in and out degrees of all nodes. This set of random networks were then used to generate empirical null distributions for each of the three metrics. One-tailed p-values were computed by obtaining the fraction of random values larger or smaller than the observed values.

Comparison with high-throughput TF perturbation screens

We selected PAX6/Pax6, the TF with the highest number of recorded targets, as the primary TF for assessing correspondence with high-throughput screens. We obtained the genome wide expression data generated by Walcher et al. (2013) [36] along with its metadata from Gemma [59]. We then performed a differential expression analysis between the wild type and the Pax6-Sey samples using limma [60]. This resulted in a list of genes with p-values and FDR corrected q-values representing significance of differential expression upon Pax6 knockout. For hit list analyses, we used a cut-off FDR of 0.1. Processed differential expression analysis results generated by Narayanan et al. (2018) [37] were obtained directly from the supplementary materials of the original publication [37]. These two datasets were selected for their relevance to brain development. We used the ranking of nominal p-values for the AUROC. The Entrez IDs for the mouse genes were mapped to human orthologs using HomoloGene so that the results could be compared with the current curation.

Next, we took all curated targets for PAX6/Pax6 that were present in each dataset and sliced it according to cellular context and quality of evidence. To retrieve targets with demonstrated activity in the CNS, we retrieved all interactions for PAX6/Pax6 where there is at least one experiment annotated with the CNS ontology term (UBERON:0001017) or any of its descendent terms. Similarly, we searched for all targets annotated with the eye term (UBERON:0000970). Targets with evidence in both the CNS and the eye were placed only in the CNS category so that the categories are mutually exclusive. The remaining targets were classified as “other”. To subset by quality of evidence, we binned all PAX6/Pax6 targets into those with multiple types of experiments vs. only a single type of experiment.

Each of these target subsets were then tested for enrichment in the two high-throughput differential expression screens. Enrichment was tested in two ways. First, for Walcher et al., 2013 [36], a hit list of differentially expressed genes was generated using an FDR threshold. Overrepresentation of the curated targets in this list was tested by using the hypergeometric distribution, yielding a p-value for each set of curated targets. Next, we generated a ranking of differentially expressed genes in both datasets using nominal p-values and used the AUROC method to test enrichment for each set of curated targets towards the top of these rankings. AUROCs were computed by using the Mann-Whitney U Test. To test for significant differences among the AUROCs for the different target subsets, we estimated the variance of the AUROC for each subset by bootstrapping 1000 random samples for each set of curated targets. Significant differences were determined by assessing the overlaps among 95th percentile confidence intervals.

Beyond PAX6/Pax6, we additionally compared the curated targets for other TFs to high-throughput screens sourced from KnockTF. The complete KnockTF database was downloaded from http://www.licpathway.net/KnockTF/ on June 6, 2021. Initially, we included all the TFs with 10 or more curated targets in the current resource and at least three TF perturbation screens (S13 Data). Across the 10 TFs, we collectively obtained the processed differential expression analysis results for 53 datasets. Like the PAX6/Pax6 datasets, we used the rankings of nominal p-values to perform the AUROC enrichment analyses. To control for dataset specific conditions, we obtained the consensus ranking for each TF by averaging the rank of each gene across the datasets. Nonoverlapping genes were dropped. To compare across all DTRI resources, we additionally obtained the results of 123 TF perturbation datasets, for a total of 176 datasets and 37 TFs. Using the consensus rankings, AUROCs and corresponding p-values were then computed for all DTRI resource and TF combinations with at least 10 recorded targets.

Each point is a high-throughput data set. Stars denote enrichment in the consensus ranking across all datasets for each TF. TFs are ordered by decreasing AUROCs in the consensus ranking. For eight of the 10 TFs, the consensus rankings are more enriched for the curated targets than the median across all datasets. Colors indicate statistical significance. For four TFs, the consensus rankings are significantly enriched for the curated targets.

S22 Fig Comparison of enrichment levels among DTRI resources.

AUROC enrichment values were computed for each unique combination of DTRI resource and TF where there 10 or more targets using the consensus rankings (See Methods). The size of each data point corresponds to the number of TFs where the AUROC values were computed. The data points show average AUROCs, and the error bars show the 95th confidence intervals. A confidence interval could not be computed for ENdb as this resource only contains enough (>10) targets for a single TF.

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Authors:

Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: In this manuscript the authors describe the construction of a manually curated collection of TF-gene regulatory interactions, involving 251 TFs associated with nervous system development. Although being restricted to a small set of TFs of interest, this work provides a valuable resource for the community, containing important information such as type of experimental evidences of the TF-gene interactions and cellular context, adding to the novelty of the described database compared to the published resources. The analyses are generally well performed, the curation protocol is well described and all data and source code is made available. Overall, this study merits publication in PLOS Computational Biology. I have however some comments that I believe need to be addressed.

1) Authors validate their database using one example of a Pax6 perturbation study. To strengthen their approach, they should consider providing 1-2 more examples of other TFs for which there is available perturbation data.

2) To compare the performance of their approach with the available databases, the authors should provide Pax6 targets enrichment results using 1-2 other published resources they mention, e.g. TRRUST or CysReg.

3) Minor comment: Figures 2A and 4D – colours of the Venn diagrams are too dim, making the diagrams not visible.

Reviewer #2: The reviewer thanks the authors for the opportunity to gain insight in their interesting work and thanks the PLOS Computational Biology for the opportunity to act as reviewer.

The availability of high quality curated regulatory information annotated with evidence from low-throughput experiments and information regarding mode of regulation and biological context is of high importance for all aspects of life sciences that employ computational approaches involving comprehensive querying and modelling of digital standardised data, information and knowledge with the aim to seek improved understanding of complex biological systems to optimally support research and innovation for societal sectors, including health care, food, biotech industry and environment. Biocuration, as accomplished in the current work - the extraction of knowledge from unstructured biological data into a structured, computable form – is scientific work of high importance and impact. The large set of information regarding transcriptional regulatory interactions involving transcription factors with roles in neurodevelopment generated by the authors represents a highly valuable resource, in particular for the field of neurobiology. Specifically, the curated compendium of information is of commendable richness in experimental and biological context detail, all of which is systematically mapped to acknowledged ontologies and controlled vocabularies. Moreover, the paper includes analyses of the curated information allowing for prudent and informative discussion of research bias embodied in the scientific literature and challenges related to lack of completeness of information on transcriptional regulatory interactions in existing databases.

The authors hypothesize that information regarding direct transcriptional regulatory interactions (DTRIs) evidenced by low-throughput experiments as documented by curation of scientific literature, can produce a reliable set of DTRIs that is highly interpretable and more suitable for the evaluation of high-throughput predictions than other, similar resources . The group conducted a curation effort to generate a set of 1499 DTRIs focussing 251 transcription factors (TFs) considered to be involved in neurodevelopment, and for which evidence from low-throughput experiments could be found in the scientific literature. The hypothesis was then tested by comparing the DTRIs in the curated set with the content in existing resources and with transcriptional regulatory interactions obseved in a previousy published high-throughput Pax6 perturbation screen. Based on finding an enrichment of curated, experimentally evidenced Pax6 DTRIs among the transcriptional interactions detected in the high-throughput screen, the authors claim that the literature curated set of DTRIs represents a reliable knowledge resource with high sensitivity for DTRIs predicted from HTP screens and more suitable for the evaluation of high-throughput predictions than other, similar resources. Furthermore, the authors claim that their curated set af DTRIs is more interpretable than other similar resources.

The originality of the claims is modest, since it is widely accepted that information and knowledge manually curated from full text papers where it is normally supported by low-throughput experimental evidence has high value for the current life sciences. This has been widely discussed and documented, amongst others through the activites of the Gene Ontology Consortium and IMEX Consortium.

Specifically, the value of such information and knowledge in the field of transcriptional regulatory interactions, has been convincingly demonstrated by Garcia-Alonso L, et al, 2019 (PMID: 31340985). An in depth manual curation effort for transcriptional regulatory interactions within the subdomain of liver-enriched TFs by e.g. Thomas P, et al, 2015 (PMID: 25433699) similarly demonstrated such value.

The manuscript’s support for the claims that the curated set of DTRIs is highly reliable and is more interpretable and more suitable than other, similar resources for the evaluation of predictions from high-throughput experiments is on the weak side. This is related to the circumstance that set of DTRIs has only been tested against one HTP screen probing TF Pax6 transcriptional regulations and that the attribute ‘interpretability’ has not been rigorously defined and tested.

The reviewer suggests revision of the manuscript comprising, amongst other, more coherent articulation of and stronger support for the central claims to make a stronger case for publication as research paper in PLOS Computational Biology

Areas of improvement

1) The curated set of DTRIs should be tested against additonal HTP screens representing a wider repertoir of TFs, and ideally including more than one type of HTP analysis (for instance ChIP in addition to transcriptomics) to derive more robust support for the claim pertaining to suitability for evaluation of high-throughput predictions.

2) To support the claim pertaining to higher interpretability, it would be necessary for the authors to define what they mean by interpretability. This should be followed by testing against other, similar resources.

3) Of central focus of the presented work is the curation of «direct transcriptional regulatory interactions (DTRIs)». However, the authors do not specify what they mean by «direct». According to established conventions, the regulators involved in «direct» transcription regulation are regarded to be the DNA -binding transcription factors (dbTFs) whereas the transcription co-regulators are considered to be more indirectly involved via protein interactions with dbTFs. GO-terms GO:0003700 and GO:0003712 can be consulted for authoritative definitions of the dstinct molecular functions of dbTFs and co-TFs. The TFs in the curated DTRI set comprises regulators of both categories. Examples of proteins in the set that are considered to be co-TFs and not dbTFs are CTNNB1 and SPOP. The reviewer is aware that term «transcription factor» is often used for both dbTFs and co-TFs, also in several of the existing databases used and cited in the current work. Nevertheless, it is of high importance for use and interpretation of the valuable resource generated in the present work that it is explicitly stated what is meant by «direct», and to enable users of the data to adequately deal with dbTFs and co-TFs in the gene regulatory networks enabled by the resource.

4) Related to the issue discussed in 3), the authors should clarify the relevance and confidence of a direct regulatory interaction investigated by ChIP- and reporter experiments, compared to experiments like EMSA performed with purified TFs. The reviewer regards the latter as a clearly stronger evidence for direct protein-gene interaction than the former, even though some reporter gene experimental set ups, e.g. those utilizing gene regulatory regions specifically mutated in the TFBS, can also provide strong indication for direct interaction. The reviewer disagrees with the authors that «…reliability of EMSAs might be improved by using the endogenous TF protein…» in nuclear extracts (manuscript line 232-). It is commonly thought that it is not possible to ascertain the nature of the protein (complex) represented in an EMSA band shift produced from nuclear extracts, meaning that it is not known which protein species are involved, and which specific protein(s) directly bind the DNA.

5) The manuscript refers to the curation protocol developed for this work. However the reviewer was unable to find this protocol in the submitted material. The protocol should be made available in a form that would enable a better understanding of how the curated information was identified and mapped to the chosen ontologies and controlled vocabularies and to enable other curators to reproduce the developed methodology for similar curation efforts. It would be highly preferable that the protocol includes guidelines pertaining to which sections of the full paper (e.g. result section, figures, method sections) to be used for the different curation aspects and how the identified information should be used to generate the appropriate annotations.

6) The definition of proximal and distal elements applied in the current work is not in line with the most updated definition for proximal-distal TFBS provided by the highly authoritative Sequence Ontology (SO). For example, the SO defines a proximal TFBS (SO:0001668) to be located in the region from about -250 to -40 relative to +1 of RNA transcription start site. The authors should consider to apply the definitions laborated by SO, or at least comment on how they deviate from this definition.

7) The data of the paper are made available in large detail and depth in supplementary files. However, in order to maximally enable the re-use of this valuable information, the authors are strongly adviced to re-check how the presentation of the curated data complies with established standards for representing regulatory interactions with the aim to implement adjustments that could enhance interoperability with other resources. Such standards have been formulated and discussed by e.g. the Gene Ontology Consortium, 2021 (PMID: 33290552), Perfetto et al, 2019 (PMID: 30793173) and Touré et al, 2021 (PMID: 33547799). The PSICQUIC exchange format developed by the EBI is well suited for dissemination of regulatory interaction information and could be considered for use by the authors in order to optimally support re-use and comply with FAIR principles.

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Authors:

Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: The authors have addressed all of my comments very thoroughly and I would like to acknowledge them for their efforts. The main value of the work in the availability of experimental and contextual details of the curation is now clearly highlighted in the text and newly added validations and comparisons further strengthened the manuscript.

Reviewer #2: To the editor,

The reviewer thanks the journal for the opportunity to comment on the revised manuscript and thanks the authors for their constructive responses to the comments from reviewers

There are a few aspects where the manuscript would benefit from clarifications in the text. These are mentioned below in the order of their appearance in the text

*line 343*

It would be good if you refer to ENCODE nomenclature as basis for your definition of proximal (since there are a number of different definitions currently in use)

*line 366 and other similar parts of text*

In your letter to the editor on the revised manuscript you state that the comparison with the high throughput Pax6 perturbation was «intended to be a demonstration of a potential use case of our resource» (page 2).

In the manuscript your statements regarding the motivation and outcome of comparing the DTRI resource with observations in high-throughput screens are somewhat heterogenous and span statements pertaining to assessment of high-throughput screen results («...benchmark high-throughput screens» (line 366), «...high confidence DTRI catalogue for training and validating high-throughput predictions» (line 542)) but also pertaining to qualities related to your DTRI resource (e.g. «...suggest that our tissue annotations are accurate» (line 412))

It would be good if you could take another look to see whether clarity and stringency can be improved regarding motivations for comparison and premisses for statements regarding the outcome of the comparisons.

*line 418*

I suggest to provide a few words specifying biological context regarding the «alternative Pax6 pertubation dataset»

*line 424*

Is it 53 or 52 experiments? (Methods section states 52)

*line 424/line 689*

It should be stated whether «all the TFs with more than 10 curated targets» (line 689 Methods section) were taken from only the current DTRI resource, or from the compiled resource including all external resources. If it is the former (only current), this selection strategy is likely to create a bias in comparison with other DTRI resources because the set of TFs with at least 10 targets is likely to vary between resources.

*line 424/line 689*

It would be helpful for the reader if some details were given in the Result- or Methods section regarding the biological context of the 52/53 TF perturbation sets (cell line, in vivo, organ/tissue type, type of perturbation)
