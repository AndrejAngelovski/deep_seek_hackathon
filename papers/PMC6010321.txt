equilibrium adjustments responsible for homeostatic stability in brain
structures that modulate behavior and emotions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) from the serotonin 2C receptor gene (HTR2C) have been
associated with several neurological and mental disorders, including
abnormalities in cognitive and emotional processes. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the association between the rs6318 SNP of the HTR2C
gene and behavioral characteristics exhibited by children and adolescents based
on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) inventory. Eighty-five psychiatric
outpatients between 8 and 18 years of age underwent genotyping of the rs6318
SNP. The CBCL/6-18 scale was administered to their caregivers. The chi-squared
test was used to assess differences in the frequency of C and G alleles of the
rs6318 SNP relative to the grouped CBCL/6-18 scores; significance level was 5%.
The presence of the G allele of rs6318 was found to be associated with
characteristics of aggressive behavior and social problems, and aggressive
behavior was found to be associated with heterozygosis in females. These
findings contribute to the identification of mental and behavioral phenotypes
associated with gene expression.

Introduction
Mental health issues among children and adolescents are relevant because they are
common, usually persist into adulthood, and impact other individuals and society at
large (1). In Brazil, the overall prevalence
of one or more psychiatric disorder among school-age children and adolescents is
approximately 13.1%, a rate similar to averages found worldwide (2).

Highly effective instruments can predict symptom patterns in children and
adolescents. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) is a parental rating inventory
based on the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-IV) (3), and it is widely used
in scientific studies (4,5). Bordin et al. (6,7) have translated and
validated the CBCL/6-18 inventory for the Brazilian population.

Empirical studies report that psychopathological traits are strongly associated with
genetics as early as childhood, and there have been attempts to identify possible
determinants on the molecular level, at which specific polymorphisms and alleles may
be associated (8,9). A variation at a single position in the DNA sequence is
defined as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) if more than 1% of a population
carries that variation. The alteration can lead to variations in the amino acid
sequence (10,11). Some SNPs have been described as being associated with psychiatric
disorders (12).

The serotonin 2C receptor gene (HTR2C), located at Xq23 (13), encodes for the serotonin 2C receptor
(5HT-2C). This receptor is involved in moment-to-moment homeostatic regulation of
the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neurophysiological processes, and it has been
found to aid in homeostatic stability and the prevention of allostatic overload
(14). Homeostasis is understood as the
interactions between automatic and constant physiological processes that promote
health and well-being. In contrast, allostatic regulations shift these operating
ranges when the body encounters new challenges, rewards or threats that require an
active coping response (15,16). Autoradiographic studies have identified
5HT-2C in the choroid plexus, cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus,
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala (17).

There are 911 known SNPs within the HTR2C gene, and 390 have been
validated. These 390 SNPs are good candidates for association studies (14). The rs6318 (C/G) SNP, in particular, is a
frequent mutation in nucleotide 68 associated with a cysteine (G allele) to serine
(C allele) substitution (forward direction) at amino acid 23 of the protein
sequence. This substitution could disrupt a disulfide bridge (14).

The objective of this study was to determine possible associations between the rs6318
(C/G) SNP and behavioral symptoms among children and adolescents receiving
outpatient psychiatric care.

Material and Methods
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. The subjects were children and
adolescents who had participated in a previous study that quantified the incidence
of obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and
hyperprolactinemia in children and adolescents to whom risperidone was administered
to treat mental and behavioral disorders (18
–20). The
inclusion criteria allowed for children and adolescents between the ages of 8 and 18
who were treated in the outpatient psychiatric unit of the Universidade Estadual de
Campinas (UNICAMP) Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo, Brazil between March 2014 and
August 2015. This clinic is designed for severe mental health cases requiring
tertiary care. This public hospital receives referrals from more than 100 cities in
the state of São Paulo (21). The exclusion
criteria were prior obesity, the use of medication known to cause metabolic
syndrome, physical illness that could alter metabolic parameters, regular use of
psychoactive drugs, moderate or severe intellectual disability, and diagnosis of an
eating disorder.

All of the subjects from the previous study were invited to participate in the
current study. Patients and their guardians provided informed consent before
entering the second study (UNICAMP Research Ethics Committee Form 44199; Certificate
of Presentation for Ethical Consideration [CAAE] Registry No. 04369612.8.0000.5404;
June 26, 2012).

The psychiatric diagnoses of the patients were based on the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (22), and
this information was obtained from their medical records. Forty-two subjects (49.4%)
had conduct disorders (F91) or mixed disorders of conduct and emotions (F92); 35
(41.2%) had hyperkinetic disorders (F90); 29 (34.1%) had depressive disorders (F32,
F33, F34, F38, and F39); 24 (28.2%) had mild mental retardation (F70); 20 (23.5%)
had pervasive developmental disorders (F84); 17 (20%) had neurotic, stress-related,
or somatoform disorders; and 6 (7.1%) had schizophrenia (F20) or schizotypal
disorders (F21). Information on the use of psychiatric drugs was also obtained from
their medical records. All of the patients were undergoing treatment with
risperidone, which had been given for a mean of 34.6±23.5 months at the time of data
collection. Nineteen patients (22.7%) were receiving the medication as monotherapy,
48 (54.1%) were also receiving antidepressants, 23 (27.1%) were receiving
risperidone associated with a psychostimulant, and 11 (12.9%) were receiving
risperidone associated with clonidine. Fifteen patients (17.6%) were receiving other
associated drugs, which included anticonvulsants, lithium, benzodiazepines, and
other antipsychotic drugs.

The CBCL/6-18 scale was administered to the patients' parents or guardians. This
instrument tracks behavioral changes in children and adolescents over the six months
prior to its administration. It was applied after each patient's scheduled
psychiatric appointment.

The inventory is composed of 138 questions answered on a Likert scale, 20 of which
refer to a competence scale score and 118 address behavioral problems (7). Respondents must assign one of the
following scores to the problems addressed in each question: 0 if it is not true; 1
if it is somewhat or sometimes true, or 2 if it is very true or often true. For the
calculation of the final score, the Assessment Data Manager (ADM) software (ASEBA¯
Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, USA) was used. The software
provides T-scores, a chart analysis, and a report.

The competence scale score is calculated as the sum of the raw scores of the
activities, social, and school subscales. The behavioral problems are separated into
three groups: syndrome scales (anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, somatic
complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking
behavior, and aggressive behavior); broadband scales (internalizing problems,
externalizing problems, and total problems, the latter of which is the sum of the
scores for the internalizing problems and the externalizing problems); other
problems (which include eating disorders, sleep disorders, sphincter control,
physical problems, and sluggish cognitive time); and DSM-IV-oriented scales (anxiety
problems, somatic problems, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, opposition and
challenging problems, and conduct problems).

The weighted results of the CBCL/6-18 allow for the classification of children and
adolescents into normal, borderline, or clinical ranges. On the social scales, the
scores are considered clinical when they are under 30, borderline when they are
between 30 and 33, and normal when they are over 33. On the behavior scales, the
scores are considered clinical when they are over 70, borderline when they are
between 67 and 70, and normal when they are under 67. When the total score is
calculated, clinical scores are defined as those over 63, while borderline scores
are those between 60 and 63, and normal scores are those under 60.

The genomic DNA samples were obtained from 8 mL of total peripheral blood collected
in tubes with EDTA (0.6 M), pH 8.0, as anticoagulant. Genomic DNA was purified from
peripheral leukocytes according to standard protocols by lysing with proteinase K
(Boehringer Mannhein, Germany), extracting with phenol/chloroform, and precipitating
with ethanol (23
). To determine genotypes for the rs6318 (C/G) SNP
in the HTR2C gene, real-time PCR using TaqMan¯ allelic discrimination assay (Applied
Biosystems, USA) and primers available from SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied
Biosystems) were used. The total volume for all reactions was 7 µL containing TaqMan
Genotyping PCR Master Mix 2X (3.5 µL), SNP Genotyping Assay 40X (0.175 µL), MiliQ
water (2.325 µL), and 10 ng of each genomic DNA (1 µL). Reactions were performed in
96-well optical plates (0.1 ml MicroAmp, Applied Biosystems) and submitted to the
following temperatures and cycles: a first cycle of 10 min denaturation at 95°C
followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min extension at 60°C. Amplification
reactions were performed in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Validation studies demonstrate that the Applied Biosystems 7500 System SDS is a
robust, reliable, and reproducible system for performing DNA quantification (24). Data were recorded and analyzed using 7500
System Sequence Detection Software© (SDS, Life Technologies
Corporation©, USA). All procedures were conducted at the Human
Genetics Laboratory of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering
of UNICAMP.

The minor allele frequency (MAF) was calculated by adding the total number of alleles
and then determining the rate of the least frequent allele among the homozygotes,
hemizygotes, and heterozygotes. The result was compared to the 1000 Genomes Project
database (11).

Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS, version 22 (IBM, USA). The weighted CBCL
results were arranged into two distinct groups with two categories each. The first
group included individuals with no abnormalities (“normal”) versus those with any
abnormalities (“borderline clinical range” plus “clinical range”). The second group
was based on another paradigm: individuals with no or few abnormalities (“normal”
plus “borderline clinical range”) versus individuals with more abnormalities
(“clinical range”).

The chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were applied to evaluate possible
differences in the frequencies of C and G alleles from the rs6318 SNP relative to
each subscale of each weighted grouped score, as described above, on the CBCL/6-18.
The significance level adopted was 5%.

Results
The study comprised 85 patients, 65 (76.5%) of whom were male. The mean age was
13.4±2.7 years (range 8 to 18 years old). Most of the caregivers who completed the
CBCL/6-18 scale were women (84.7%), 50 (58.7%) of whom were the patients' biological
mothers. Other respondents included fathers, grandparents, shelter caregivers,
stepmothers, stepfathers, aunts, uncles, and older brothers or sisters.

There was no significant association for any of the other tested CBCL grouped scores
(P>0.05) with the genotype of the rs6318 SNP of the HTR2C
gene.

Discussion
The current study investigated the possible associations between the rs6318 SNP of
the HTR2C gene and the categories addressed on the CBCL/6-18 scale.
The results suggest that associations between the SNPs studied and symptoms
suggestive of externalizing disorders are frequent. Treatment with antipsychotics is
a therapeutic option for these symptoms, which include difficulty controlling
aggressive behavior, antisocial behavior, and impulse control (25
–27).

Other associations between behavioral changes and the rs6318 SNP have been described
in the literature. According to Okada et al. (28), the C allele is much more active than the G allele. Brummett et al.
(29) found the same baseline cortisol
levels in subjects with either C or G alleles. However, when exposed to
emotion-inducing stimuli, such as stress, anger, and sadness, subjects with the G
allele had significantly lower cortisol activation (P<0.001), less anger
(P=0.08), and a less depressive mood (P=0.006). The SNPs were also found to be
associated with norepinephrine turnover, which was most highly correlated with the
rs6318 SNP (30

–33
). The altered expression of the
HTR2C gene may therefore be associated with increased operation
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and with greater amygdala reactivity
(34,14).

When the rs6318 SNP was evaluated, aggressive behavior was found to be associated
with the presence of the G allele (P=0.029) across the sample. When the sample was
separated by sex, the association of aggressive behavior remained among hemizygote
males with the G allele (P=0.022). In psychiatry, aggressive behavior is described
as being strongly associated with social problems (14). Our findings corroborate this information, as associations between
social problems and the presence of G allele were found both in females alone
(P=0.045) and with both sexes considered together (P=0.019).

Other studies have reported the expected association between the rs6318 SNP and
depressive or anxiety symptoms, but it was not found in this study (35


–39
). A possible explanation could be a question of
selection bias, as all of the study subjects were taking antipsychotic drugs due to
their diagnoses involving severe externalizing behaviors. This fact may have led to
the undervaluation of depressive and anxiety symptoms among the participants. It was
noted, however, that though these individuals were brought to psychiatric
consultations mainly because of externalizing problems, the co-occurrence of the
CBCL/6-18 depressive syndrome and anxious syndrome categories were positive in 28
(32.9%) and in 26 (30.6%) individuals, respectively.

The fact that subjects were taking psychiatric drugs at the time of the CBCL/6-18
application was a limiting factor. Because the scale considers only the six months
prior to its administration, the medication may have influenced behavioral symptoms
and decreased parents' perceptions. Nevertheless, the results were statistically
significant, suggesting that the symptoms were so intense that they were observable
even when the children and adolescents were receiving pharmacological treatment.

According to the 1000 Genomes Project (11),
the MAF is 17% for the 6318 SNP in the overall population. In the current study, the
MAF was 26.2% for rs6318 SNP. According to the data available, however, this
frequency varies widely between ethnic groups.

Racial mixing in Brazil is something that must always be taken into account in any
genetic study involving the population as a whole. Brazil's multiracial population
is the result of contact between native indigenous peoples, European settlers,
enslaved Africans, and, more recently, immigrants from the period between the two
world wars, which included people from Italy and Japan, among other ethnicities
(40).

The associations found between the rs6318 single nucleotide polymorphism on the
HTR2C gene and behavioral symptoms, especially aggressive
behavior problems, aid in the identification of phenotypes associated with gene
expression. However, longitudinal studies are needed to examine the possible causal
relationship between polymorphisms and transient or durable psychiatric symptoms
over the course of childhood and adolescent development. Epigenetics should also be
considered in future studies. These characteristics and a genetic predisposition to
mental illness should be considered when determining the best therapeutic approach
for a given patient.
