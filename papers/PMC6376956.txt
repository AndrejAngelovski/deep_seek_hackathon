therapies for anxiety and depression. Yet, there is little empirical evidence of
its prevalence or specificity. Across three studies, we conducted a text
analysis of 63 Internet forums (over 6,400 members) using the Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count software to examine absolutism at the linguistic level. We
predicted and found that anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation forums
contained more absolutist words than control forums (ds >
3.14). Suicidal ideation forums also contained more absolutist words than
anxiety and depression forums (ds > 1.71). We show that
these differences are more reflective of absolutist thinking than psychological
distress. It is interesting that absolutist words tracked the severity of
affective disorder forums more faithfully than negative emotion words. Finally,
we found elevated levels of absolutist words in depression recovery forums. This
suggests that absolutist thinking may be a vulnerability factor.

==== Body
Absolutist thinking underlies many of the cognitive distortions (Beck, 1979; Burns, 1989) and irrational beliefs (A. Ellis & Harper, 1975)
that are purported to mediate the core affective disorders. Words, phrases, and ideas
that denote totality, either of magnitude or probability, are often referred to as
“absolute.” Absolutist thoughts are independent of context and unqualified by nuance. In
this observational study, we aimed to measure absolutist thinking in a specific and
ecologically valid manner. We then compared its relative association between a variety
of affective and nonaffective groups.

Absolutist thinking has strong empirical links to three distinct mental health groups:
suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and eating disorder (ED).
Regarding suicidal ideation, structured response formats have shown more extreme value
judgments by suicidal patients than controls (e.g., Neuringer, 1961, 1964). Thematic analysis by independent raters
also deemed the stories and poetry of suicidal individuals as highly “polarized” (Litinsky & Haslam, 1998;
Wedding, 2000). In
addition, dichotomous thinking, cognitive rigidity, and problem-solving deficits have
been repeatedly found to co-occur in suicidal individuals (for review, see T. E. Ellis & Rutherford,
2008). This is supported by a series of empirical studies from Pollock and Williams (1998,
2001, 2004; J. M. G. Williams & Pollock, 2008).

BPD patients also make more extreme responses on structured response formats than
controls (e.g., Moritz et al.,
2011; Napolitano &
McKay, 2007; Sieswerda,
Barnow, Verheul, & Arntz, 2013; Veen & Arntz, 2000). Some scholars have
used “spontaneous reactions” or short interviews to identify extreme or dichotomous
thinking styles (e.g., Arntz &
ten Haaf, 2012; Arntz
& Veen, 2001).

With respect to ED, the Dichotomous Thinking in Eating Disorders Scale (Byrne, Allen, Dove, Watt, &
Nathan, 2008) is widely used in ED studies (e.g., Antoniou, Bongers, & Jansen, 2017; Palascha, van Kleef, & van Trijp,
2015). Although obesity and anorexia are often studied separately, they both
link to absolutist thinking. For obesity, several reviews have found that avoiding
absolutist dichotomous thinking improves weight loss maintenance (e.g., Ohsiek & Williams, 2011).
Absolutism often takes the form of perfectionism in anorexia, as identified through
clinical observations (e.g., Fairburn, Cooper, & Shafran, 2003; Garner, Garfinkel, & Bemis, 1982),
structured response formats (e.g., Feixas i Viaplana, Montebruno, Dada, Castillo, & Compañ, 2010; Zotter & Crowther, 1991),
and interviews (e.g., Johnson &
Holloway, 1988).

Despite the inclusion of absolutist thinking into many cognitive therapy models for
anxiety and depression (Beck,
1979; Burns, 1989;
C. Williams & Garland,
2002), this association remains mostly neglected in the empirical literature
(A. Ellis, 1987). In a
notable exception, Teasdale et al.
(2001) found that an “absolutist, dichotomous thinking style” predicted
future depressive relapse, over and above the content of responses. This was evidenced
by both positive and negative “extreme responses” on Likert-type scales.

Attempts to investigate absolutist thinking have mostly employed some type of structured
response format. Ertel (1985)
was the first to use quantitative text analysis to measure dogmatism with the manual
Dogmatism Text Analysis Tool. More recently, with the advent of automated text analysis,
Cohen (2012) measured
“cognitive rigidity” in the “spontaneous autobiographical narratives” of undergraduate
students and found correlations with negative emotionality. Unlike structured response
formats, these natural language text analysis studies have more ecological validity.

With the growth of social media, Internet forums are increasingly being used as a source
of naturalistic writing for research in depression and other affective disorders (e.g.,
Fekete, 2002; Griffiths, Calear, & Banfield,
2009; Houston, Cooper,
& Ford, 2014). It is believed that insights into the cognitive processes
associated with particular affective disorders can be gleaned from how people with those
disorders write about their experiences. In three connected studies, we investigated the
frequency of absolutist words contained in different affective and nonaffective Internet
forum groups (Table 1; for
more details, see Table
S1 in the Supplemental Material available online). In the first study we
compared anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation (test) groups with general, asthma,
diabetes, and cancer (control) groups. We had two specific hypotheses:

Table 1. Characteristics of Test and Control Internet Forums

a General forums = Mumsnet (Women), Ladies Lounge (Women), Gentlemen’s Club
(Men), Ask Men (Men), Pensioners Forum (Elderly), Student Room (Young), Work
Problems. bNumber of Internet forums in each group.
cNumber of members who contributed to that group’s corpus.

Hypothesis 1 (H1): The percentage of
absolutist words in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation test forum groups
will be significantly greater than in Study 1 control forum groups.

Hypothesis 2 (H2): The percentage of
absolutist words in the suicidal ideation forum group will be significantly
greater than in both anxiety and depression forum groups.

Our second hypothesis is partly based on the strong association between suicidal ideation
and absolutist thinking (for review, see Arffa, 1983). But also, as suicidal ideation is
the more severe mental health concern, it could be hypothesized that absolutist thinking
will be correspondingly more extreme.

In Study 2, our aim was to show that absolutist words reflect absolutist thinking, rather
than psychological distress. We attempted to control for psychological distress by
comparing groups believed to have similar levels of negative emotions but different
levels of absolutist thinking (Table 1 and Table
S1). We compared mental health groups strongly associated with absolutist
thinking (BPD and ED, cited above) with mental health groups less associated with
absolutist thinking (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and schizophrenia). Although
we recognize that PTSD and schizophrenia may also have some links to absolutist
thinking, the literature suggests these links are likely to be much weaker than those of
BPD and ED. Relatively few researchers have examined absolutist thinking in PTSD and
schizophrenia, and these have often been limited or produced mixed results (e.g., Colbert, Peters, & Garety,
2010; Joseph & Gray,
2011). Conversely, there is a widespread consensus, based on a multitude of
studies, that BPD and ED are firmly linked to absolutist thinking (e.g., Alberts, Thewissen, & Raes,
2012; Napolitano &
McKay, 2007; Veen &
Arntz, 2000). We also measured the frequency of negative emotion terms to
further support the assumption that the four mental health groups had comparable levels
of negative emotions.

Hypothesis 3 (H3): The percentage of
absolutist words in BPD and ED test forum groups will be significantly greater
than in PTSD and schizophrenia control forum groups.

In Study 3, we aimed to determine the extent to which absolutist thinking could be a
cognitive vulnerability factor for depression and suicidal ideation. In a subset of
depression and suicidal ideation forums, there are “recovery” subforums (Table 1 and Table
S1). These subforums are visited by members who feel they are currently
out of depression. They often write very positive posts about their progress and words
of encouragement to other members. Theoretically, a cognitive vulnerability factor
should not only be present during an episode of depression but also persist during
recovery. Therefore,

Hypothesis 4 (H4): The percentage of
absolutist words in the recovery forum group will be significantly greater than
in Study 1 control forum groups.

Previous text analysis research has examined many different dictionary “dimensions.” When
analyzing written samples from anxious, depressed, or suicidal individuals, an increased
use of personal pronouns and negative emotion words has commonly been found (Bucci & Freedman, 1981;
Fekete, 2002; Lorenz & Cobb, 1952; Rude, Gortner, & Pennebaker,
2004; Stirman &
Pennebaker, 2001; Weintraub, 1981). In particular, pronouns have been identified as having a
stronger relationship with affective disorder than negative emotions (Pennebaker & Chung, 2013).
Like pronouns, absolutist words are functional; they help determine our style of
writing, not its contents. Moreover, functional words are ordinarily outside of
conscious control (Pennebaker &
Chung, 2013); therefore, they can serve as implicit markers. We believe a
shift in focus to how we think rather than what we think can provide greater insight
into possible cognitive mechanisms underlying affective disorders.

From the outset, we identified and validated a single dictionary of interest, as this
study was motivated by specific a priori hypotheses. This is in contrast to previous
text analysis studies that have used a subset of already constructed dictionaries or
identified features of interest based on the data itself (e.g., using an iterative
process with cross-validation and feature reduction; Mladenić, 2005). The large data set in this
study, from 12 different groups, representing 63 different Internet forums and more than
6,400 members, afforded a degree of ecological validity not achievable in experimental
studies. However, as with many observational studies, these benefits come with inherent
costs. We had limited information about the members posting in the forums, and for the
most part, their true identities and motivations were unknowable. Recognizing this
limitation, we hope that follow-up studies, using alternative experimental designs, will
extend the findings presented here.

Method
Forum selection
We used English-language Internet forums as a source of naturalistic writing for
our test and control categories. For all three studies, representative websites
were located through a Google search (search words: e.g., “suicide forums,”
“asthma forums”). Forums were selected for inclusion into the study on the basis
of Google rank (Table
1 and Table S1), were popular (thus yielding sufficient data for
analysis), and were actively moderated with clearly written moderation policies.
Each group in the test and control categories was composed of between four to
seven separate forums, as determined by forum availability. For Study 1, control
groups were carefully selected to provide the broadest level of control. The
“general” group provides a gender control with two forums for female members
(Mumsnet and Ladies Lounge) and two for male members (Askmen and Gentlemen’s
Club). The general group also controls for age, with a designated forum for
young members (Student Room) and older members (Pensioners Forum). The asthma
and diabetes groups control for chronic physical illness, and the cancer group
controls for severe physical and psychological distress. Study 3 recovery forums
were located within Study 1 depression and suicidal ideation test forums.

Data collection
Forum members can either introduce a new topic (“first posts”) or contribute to
an ongoing discussion (“replies”). In the interest of simplicity and
interpretability, only first posts were collected. Posts were copied and pasted
into a text document ready for subsequent text analysis. Where an individual
member contributes multiple posts, these were combined into a single text
document. All text files used in this study are hosted on Figshare
(doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.4743715). If a forum was further divided into
subforums, only the single most appropriate subforum was used (Table S1). For each test and control forum, we aimed to collect
30,000 words. Seven out of the 63 forums were not large enough to provide a
30,000-word corpus but were nevertheless retained in the study as they surpassed
10,000 words. Posts were only collected if they met our selection criteria: (a)
contain a minimum of 100 words, (b) be authored by a representative member of
that online community (i.e., not written on behalf of someone else/news article
etc.), and (c) be written in continuous prose (i.e., not lists, poems). Posts
from all test and control forums which met the selection criteria were collected
sequentially as presented by the respective forum website (usually by date
order). Posts were collected between April and May 2015 and December and January
2016. All data in this study was collected from the public domain; therefore,
although ethical consideration is still important, informed consent is not
required. This complies with the University of Reading research ethics
guidelines and the ethical guidance for internet-mediated research set out by
The British Psychological Society (British Psychological Association,
2013). The aggregate data used in this study are hosted on Figshare
(doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.4743547.v1).

Word count text analysis
Word counting text analysis was conducted using validated dictionaries that
characterize a particular linguistic dimension (i.e., negative words, auxiliary
verbs, family related words). For this study, we validated an absolutist and a
nonabsolutist words dictionary using independent expert judges.

Absolutist and nonabsolutist words indicate magnitudes or probabilities; absolute
words do so without nuance (i.e., always, totally, entire), whereas nonabsolute
words indicate some degree of nuance (i.e., rather, somewhat, likely). Both
dictionaries are composed of functional words devoid of valence, mostly
adverbial intensifiers or modal verbs. A subclass of nonabsolutist words, which
we have termed “extreme words,” indicate extreme (but not absolute) magnitudes
or probabilities (i.e., “very”). Although the terms extreme and
absolute have previously been used interchangeably (e.g.,
Teasdale et al.,
2001), we treat them here as qualitatively distinct.

To construct these dictionaries, we initially brainstormed more than 300
absolutist words and 200 nonabsolutist words (including extreme words). Testing
on pilot data (control and test groups) revealed that many of the words on these
original lists were too obscure to register with sufficient frequency for
analysis. Consequently, the original dictionaries were reduced to the most
prevalent 22 absolutist words and 43 nonabsolutist words (including 21 extreme
words). Although this was based on a mostly arbitrary cutoff, it was intended
that the lists be large enough to produce representative dictionary percentages,
but small enough to facilitate independent validation by experts. The 22
absolutist words and 43 nonabsolutist words were combined into a single list of
65 words. Five independent expert judges were asked to categorize them as
absolute, nonabsolute, and/or extreme. Two of the judges are clinical
psychologists from the University of Reading Charlie Waller Institute and three
are linguists from the University of Reading School of Clinical Language
Sciences. Judges were permitted to place words into more than one category
(i.e., extreme and absolute). The agreement between our original categorization
of the words (absolutist/nonabsolutist) and that of the judges ranged between
83% and 94%, whereas the interjudge agreement was 96%. Words were considered
absolute, extreme, or nonabsolute on the basis of a majority decision by the
judges. Three words, anything, need, and
needed, were moved from the absolutist dictionary to the
nonabsolutist dictionary as they were not categorized as absolute by the
majority of judges. All the words on our nonabsolutist dictionary were judged
nonabsolute. Judges showed almost no agreement on extreme words, this category
was consequently removed from the analysis (collapsed into the nonabsolutist
category).

The resulting 19-word absolutist dictionary is shown in Table S2 in the Supplemental Material. Both dictionaries were
used in the text analysis of test and control groups. We also ran dictionaries
contained within the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC; Pennebaker, Booth, Boyd, &
Francis, 2015). This program provides 73 validated dictionaries
covering a wide range of “dimensions” (i.e., questioning words, affective
processes, auxiliary verbs). All dictionaries, other than the absolutist
dictionary, were run purely for the benefit of comparison.

The LIWC text analysis software was used to test our absolutist and nonabsolutist
dictionaries as well as the LIWC dictionaries. It calculates the prevalence of a
given dictionary as a percentage of the total number of words analyzed.
Throughout, we have referred to this percentage measure of a dictionary’s
prevalence as its “index.” In each forum, we calculated an index for 75
dictionaries (1 absolute, 1 nonabsolute, and 73 LIWC).

For the absolutist index we have endeavored to account for false positives. There
are three principal types of false positives: a negation before the absolutist
word (i.e., “not completely”), a qualifier before the absolutist word (i.e.,
“almost completely”), and a salutation (i.e., “hello everyone”). These would
ordinarily register on our absolutist index and distort our measure of
absolutism. Fortunately, the LIWC (2015 version) can also count phrases, so we
ran a second version of our absolutist dictionary composed of the most common
false positives (as described). The absolutist false positive index was
subtracted from the absolutist index to provide a better estimate of absolutism.
We nevertheless rely on the assumption that any remaining false positives are
equally distributed between groups.

Results
Study 1
Data analysis
The control and test category forums were subdivided into groups as shown in
Table 1. To
analyze the data, a multilevel mixed-effects modeling approach was adopted
(the SPSS syntax script can be found in the Supplemental Material). This is
the recommended analysis method for this type of data structure (Baayen, Davidson, &
Bates, 2008). Members were nested within forums, and forums were
nested within groups (i.e., depression). Mixed-effects models consider both
fixed and random effects and can be used to assess the influence of the
fixed effects on the dependent variables after accounting for some outside
random effects. Residuals were weighted by the word count of each text file
and all the analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS software (version 21). To
correct for positive skew in the data, we used a log10(x + 1)
transformation, adding 1 to deal with 0 values (cf. Yamamura, 1999). We report raw
values for descriptive statistics to facilitate a more intuitive
understanding. The bootstrap procedure was also used to produce better
estimates of p values and confidence intervals (CIs). This
method is often recommended because it does not assume normally distributed
data (Cumming,
2014). Bootstrapped CIs (95%; bias-corrected and accelerated)
were computed through 1,000 random resamples (with replacement) using the
stratified sampling method, with forums as the strata variable.

Control group
There was no significant omnibus effect among the control groups as
determined by a multilevel mixed effects model, F(7, 11) =
0.754, p = .635 (Table 1 and Table S1). Consequently, they were combined into a single
“control group.” It is important that this suggests that the absolutist
index is largely independent of content, as it demonstrates remarkably
little variance across a wide range of very different discussion topics.

Multilevel mixed-effects model for the absolutist index
There was a large, significant difference in the absolutist index between the
Study 1 groups, as determined by a multilevel mixed-effects model,
F(3, 29) = 71.549, p < .001. Using
paired comparisons in the mixed-effects model, we compared the control group
with each of the Study 1 test groups to assess our first hypothesis. We also
compared the suicidal ideation forum group with the remaining two test
groups (anxiety and depression forums) to assess our second hypothesis. The
mean absolutist index for the control forum group (M =
0.97%, SD = 0.85) was significantly lower than anxiety
(M = 1.45%, SD = 0.97,
p < .001, d = 3.24, 95% CI = [0.07,
0.11]), depression (M = 1.45%, SD = 1.0,
p < .001, d = 3.14, 95% CI = [0.08,
0.11]), and suicidal ideation (M = 1.80%,
SD = 1.04, p < .001,
d = 4.56, 95% CI = [0.14, 0.18]) test forum groups.
Moreover, the suicidal ideation group was significantly greater than both
the anxiety (p < .001, d = 1.74, 95% CI
= [−0.09, −0.05]) and depression (p < .001,
d = 1.71, 95% CI = [−0.09, −0.05]) groups (Fig. 1a). These
results are consistent with both of our Study 1 hypotheses. Post hoc
comparisons with a Bonferroni correction revealed that there was no
significant difference between anxiety and depression forum group means
(p = 1.00).

absolutist words in Study 2 groups, and (c) negative emotion words
for Study 2 groups. Error bars indicate 95% bootstrapped confidence
intervals. PTSD = posttraumatic stress disorder; ED = eating
disorder; BPD = borderline personality disorder.

Multilevel mixed-effects model for the comparison dictionaries
Using the LIWC software, we produced indices for our nonabsolutist dictionary
and all 73 LIWC dictionaries. We were interested in determining which
comparison dictionary index would produce comparable significance levels and
effect sizes to that of our absolutist index. We again conducted a
multilevel mixed-effects model and pairwise comparisons for each of the 74
comparison dictionary indices. Table 2 displays the test
statistics and effect sizes for the 16 dictionaries with the largest
effects. Notably, our absolutist index has satisfied the study hypotheses
better than any of the linguistic dimensions previously linked to affective
disorder (negative emotions, personal pronouns etc.). Although “negative
emotion” words were predictably more prevalent in test group forums than
control forums, they paradoxically were less prevalent in suicidal ideation
forums than anxiety or depression forums. This was also the case for other
content dictionaries like “sad,” affect,” and “feel.”

effect size. Neg. emo = negative emotions; I = first-person
singular pronouns (e.g., I, me, my).

* p < .05. **p < .001.

Analysis of covariance
We ran an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to measure the unique predictive
validity of absolutist words after partialling out the effects of the
negative emotion words, pronouns, and certainty words. Negative emotions and
pronouns have previously been identified as strong linguistic markers of
affective disorder, and the certainty words index is the most conceptually
related to our absolutist index. We found that there was still a significant
main effect for the absolutist index between groups, after controlling for
the certainty index, negative emotions index, and the pronoun’s index,
F(3, 3860) = 20.575, p < .001.
Paired comparisons reveal that all contrasts remained significant to
p < .01.

Confirmatory factor analysis
For Study 1 forums, we calculated indices for each individual
word in the absolutist and nonabsolutist dictionaries
using an in-house python script (full python code is available in the
Supplemental Material) and the Natural Language Tool Kit (Bird, Klein, & Loper,
2009). This means that we had the percentage prevalence of each
word rather than each dictionary. Using these data, we
conducted a confirmatory factor analysis on the combined list of 65
absolutist and nonabsolutist words with a direct oblimin rotation and a
loadings cutoff > 0.55. We found that the highest loading words on the
first factor were all absolutist except for really (which
is an adverbial intensifier) and anything, which we had
originally categorized as absolutist but, because of a lack of independent
expert validation, was moved to the nonabsolutist dictionary. The highest
loading words on Factor 2 were all nonabsolutist except for the absolutist
word definitely. Other than definitely, no
absolutist word loaded outside of Factor 1. The factor analysis was not able
to separate “extreme words” from nonabsolutist words (see Table S3 in the Supplemental Material). To examine the
absolutism factor further, we used structural equation modeling to test the
model fit of the seven highest loading words on Factor 1 from the factor
analysis. Model fit was assessed using AMOS version 24 (SPSS). A seven-item,
one-factor model adequately fit the data (χ2 = 14.461,
df = 14, goodness of fit index = .912, comparative fit
index = .996, normed fit index = .903). Including more words in the model
reduced the model fit below generally accepted levels.

Sensitivity analysis
The smallest group in this study is the suicidal ideation group. Inferences
about this group are based on data from 368 members in four separate
suicidal ideation forums. Moreover, these forums may be perceived as less
conventional than others used in this research. For this reason, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis to ensure the results obtained from this
group are robust. The multilevel mixed-effects model for the absolutist
index was recalculated after sequentially excluding all data from each of
the suicidal ideation forums in turn. This produced four sets of test
statistics, each with one suicidal ideation forum excluded. Paired
comparisons showed that the absolutist index for the suicidal ideation group
remained significantly greater than the control group (ps
< .001, ds = 3.85–4.41), the anxiety group
(ps < .001, ds = 1.39–1.71), and
the depression group (ps < .001, ds =
1.37–1.69). The narrow range of effect sizes for each comparison confirms
that these findings are robust, and not driven by a forum outlier in the
suicidal ideation group.

Study 2
Multilevel mixed-effects model for the absolutist index
Our third hypothesis predicted that mental health forum groups strongly
associated with absolutist thinking (BPD and ED) would use more absolutist
words than mental health forum groups less associated with absolutist
thinking (PTSD and schizophrenia). A multilevel mixed-effects analysis found
that there was a significant difference in the absolutist index between
Study 2 groups, F(3, 16) = 5.515, p =
.009. Paired comparisons revealed that the mean absolutist index for the BPD
forum group (M = 1.47, SD = 1.01) was
significantly greater than the PTSD (M = 1.13,
SD = 0.83, p < .001,
d = 0.36, 95% CI = [−0.07, −0.02]) and the
schizophrenia forum groups (M = 1.14, SD =
0.86, p < .001, d = 0.35, 95% CI =
[−0.07, −0.03]). They also revealed that the absolutist index of the ED
forum group (M = 1.25, SD = 0.95) was
significantly greater than the schizophrenia (p = .009,
d = 0.12, 95% CI = [−0.04, −0.001]) but not PTSD
(p = .081, d = 0.13, 95% CI = [−0.03,
0.01]) forum groups (Fig.
1b). A critical assumption in this contrast, is that the control
and test groups have similar levels of psychological distress. We sought to
verify this assumption using the LIWC negative emotions dictionary. A paired
comparison found no significant difference in the mean negative emotions
index between the Study 2 control (M = 3.51,
SD = 2.02) and test (M = 3.71,
SD = 1.76, p = .335) forum groups
(Fig. 1c).
Therefore, it seems that absolutism is associated with certain types of
psychopathology forums and not psychological distress forums per
se.

Comparison of Study 1 with Study 2
In comparing the absolutist index of Study 1 and 2 groups, post hoc
comparisons with a Bonferroni correction revealed that the suicidal ideation
forum group had an index significantly greater than ED and BPD forum groups
(p < .001). ED but not BPD had an index
significantly lower than anxiety and depression forum groups
(ps = .001). Study 2 control forum groups PTSD and
schizophrenia had an index significantly lower than all Study 1 test forum
groups (ps < .001).

Sensitivity analysis
The smallest group in this study is the BPD group. Inferences about this
group are based on data from 326 members in four separate BPD forums. This
group also produced the most extreme absolutist index scores. Once again, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis to ensure the results obtained from this
group are robust. The multilevel mixed-effects model for the absolutist
index was recalculated after sequentially excluding all data from each of
the BPD forums in turn. This produced four sets of test statistics, each
with one BPD forum excluded. Paired comparisons show that the absolutist
index for the BPD group remained significantly greater than the PTSD group
(ps < .026, ds = 1.25–1.91) and the
schizophrenia group (ps < .008, ds =
1.56–2.24). Once again, the positive findings from the smallest group in the
study appear to be robust and not dependent on any single forum outlier.

Study 3
Multilevel mixed-effects model for the absolutist index
Our final hypothesis predicted that the recovery forum group would use
significantly more absolutist words than the Study 1 control forum group.
Paired comparisons in a multilevel mixed-effects model found that the mean
absolutist index of the recovery forum group (M = 1.31%,
SD = 0.95) was significantly greater than the Study 1
control forum group (p < .001, 95% CI = [−0.09, −0.05],
d = 0.37). Paired comparisons also found a significant
difference in the absolutist index between the recovery forum group and the
anxiety group (p = .018, 95% CI = [−0.001, 0.04],
d = 0.15) and depression group (p =
.018, 95% CI = [−0.001, 0.04], d = 0.15). Like the anxiety
and depression groups, the recovery group also had a significantly lower
absolutist index than the suicidal ideation group (p <
.001, 95% CI = [−0.06, −0.12], d = 0.50). Although the
absolutist index of the recovery group was significantly different from
anxiety and depression groups, the more accurate bias-corrected CIs reveal
that the differences are marginal; relative effect sizes reveal that the
recovery group absolutist index is closer to anxiety and depression
(d = 0.15) than to the control group
(d = 0.37; Fig. 2a). We noted earlier that the
contents of the recovery forums were very positive. To illustrate this fact,
we ran the LIWC positive emotions dictionary on the above groups (Fig. 2b). There was
indeed a very large difference in the prevalence of positive emotions.
Paired comparisons found that the recovery forum group contained more
positive emotion words than all the remaining groups (ps
< .001).

words for the recovery group and all Study 1 groups (control,
anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation). Error bars indicate 95%
bootstrapped confidence intervals.

Sensitivity analysis
Although the recovery group is relatively large, with 558 members in 7
different forums, this group is somewhat unconventional and the number of
members in each forum were somewhat unequal (see Table S1). We therefore deemed it appropriate to conduct
another sensitivity analysis to ensure the results obtained from this group
are robust. The multilevel mixed-effects model for the absolutist index was
recalculated after sequentially excluding all data from each of the recovery
forums in turn. This produced seven sets of test statistics, each with one
recovery forum excluded. Paired comparisons show that the absolutist index
for the recovery group remained significantly greater than the control group
(ps < .001, ds = 1.88–2.30). This
again confirms that the positive findings from this group are robust and not
dependent on any single forum outlier.

Discussion
Main findings
The data we have presented confirm that the use of absolutist words is elevated
in the natural language of various affective disorder forum groups. As expected,
in Study 1 we found that the percentage of absolutist words in anxiety,
depression, and suicidal ideation test groups was significantly greater than in
control groups (H1), and that the percentage of
absolutist words in the suicidal ideation forum group was significantly greater
than in both the anxiety and depression forum groups
(H2). These findings have support from a
previous study, Fekete
(2002) used an adapted Weintraub text analysis method on four
Internet forums (suicide, depression, anxiety, and a journalism control). They
found significant results for 13 language variables including negations and
dichotomous expressions. Our first study has built on this preliminary finding,
using a wider range of more rigorous controls, a larger corpus of data, and a
hypothesis-driven study design.

In Study 2, consistent with our expectations, we found the absolutist index was
greater for BPD and ED forums than PTSD and schizophrenia forums, although this
did not reach significance between ED and PTSD. All four mental health groups
contained similar amounts of negative emotion terms, but only BPD and ED are
strongly associated with absolutist thinking. This suggests that our index is
more sensitive to absolutism than psychological distress.

In Study 3, we proposed that if the absolutist index for the recovery forums was
similar to depression forums, this would suggest that absolutist thinking has
some trait-like qualities that persist outside of depressive episodes. This is
indeed what we observed. Even though the recovery forums were largely very
positive, the percentage of absolutist words in the recovery group had
overlapping CIs with both the anxiety and depression forum groups, and was
significantly greater than the control forum group. It is widely acknowledged
that an episode of depression increases the risk of future depressive episodes
(Teasdale et al.,
2000). In many ways, preventing this recurrence is the focus of most
treatments. Consequently, there is keen interest in identifying potential
cognitive vulnerability factors which are observed during episodes of depression
and persist even after the episode has ended. Our findings indicate that
absolutism may be such a vulnerability factor. The “scar hypothesis” (Lewinsohn, Steinmetz, Larson,
& Franklin, 1981) provides a different explanation. Here the
depressive episode itself alters the linguistic style/vocabulary of the
individual, this then persists as a “scar” after the depressive episode has
abated.

Comparison with other dictionaries
Text analysis research on written data from depressed and suicidal individuals
has repeatedly shown elevated use of negative emotion words and pronouns (for
review, see Tausczik &
Pennebaker, 2010). We also found these to be strong markers of
affective disorder in the present study. However, we have paradoxically found
that “negative emotions,” “sad,” “affect,” and “feel” dictionaries were more
prevalent in anxiety and depression than the suicidal ideation group. This is
inconsistent with the belief that suicidal individuals have a greater amount of
negative emotions (de Klerk
et al., 2011; Orbach, Mikulincer, Gilboa-Schechtman, & Sirota, 2003; Stein, Apter, Ratzoni,
Har-Even, & Avidan, 1998), and some research has previously shown
that “negative emotion [words] use tends to increase approaching suicide” (Pennebaker & Chung,
2013). These mixed findings only reaffirm that “function” words are a
better gauge of thinking processes than “content” words (Chung & Pennebaker, 2007). Our
absolutist dictionary also produced larger effects than pronouns (and its
first-person singular subcategory), which had previously been identified as
better markers of affective disorder than negative emotion words (Pennebaker & Chung,
2013).

The LIWC “certainty” index (Table 2) is the most closely related to our absolutist index,
comprising words that denote high or total certainty. Although indeed similar,
the certainty index does not include some words that are absolutist (i.e.,
“nothing”) and contains others that are not (i.e., “frankly”). Moreover, unlike
our absolutist dictionary, many of its component words are not neutrally
valenced (i.e., perfect).

Finally, we found that “swear” words produced a similar significance pattern to
absolutist words (Table
2). Swear words are commonly used as adverbial intensifiers (Peters, 1994; Romero, 2013). For
example, instead of writing “I’m completely sick of this,”
depressed/suicidal individuals may write something akin to “I’m
fucking sick of this,” replacing the absolutist word
“completely” with something even more forceful, both functionally serving as
adverbial intensifiers of the strongest kind.

Absolute versus extreme
Previous studies have often used the terms absolute and extreme interchangeably
(e.g., Teasdale et al.,
2001). A central assumption in the present research is that
absolutist words are uncorrelated with extreme words; this assumption was
tested. We found that only 25% of absolutist words were also deemed extreme by
some of the independent expert judges. Moreover, none of the words we had
categorized as extreme were deemed absolutist, with the single exception of
really, which was categorized as absolutist by one out of
the five judges. This was reaffirmed by the confirmatory factor analysis
(Table S3), in which only words we had categorized as absolutist
loaded onto Factor 1, with the single exception, once again, of the adverbial
intensifier really. We believe that a clear distinction should
be made between these two concepts in future research; and that the terms should
not be used interchangeably.

Anxiety and depression within control groups
Individuals with cancer, PTSD, and schizophrenia have high levels of comorbid
anxiety and depression. This might lead us to expect a higher absolutist index
for these forum groups. However, the cancer group produced an absolutist index
identical to the other Study 1 control groups; and the PTSD and schizophrenia
groups had a significantly lower absolutist index than all Study 1 test groups.
This may be because symptoms of anxiety and depression in cancer, PTSD, and
schizophrenia have a known specific cause, namely, having cancer, PTSD, or
schizophrenia. One does not have to be absolutist, or even disposed to affective
disorder, to experience feelings of anxiety or depression about a brain tumor, a
traumatic event, or hallucinations. In contrast, anxiety and depression
disorders often have multiple vague or even unknown causes. Predisposed
individuals are pushed into anxiety and depression by circumstances that by
necessity would not have the same effect in the general population.

Implications
The maladaptive status of absolutist thinking is a recognized part of cognitive
therapy (CT; C. Williams
& Garland, 2002). To date, theoretical and anecdotal support has
mostly served as the basis for its inclusion; we hope the findings from our
studies will add empirical justification. The extent to which absolutist
thinking is currently addressed by CT depends on the form of CT used and the
preferred methods of each practitioner. For example, combatting absolutist
thinking is at the very core of rational-emotive behavioral therapy (David, Lynn, & Ellis,
2009), whereas reducing negative thoughts takes primacy in other
forms of CT. Recently, research into treating cognitive vulnerabilities and
preventing relapse has migrated toward the new “third-wave” therapies (Teasdale et al., 2000).
These therapies, such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and acceptance and
commitment therapy, are largely geared toward increasing cognitive flexibility
(e.g., Kahl, Winter, &
Schweiger, 2012). Our findings are therefore in step with the recent
trend toward cultivating adaptive cognitive processes (i.e.,
flexibility) as distinct from changing the content of thoughts
(i.e., negativity).

Limitations and future directions
Because this study had large samples from multiple sources, and a naturalistic
observational design, it consequently had low experimental control. For example,
we could only infer general demographic characteristics from different forums
(e.g., women post on Mumsnet and young people post on Student Room). Usernames
served to distinguish members, however it is possible that some members might
post using more than one profile or use different usernames for different
forums. Fundamentally, the identities and motivation of users are largely
unknowable, and this is an inevitable limitation in this study. As outlined in
the methods, we did check that the authors of posts were at least purporting to
be a representative of the relevant online community, but we had no power to go
beyond this basic check. Follow-up studies could use an experimental study
design, and perhaps alternative methodologies, to replicate and extend the
findings initially presented here. Despite likely being limited to a smaller
sample size and perhaps lacking ecological validity, such studies would be able
to control participant characteristics, writing topics and the setting.

Our findings in this study relate to differences between groups, such an analysis
provides important insights into the markers associated with affective disorder.
However, in this research, we have not addressed within-person variation in
absolutist thinking and how that relates to changes in affective symptoms at an
individual level (cf. Molenaar & Campbell, 2009). For example, are individual changes
in suicidal ideation over time reflected in changes in use of absolutist words?
Future research could seek to track absolutist thinking (and affective disorder)
in individuals over time. This could have even greater utility for clinical
practice.

In measuring aggregate differences in absolutist words between groups we have not
examined the specific nature of the relationship. Although we present data that
may point to absolutism as a possible cognitive vulnerability factor, the extent
and mechanism of any causal role are not addressed here. Future intervention
studies could examine the causal status of absolutist thinking; one possibility
would be to use a cognitive bias modification paradigm (Hallion & Ruscio, 2011). The aim
would be to introduce some manipulation of absolutist thinking in participants
and then examine the subsequent effects. Alternatively, a narrow form of
cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on targeting absolutist thinking could
be clinically trialed.
