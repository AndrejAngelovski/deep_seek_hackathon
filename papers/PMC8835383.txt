==== Body
pmcThere is concern about the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on mental health and, more specifically, on the incidence of psychotic disorders. However, limited evidence is available to examine predictions and to plan preventive measures.1

We reviewed the clinical data of patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and presenting a chief complaint related to the COVID-19 pandemic. All patients were evaluated at the psychiatric emergency unit of Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), between March and August 2020, in São Paulo, Brazil. Confidentiality of all subjects was preserved, and the study was approved by the research ethics committee of the UNIFESP (CAAE 33124620.0.0000.5505). Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, diagnostic hypotheses, and complementary information are presented in Table 1.

* According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5).2

Of 12 individuals, 4 (33.3%) presented new-onset psychosis, while 8 had a previous history of psychotic symptoms. Among new-onset patients, the diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5),2 was the most prevalent one (75%). Eight patients (66.6%) were hospitalized due to severe psychomotor agitation and/or suicidal ideation. Seven of them received a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and one received a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder. All cases presented delusions or hallucinations with content related to the pandemic.

Psychotic symptoms can be understood as a cognitive scheme developed to explain an aberrant salience experience,3 and they commonly incorporate external (recent or stressful) events,4 such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosis may emerge via two non-competing pathways in the context of the pandemic. First, there is the psychological distress leading to brief psychotic reactions or anticipating disease onset/relapse in those more genetically vulnerable. Second, psychosis may be a result of the direct effect of the viral infection on the brain, including post-viral presentations and treatment-related complications such as steroid-induced psychosis.5

Only one individual had a history of COVID-19 infection, but there were no signs of clinical impairment related to viral infection or complications. Three out of four patients with new-onset psychosis did not present prodromal features of psychotic disorders, i.e., they presented delusion but neither gross disorganization nor negative symptoms. Also, these patients had an atypical age of onset for first-episode psychosis,6 and presented lower psychiatric risks or need for hospitalization, as opposed to patients with a previous history of psychotic symptoms. Such features suggest a more benign evolution and demand closer follow-up to define the need to maintain antipsychotic treatment and titration, avoiding unnecessary harm due to treatment.7

In conclusion, we observed two patterns of psychotic disorders related to the psychological distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) brief, apparently mild new-onset cases; and 2) relapse of previously diagnosed patients. The reduced number of cases directly associated with viral infection can be explained by the study design, which included patients who directly sought psychiatric care. Moreover, it can suggest that psychological distress represents a higher burden to psychotic outcomes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but this needs to be addressed in larger, representative samples. Further epidemiological studies are needed to assess a possible increased risk for psychotic disorders related to the pandemic, and follow-up studies can help to better understand the evolution and clinical outcome of the related disorder.
