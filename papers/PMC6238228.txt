Despite metacognition occupying a central role in human psychology, its neural
substrates remain underdetermined, partly due to study-specific differences in
task domain and type of metacognitive judgement under study. It is also unclear
how metacognition relates to other apparently similar abilities that depend on
recursive thought such as theory of mind or mentalising. Now that neuroimaging
studies of metacognition are more prevalent, we have an opportunity to
characterise consistencies in neural substrates identified across different
analysis types and domains. Here we used quantitative activation likelihood
estimation methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging studies on
metacognition, divided into categories based on the target of metacognitive
evaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type (judgement-related
activation, confidence-related activation, and predictors of metacognitive
sensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and
retrospective). A domain-general network, including medial and lateral
prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula was associated with the level of
confidence in self-performance in both decision-making and memory tasks. We
found preferential engagement of right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
in metadecision experiments and bilateral parahippocampal cortex in metamemory
experiments. Results on metacognitive sensitivity were inconclusive, likely due
to fewer studies reporting this contrast. Finally, by comparing our results to
meta-analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common engagement of the
ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both metacognition
and mentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order
representations for thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others.

Introduction
Metacognition allows reflection upon and control of other cognitive processes such as
perception, decision-making, and memory (Metcalfe and Shimamura, 1996). Efforts to
quantify metacognition have focussed on how people judge their performance
(second-order judgements) in a variety of domains (Fleming and Lau, 2014). For instance, in
perceptual decision-making tasks, a first-order discrimination is made about a
stimulus (e.g. orientation of a grating), followed by a second-order assessment of
confidence of whether the first-order discrimination is likely to be correct.
Effective metacognitive monitoring is important for behavioural control, such as
when one recognises a poor decision and pursues an alternative course of action.
Accounting for deficits in metacognitive function may shed light on the causes of a
lack of insight into neuropsychiatric disorders and reveal possible diagnostic and
therapeutic options which target metacognitive abnormalities (David et al., 2014; Koren et al., 2006).

Despite a central role for metacognition in the monitoring and control of behaviour,
the relevant neurocognitive architecture supporting metacognition remains poorly
understood. Initial neuropsychological studies pointed to the importance of the
frontal lobe in second-order judgements about memory performance (Janowsky et al., 1989;
Shimamura and Squire,
1986), with selective deficits in metacognition observed in conditions
such as Korsakoff’s syndrome associated with frontal atrophy. In parallel, studies
of performance monitoring identified neural signals involved in error monitoring
originating in posterior medial frontal cortex (Dehaene et al., 1994; Gehring et al., 1993). Since the
introduction of these seminal studies, a standard approach leverages modern
neuroimaging methods to identify neural correlates of metacognitive judgements
across different tasks, primarily recognition memory (metamemory), and perceptual
and value-based decision-making (which we collectively refer to here as
‘metadecision’). Such research has confirmed the involvement of a frontoparietal
network in metacognition (Fleming and Dolan, 2014) and begun to assign distinct computational
roles to elements within this network (Bang and Fleming, 2018; Kepecs et al., 2008; Kiani and Shadlen, 2009;
Miyamoto et al.,
2018).

A complementary but hitherto distinct perspective on the brain basis for
metacognition is provided by studies of theory of mind (ToM) – the capacity to
understand others’ mental states and to appreciate that these may differ from our
own. Carruthers’ interpretive sensory-access (ISA) theory proposes that
self-directed metacognition relies on turning a specialised circuit for mindreading
on ourselves, to indirectly infer our state of mind (Carruthers, 2009, 2011; Frith, 2012). This view is related to a
recent proposal that confidence in our own actions is formed via a second-order
evaluation of a coupled but distinct decision system, computationally equivalent to
inferring the performance of another actor (Fleming and Daw, 2017). Indirect evidence
for this view has been found in developmental studies that reveal the ability to
explicitly monitor self-performance (using confidence ratings) is gained at around
the same age (4–5 years old) as children begin to pass false-belief tests (Hembacher and Ghetti, 2014;
Lockl and Schneider,
2007). Neuroimaging studies of mentalising have also highlighted a
frontoparietal network, with meta-analyses identifying anterior dorsal medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and precuneus as
key nodes (Amodio and Frith,
2006; Frith and
Frith, 1999; Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et al., 2014). However, given that
relatively less is known about the neural basis of metacognition than ToM, whether
metacognition and ToM (and mentalising more specifically) share neural substrates
remains an open question (Lombardo et al., 2010; Schilbach et al., 2012; Valk et al., 2016).

When drawing inferences about the architecture of metacognition from individual
studies, it is important to consider the class of second-order judgement being
elicited (Schwartz and Diaz,
2014). Metacognitive judgements can be subdivided by both domain and
temporal focus – retrospective or prospective (Fleming and Dolan, 2014). For instance,
judgements of confidence or monitoring for errors are retrospective
judgements of performance, whereas prospective judgements
(typically used in metamemory tasks) include ‘feelings of knowing’ (FOKs) and
‘judgements of learning’ (JOLs) that refer to one’s future task performance. Lateral
and medial aspects of prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been suggested to support
retrospective and prospective judgements, respectively (Fleming and Dolan, 2014; Pannu et al., 2005).
However, direct neuroimaging evidence for a distinction between different judgement
types is surprisingly limited. In one of the few studies to directly compare
activation related to retrospective confidence ratings and prospective FOKs, Chua et al. (2009) found
that prospective judgements are associated with medial parietal and medial temporal
lobe (MTL) activation, whereas retrospective judgements were related to inferior
prefrontal activity. However, the same study also found that both forms of
metamemory activated common regions of medial and lateral PFC, and mid-posterior
areas of cingulate cortex, indicating differences may be of degree rather than of
kind.

An interrelated question is whether metacognition relies on a common, domain-general
resource that is recruited to evaluate performance across a variety of first-order
tasks, or whether metacognition is supported by domain-specific components. Current
behavioural evidence for a domain-general resource is mixed: some studies find that
efficient metacognition in one task predicts good metacognition in another (Ais et al., 2016; Faivre et al., 2018; McCurdy et al., 2013; Schraw, 1996; Song et al., 2011), whereas
others argue for a separation between metacognitive abilities (Baird et al., 2013; Fitzgerald et al., 2017; Garfinkel et al., 2016;
Morales et al., 2018;
Kelemen et al.,
2000). Moreover, a correlation in behavioural measures does not necessarily
mean they share the same (neural) resource, as even correlated metacognitive
functions can be associated with distinct neurostructural profiles (Mccurdy et al., 2013; Rouault et al., in press).
Recent neuroimaging studies have highlighted both domain-general and domain-specific
neural substrates (Baird et al.,
2013, 2015;
Chiou et al., 2011;
Fleming et al., 2014;
Morales et al., 2018;
Valk et al., 2016),
with metamemory broadly hypothesised to recruit parietal and midline prefrontal
regions, while metadecision recruits frontal regions including anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC), insula, and lateral anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC; Baird et al., 2013).
However, direct comparisons between domains remain rare.

In sum, the neurocognitive architecture of metacognition remains underdetermined,
partly due to study-specific differences in task domain and type of metacognitive
judgement under study. Now that neuroimaging studies of metacognition are more
prevalent, we have an opportunity to characterise consistencies in neural substrates
of metacognition identified across different studies and task domains. In this
study, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE; Eickhoff et al., 2009) to perform
meta-analyses of the current neuroimaging literature on metacognition across the two
most studied domains: decision-making and memory. We also sought to analyse
distinctions between different aspects of metacognitive judgements (e.g. their level
and sensitivity to performance) and, within metamemory studies, their temporal focus
(prospective vs retrospective). Our study thus builds on and extends a previous
meta-analysis that focussed on retrospective confidence judgements about memory
(White et al.,
2014). Finally, we also compare the results of our meta-analysis of
self-directed metacognition to networks engaged during mentalising about others.

Methods
Identifying candidate studies
Candidate studies for inclusion were initially identified from a PubMed search
using the following string: (metacognition OR metamemory OR metacognitive OR
‘decision confidence’ OR ‘memory confidence’ OR ‘feeling of knowing’ OR
‘judgment of learning’ OR ‘error awareness’ OR ‘tip of the tongue’) AND (MRI OR
fMRI OR ‘magnetic resonance imaging’). This string returned 169 records on 25
March 2018. The following selection criteria were used to identify studies for
further evaluation: (1) studies reported in peer-reviewed journals published in
English; (2) use of functional or structural MRI with associated behavioural
measurements; (3) the task involved a metacognitive judgement by the subject;
(4) stereotactic three-dimensional (3D) coordinates were reported from
whole-brain analyses; (5) the study reported a contrast that fell into at least
one of our analysis categories of interest (judgement-related activation,
confidence-related activation or neural correlates of metacognitive sensitivity;
refer section ‘Analysis’); and (6) the study includes data from healthy
participants. Our meta-analysis differed from that of White et al. (2014) in which we
required an explicit metacognitive judgement from the subject (their ‘Type B’
studies), while excluding studies which solely manipulated environmental
uncertainty (their ‘Type A’ category).

From studies that met these criteria, we further limited our cohort to the two
most prevalent domains in the literature: metacognition of decision-making
(metadecision) and metacognition of memory (metamemory). Other less frequently
studied tasks (i.e. metacognition of emotion) were excluded from analysis. Of
these 169 initial results, 34 met our criteria. To ensure our search was
comprehensive, we also consulted studies cited in review chapters from ‘The
Cognitive Neuroscience of Metacognition’ book (Fleming and Frith, 2014) and searched
the following string on Google Scholar: (metacognition OR metacognitive OR
‘error awareness’ OR ‘feeling of knowing’ OR ‘memory confidence’ OR ‘decision
confidence’ OR metamemory) AND (fMRI OR MRI). These two sources resulted in an
additional 13 studies that met our criteria.

Final corpus
The final corpus of 47 studies included a total of 88 analysis contrasts, 739
activation foci, and 2215 participants (see Table S1 in Supplementary Materials for full details). The
number of participants in each study ranged from 11 to 191 with a mean of 47.13.
One of the included studies (Hester et al., 2009) reported data collected from patient
populations, but only the results from the control group were included.
Coordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to Montreal Neurological
Institute coordinates using the algorithm in the GingerALE software (Eickhoff et al.,
2009).

Analysis
Activation-level estimation analyses were run using GingerALE (version 2.3.6)
software (Eickhoff et al.,
2009, 2012). The most recent instantiation of the ALE algorithm tests for
clustering of peak foci from different experiments against an ALE null
distribution created by randomly redistributing the same number of foci
throughout the brain volume. In a typical study, the same group of subjects will
contribute data to multiple statistical contrasts, and consequently, the
activation patterns produced by different contrasts do not constitute
independent observations. We therefore organised reported foci according to
subject group (rather than contrast) and used the modified ALE algorithm to
address this issue, as recommended by Turkeltaub et al. (2012). All
coordinate files used in the analysis are available for download at https://github.com/metacoglab/VaccaroFleming.

Included activation foci were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel whose size
depended on the sample size (larger samples result in a smaller smoothing
kernel; Eickhoff et al.,
2009, 2012). Multiple-comparisons correction was applied at the cluster level
at a family-wise error-corrected threshold of p < .05, 5000
permutations, and a cluster-forming threshold of p < .001
uncorrected. The resulting statistical maps indicate areas of the brain where
convergence between activation foci is greater than would be expected by chance
(i.e. a null distribution of clusters). We followed similar methods to those
used in other recent ALE studies (Garrison et al., 2013; Pollack and Ashby,
2018; Sokolowski et
al., 2017). 3D statistical maps can be viewed at https://neurovault.org/collections/4238/.

Activations were labelled using a combination of group atlases and anatomical
landmarks. For greater specificity in labelling clusters obtained within PFC, we
also referenced coordinates against the Oxford atlases included in the FMRIB
Software Library (FSL; Jenkinson et al., 2012). These atlases are derived from studies
using diffusion-tensor imaging to subdivide regions sharing common connectivity
fingerprints, including dorsal and ventral PFC, cingulate cortex, and
orbitofrontal cortex (Neubert et al., 2014, 2015; Sallet et al., 2013).

Classification of contrasts of interest
In addition to classifying activation foci by domain (metadecision and
metamemory), we also subdivided contrasts by analysis type, collapsing across
domains. We identified three common contrasts of interest (Chua et al., 2014). ‘Judgment-related
activity’ refers to contrasts comparing the requirement for a metacognitive
judgement against a baseline or control condition. ‘Parametric effect of
confidence’ refers to contrasts identifying activations that scale with the
metacognitive judgement, such as a negative/positive parametric effect of JOL or
confidence rating. ‘Metacognitive sensitivity’ refers to analyses identifying
differences in the extent to which metacognitive judgements track objective task
performance. Finally, for metamemory judgements, we also divided judgements by
temporal focus (prospective and retrospective), while collapsing over contrast
type. The one exception to this tripartite classification of analyses was for
studies using the ‘Error Awareness Task’ (Hester et al., 2005). In this task,
subjects are asked to detect each time they make an error on a go/no-go task,
which is typically only achieved around 70% of the time. This feature of the
task permits a contrast between ‘aware’ (reported) and ‘unaware’ (unreported)
errors. We classified this contrast as both judgement and confidence related, as
it reflects the deployment of a metacognitive judgement and lowered confidence
in performance.

We conducted eight distinct meta-analyses: (1) all metacognition-related
activations, collapsing over both domain and analysis type, (2)
judgement-related activations, collapsing over domain, (3) parametric effects of
confidence, collapsing over domain, (4) correlates of metacognitive sensitivity,
collapsing over domain, (5) metamemory-related activations, collapsing over
contrast type, (6) metadecision-related activations, collapsing over contrast
type, (7) prospective metamemory-related activations, collapsing over contrast
type, and (8) retrospective metamemory-related activations, collapsing over
contrast type.

Comparing metacognition and ToM
To compare metacognition-related activations in our de novo meta-analysis to
those associated with ToM, we obtained the ‘reverse inference’ map associated
with the term ‘mentalising’ from Neurosynth (www.neurosynth.org,
accessed June 2018). Neurosynth uses text-mining combined with meta-analysis to
generate a large database of mappings between neural and cognitive states (Yarkoni et al., 2011).
A reverse inference map displays brain regions that are preferentially related
to mentalising over and above other terms in the database (i.e. that show a high
posterior probability P(mentalising|activation)). The map is corrected for
multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) approach at
p < 0.01. We computed the overlap between the Neurosynth
mentalising map and our composite map of metacognition-related activity to
examine common and distinct regional engagement. Note that while both maps are
corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole-brain volume, the numerical
values and thresholds are not comparable, as they are obtained via different
meta-analytic methods (ALE for metacognition and multilevel kernel density
analysis (MKDA) for mentalising).

Results
Composite meta-analysis of metacognition-related activity
Collapsing across all 47 studies (739 foci), eight significant clusters were
identified: in posterior mPFC (paracingulate gyrus/dorsal ACC), left and right
insula/inferior frontal gyrus, left and right dorsolateral PFC, ventromedial
PFC, right ventral striatum, and right dorsal precuneus (Table 1 and Figure 1). Notably, the activation in
right dorsolateral PFC was more anterior (anterior border y = 56) than that on
the left (anterior border y = 40).

Meta-analysis of judgement-related activity
We next separated activation foci by contrast type. A common distinction in the
metacognition literature is between activations related to the requirement for a
metacognitive judgement (judgement-related activity vs baseline/control) and
those tracking judgement level (e.g. parametric effect of confidence). The
analysis of judgement-related activity included 12 studies (94 foci). This
analysis did not yield consistent clusters, perhaps reflecting a lack of power
given that between 17–20 experiments are typically considered necessary for a
well-powered neuroimaging meta-analysis (Muller et al., 2018). For completeness,
in Supplementary Materials, we include an exploratory analysis of
judgement-related effects at p < .001, uncorrected, minimum
cluster size 200 mm3 (Table S2 and Figure S1).

Meta-analysis of parametric effects of confidence level
We next examined parametric contrasts for activations co-varying positively or
negatively with metacognitive ratings (e.g. the level of confidence or magnitude
of JOL). This analysis included 36 studies (606 foci). Nine significant clusters
were identified: in posterior medial frontal cortex, left and right
insula/inferior frontal gyrus, left dorsolateral PFC, ventromedial PFC, right
dorsal precuneus, left lateral parietal cortex, and right ventral striatum
(Table 2 and
Figure 2).

the cluster level at a family-wise error-corrected threshold of
p < .05, 5000 permutations, and a
cluster-defining threshold of p < .001

Meta-analysis of metacognitive sensitivity
Our final contrast type related to metacognitive sensitivity – the extent to
which confidence effectively tracks task performance across trials. A high
degree of metacognitive sensitivity is obtained when people ascribe high
confidence to correct decisions, and low confidence to incorrect decisions.
Because sensitivity is a property of multiple trials, it is typically analysed
as a between-subjects variable.

A total of 11 studies in our corpus reported results pertaining to metacognitive
sensitivity (61 foci). With cluster-correction, this analysis did not yield any
consistent clusters, again consistent with a lack of power due to a limited
number of studies. For completeness, in Supplementary Materials, we include an exploratory analysis of
sensitivity-related effects at p < .001, uncorrected,
minimum cluster size 200 mm3 (Table S2 and Figure S1).

Composite meta-analysis of metadecision-related activity
We next turned to the distinction between metacognition-related activations
across domains (metadecision and metamemory) while collapsing over contrast
type. For metadecision, we identified 20 studies (211 foci). Five clusters were
found: one in right anterior dorsolateral PFC, two in posterior medial frontal
cortex, and two in right insula/inferior frontal gyrus. In line with previous
observations in the literature, we found that activations for metadecision were
predominantly lateralised to the right hemisphere (Fleming and Dolan, 2014; Schmitz et al., 2004)
(Table 3 and
Figure 3).

Composite meta-analysis of metamemory-related activity
Collapsing across contrast type, the ALE meta-analysis of metamemory included 30
studies (528 foci). Six significant clusters were identified: in left
dorsolateral PFC, posterior mPFC (paracingulate gyrus), left and right
insula/inferior frontal gyrus, and left and right parahippocampal gyrus (Table 4 and Figure 3).

Meta-analysis comparing prospective and retrospective metamemory
judgements
Within metamemory studies, we next examined possible differences in activation
profile associated with prospective and retrospective metamemory judgements
(Chua et al.,
2009). Prospective judgements (such as JOLs or FOKs) included 14
studies with 232 foci, and retrospective judgements (such as recognition
confidence) included 17 studies with 287 foci. The prospective analysis yielded
three clusters: in posterior mPFC, left dorsolateral PFC, and right insula. The
retrospective analysis revealed three clusters: in bilateral parahippocampal
cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus (Table 5 and Figure 4).

Comparing metacognition and ToM
Finally, we examined a potential overlap between metacognition- and ToM-related
activations by comparing our composite metacognition map (Figure 1) to a meta-analysis of ToM.
ToM-related regions were obtained from the ‘reverse inference’ map for the term
‘mentalising’ in Neurosynth, which identifies regions that are preferentially
associated with ToM over and above other terms in the database.

Figure 5 shows the two
maps overlaid on the same cortical surface projection created using Surf Ice
(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/). Activations for both
metacognition and ToM were observed in mPFC and precuneus, with ToM activations
tending to be anterior and ventral to metacognition-related activations. There
was clear overlap between metacognition and ToM in vmPFC (cluster centre of mass
(–3, 45, –12)) and a region of mid-dorsomedial PFC ((–4, 40, 34); Figure 5, bottom row).
Unique activations for metacognition were observed in dorsolateral PFC, insula,
and lateral parietal cortex; unique activations for ToM were observed in TPJ and
temporal pole.

Discussion
Deficits in metacognition – the ability to reflect on our cognitive processes – have
clear and important consequences for functional capacity and quality of life, and
are often found in psychiatric and neurological conditions (David et al., 2014; Koren et al., 2006). Metacognition has been
considered a higher brain function that depends on the integrity of prefrontal and
parietal association cortex (Shimamura, 2000) and that is particularly well-developed in humans
compared to other animals (Metcalfe, 2008). However, the underlying neurocognitive architecture
supporting metacognitive abilities remains poorly understood. By comparing the
neural basis of metacognition across different judgement types (e.g. prospective
versus retrospective judgements of performance) and tasks (e.g. decision-making and
memory), we aimed to provide insight into the types of neurocognitive architecture
(e.g. domain-general or domain-specific) that support human metacognition. In turn,
we hope progress on this issue will aid in understanding the aetiology of
metacognitive deficits.

Here, we present a first meta-analysis of the current neuroimaging literature on
explicit metacognitive judgements of performance. We used quantitative ALE methods
to synthesise findings from 47 structural or functional neuroimaging studies on
metacognition, divided into categories based on domains (metamemory and
metadecision), analysis type (judgement-related activity, parametric effect of
confidence, and metacognitive sensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal
focus (prospective and retrospective). We also compared our results on self-directed
metacognition to those obtained in a previous meta-analysis of ToM, motivated by
theoretical proposals that self-knowledge partly depends on co-opting machinery that
originally evolved for mentalising about others (Carruthers, 2009, 2011; Fleming and Daw, 2017; Frith, 2012).

In a composite meta-analysis collapsing over both analysis type and domain, we found
consistent involvement of a frontoparietal network. Previous reviews have
highlighted the specific contribution of a network centred on medial/lateral aPFC in
metacognition (Fleming and
Dolan, 2014; Grimaldi
et al., 2015; Metcalfe and Schwartz, 2015). We found evidence in line with this view,
with metacognition-related activations in posterior mPFC, ventromedial PFC and
bilateral aPFC/dorsolateral PFC. Notably, the lateral PFC activations were
asymmetric: left lateral PFC was more posterior and corresponded closely to area 44d
from the atlas of Neubert et al.
(2014); the right lateral PFC cluster was more anterior, corresponding to
Neubert et al.’s area 46. In addition to these prefrontal activations, we also
observed the involvement of bilateral insula and dorsal precuneus. This is
consistent with an emerging view that the parietal cortex, particularly precuneus,
supports metacognition in concert with the PFC (Mccurdy et al., 2013; Simons et al., 2010). The insula, together
with posterior mPFC has been implicated in error processing and error awareness
(Bonini et al., 2014;
Garavan et al., 2003;
Ridderinkhof et al.,
2004; Taylor et al.,
2007; Ullsperger et
al., 2010), and is a hub for interoception (Craig, 2009), thought to be a key modulator
of, or input to, metacognitive appraisal (Allen et al., 2016; Stephan et al., 2016).

Subcomponents of metacognition
We next turn to the review results for each contrast type separately. Previous
studies have drawn a distinction between activations tracking the requirement
for a metacognitive judgement relative to a baseline or control condition and
those parametrically tracking the level of the judgement (e.g.
high vs low confidence). For judgement-related activity, we did not find any
consistent regions across the studies, likely due to this analysis being
underpowered, given the relatively fewer studies reporting results for this
contrast. In contrast, regions parametrically tracking confidence level were
widespread and highlight a similar network to that found in the composite
analysis (posterior mPFC, bilateral insula, right dorsal precuneus, ventral
striatum, left posterior dorsolateral PFC, and ventromedial PFC), suggesting
parametric effects were a predominant driver of the overall pattern. Parametric
effects of confidence in ventromedial PFC are consistent with recent findings
that perigenual ACC tracks determinants of subjective confidence arising from
multiple sources during perceptual decision-making (Bang and Fleming, 2018). We note,
however, that parametric relationships with confidence in this meta-analysis may
be due to a particular brain region tracking variables such as response time or
stimulus difficulty that themselves covary with confidence, and we are unable to
rule out the contribution of these covariates to these results.

A key aspect of metacognition is the extent to which judgements track objective
performance, known as metacognitive sensitivity. Sensitivity is defined as the
association between performance and confidence over multiple trials and is
typically measured using individual-difference metrics such as area under the
type 2 receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC2) or
meta-d’ (Fleming and Lau, 2014). Measures of
metacognitive sensitivity are affected by task performance (Galvin et al., 2003;
Maniscalco and Lau,
2012), making it important to control for differences in task
performance either in the design of experiments (e.g. by using staircase
procedures) or in analysis by computing metrics such as metacognitive efficiency
(meta-d’/d’).

In the current meta-analysis, 9 of 11 studies reporting neural correlates of
metacognitive sensitivity controlled for performance either in the design of the
experiment or in data analysis. Unfortunately, this small sample was likely
underpowered for the purposes of the current meta-analysis (Muller et al., 2018),
and no significant clusters were observed after correction for multiple
comparisons. However, at uncorrected thresholds, we observed involvement of a
right aPFC region that was not observed in the parametric confidence
meta-analysis (Figure S1). This pattern may indicate that the aPFC plays a role
downstream of confidence formation – instead of monitoring performance, aPFC may
contribute to updating a mapping between an internal feeling of confidence and
the usage of confidence in communication or subsequent control of behaviour
(Shekhar and Rahnev,
2018). However, further studies of the neural basis of metacognitive
sensitivity (as opposed to confidence level per se) are required to test this
hypothesis. The small number of studies reporting sensitivity analyses meant
that we were also unable to establish potential domain-specific differences in
the neural basis of metacognitive sensitivity, although recent studies have
highlighted a specific contribution of precuneus to metamemory sensitivity
(Baird et al.,
2013, 2015;
Mccurdy et al.,
2013; Ye et al.,
2018).

Comparing metamemory and metadecision
We observed common regions in separate analyses of metamemory and metadecision
tasks, including insula, lateral PFC, and posterior mPFC, suggesting common
inputs may drive judgements in both domains (Morales et al., 2018). This metamemory
network is similar to that identified by White et al. (2014) in a meta-analysis
of nine studies examining retrospective confidence judgements about memory. We
also observed partially distinct networks engaged during metacognition of
decision-making and memory tasks. Specific to the metamemory analysis were
activations in left dorsolateral PFC and clusters in bilateral parahippocampal
cortex, whereas specific to metadecision was the involvement of right anterior
dorso lateral PFC.

Temporal focus of metamemory judgements
When separating metamemory judgements by temporal focus, retrospective metamemory
activated bilateral parahippocampal cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus,
whereas prospective metamemory activated posterior mPFC, left dorsolateral PFC,
and right insula. Observing parahippocampal cortex activation for retrospective
metamemory and PFC activation for prospective metamemory is consistent with
elements of both direct access and inferential accounts of how metacognitive
judgements about memory are formed (Metcalfe and Dunlosky, 2008). On one
hand, fMRI activation and single-unit responses in the MTL have been linked not
only to objective recognition performance (Kao et al., 2005) but also memory
confidence (Rutishauser et
al., 2015), and feelings of familiarity (Haskins et al., 2008; Henson et al., 2003;
Montaldi et al.,
2006), consistent with a first-order contribution of mnemonic
representations to metacognitive judgement. In contrast, medial prefrontal
activation covaries with JOLs independently of first-order performance (Kao et al., 2005) and
PFC lesions impair JOL accuracy but not performance (Schnyer et al., 2004), potentially
consistent with an inferential basis for prospective confidence.

Comparing metacognition and mentalising
An appealing model is that metacognition and ToM share a common computational
basis that involves recursive inference about our own and others’ mental states.
Neural processes supporting ToM are typically assessed by asking subjects to
read stories that describe a character’s true or false beliefs while undergoing
functional brain imaging (Saxe et al., 2006). These studies have led to the identification of
a network encompassing dorsomedial PFC, TPJ, and precuneus as involved in ToM
(Amodio and Frith,
2006; Frith and
Frith, 1999; Molenberghs et al., 2016; Schurz et al., 2014). However, despite
surface similarities in activation location (e.g. precuneus), up until recently,
the overlap between large-scale brain networks involved in metacognition and ToM
has remained unclear. A notable exception is a study by Valk et al. (2016), who analysed
individual differences in cortical thickness and white matter anisotropy related
to metacognitive sensitivity on perceptual and higher-order cognitive tasks. It
was found that medial prefrontal regions, in which cortical thickness predicted
metacognitive ability, overlapped with those from neuroimaging meta-analyses of
mentalising.

Here, we assess overlap between our composite meta-analysis of
metacognition-related activations and a meta-analysis of mentalising obtained
from Neurosynth. While a similar midline network was engaged in both cases,
there was in fact minimal overlap between the maps in posterior mPFC and
precuneus; instead, metacognition engaged more dorsal and posterior regions.
However, overlap was observed in ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial PFC.
vmPFC has been specifically associated with self-reflective processing (D’Argembeau et al.,
2007; Jenkins and
Mitchell, 2011), and its role in ToM tasks is thought to support a
simulation of what oneself would do in another’s situation (Jenkins et al., 2008).
Intriguingly, in contrast, anterior dorsomedial PFC has been suggested to
support second-order representations of mental states, irrespective of whether
they originate from self or other (Nicolle et al., 2012; Yoshida et al., 2010).
Unique activations for metacognition were observed in insula and lateral PFC,
perhaps reflecting the specific contribution of interoception/error monitoring
and the formation of confidence estimates, respectively, during self-directed
judgements. ToM, in contrast, was uniquely associated with activations in TPJ
and temporal pole, consistent with previous findings that these regions are
biased towards other-referential processing (Saxe et al., 2006).

These data may tentatively speak to the difference between conceptual and
non-conceptual forms of metacognition (Arango-Muñoz, 2011; Proust, 2013). It is
plausible that a subset of the unique regions associated with metacognition here
(e.g. posterior mPFC and insula) mediate non-conceptual, lower-level epistemic
feelings of uncertainty. This perspective is consistent with these regions being
found in our parametric confidence meta-analysis activations (Figure 2). In contrast,
mPFC may support a conceptual second-order representation of one’s own mental
states (conscious elaboration of epistemic feelings) and, in doing so, co-opt
similar neural machinery to that engaged when reflecting on or inferring the
mental states of others (Carruthers, 2009, 2011; Lombardo et al., 2010). A strong test
of this hypothesis would be to compare neural correlates of explicit and
implicit measures of self-directed metacognition (Logan and Crump, 2010) with activity
engaged when mentalising about others. We would predict that only variation in
explicit metacognitive judgements would share commonalities with ToM. However,
it is also likely that differences in content between typical ToM and
metacognition studies may drive the differences observed here (e.g. judging
another person’s emotions or social intentions vs judging one’s own cognitive or
decision processes). Further within-subject studies are needed with matched task
domain/stimulus materials to draw strong conclusions about the relation between
the neural substrates of self- and other-directed metacognition.

Implications of domain-specific differences in metacognition for
neuropsychiatry
One implication of domain-specific neural correlates of metacognition is that
damage or disorder affecting these regions may help explain the various types of
introspective deficits observed in neuropsychiatry (David et al., 2014). The level of
insight into one’s symptoms in schizophrenia have been linked to metacognitive
ability over and above differences in executive function (Gilleen et al., 2016), and previous
studies of lack of insight have highlighted similar regions to those identified
here, including mPFC (van
der Meer et al., 2013), insula (Spalletta et al., 2014), inferior
frontal gyrus (Orfei et al.,
2012), and dorsolateral PFC (Shad, 2004). Individuals with
addictions, and those in remission from addiction, have been found to have
deficits in metacognition which were predicted by loss of structural integrity
in mPFC (Moeller et al.,
2016). Furthermore, change in mPFC function has been found to predict
the severity and prognosis of addictions (Moeller and Goldstein, 2014).

Neurodegenerative disorders have also been known to bring about progressive
anosognosia, or symptom unawareness (García-Cordero et al., 2016).
Specifically, Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with metamemory deficits
independent of memory deficits, with various studies finding both better and
worse insight relative to performance (McGlynn and Kaszniak, 1991; Moulin et al., 2003;
Souchay, 2007).
The parahippocampal cortex, found in our meta-analysis of retrospective
metamemory, is known to be one of the earliest affected regions in the typical
progression of Alzheimer’s, potentially consistent with behavioural observations
of metamemory deficits (Cosentino, 2014; Didic et al., 2011).

Analysis limitations
Our study represents a first attempt to consolidate and synthesise findings in
the neuroimaging literature on metacognitive judgements and is accompanied by
several limitations. First, coordinate-based meta-analyses inevitably sacrifice
experimental control to allow aggregating over studies. We were unable to
balance the types of tasks (e.g. visual and semantic) used most frequently in
different domains, and such imbalances may affect our results. For instance,
metadecision studies are typically conducted using visual perceptual tasks,
which may bias our results towards this modality. Related to this, most studies
in our corpus only examined one particular domain. Because of this, and
prominent differences between metamemory and metadecision tasks (i.e. stimulus
type), it is not possible to estimate the extent to which differences between
domains are related to differences in task. Inferences on parameteric confidence
level–related activations are also limited by not incorporating the
directionality (e.g. high >low confidence) of the contrast. Second, our
analyses collapse across many different judgement types (e.g. FOKs, confidence
ratings, and JOLs) that may affect our results if each judgement relies on
different processes (Chua et
al., 2009; Leonesio and Nelson, 1990; Metcalfe and Dunlosky, 2008). Notably,
in metadecision, all judgements were retrospective, so we are unable to assess
whether temporality may differentiate metacognitive judgements more generally,
or only within metamemory judgements. Finally, all contrasts in our study were
univariate, whereas domain-specific differences in confidence-related activation
have recently been associated with multivariate patterns of activation in PFC
(Morales et al.,
2018).

Conclusion
Despite metacognition occupying a central role in human cognition, the relevant
neurocognitive architecture has remained underdetermined, partly due to
study-specific differences in both domain and type of metacognitive judgement under
study. We used quantitative ALE methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging
studies on metacognition, divided into categories based on the target of
metacognitive evaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type, and, for
metamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and retrospective). We find
engagement of mPFC and lateral PFC, precuneus, and insula in tracking the level of
confidence in self-performance of both decision-making and memory tasks, suggesting
domain-general contributions to metacognitive judgements. We find, however,
preferential engagement of parahippocampal cortex in metamemory experiments and
right anterior dorsolateral PFC in metadecision experiments. Finally, by comparing
our results to comparable analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common
engagement of the ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial PFC in metacognition and
mentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order representations
for thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others.
