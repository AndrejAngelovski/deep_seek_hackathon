Pyrazolines show different biological activities. In recent years, interest in the chemistry of hydrazonoyl halides has been renewed. 1,3,4-Thiadiazoles are one of the most common heterocyclic pharmacophores with a wide range of biological activities.

Results
Ethyl 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methyl-thiazole-5-carboxylate, 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazol-4(5H)-one, and 1-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)ethan-1-one were synthesized from the reaction of 5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide with different halogenated compounds. Thiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole and pyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives were also synthesized. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were elucidated based on elemental analysis, spectral data, and alternative synthetic routes whenever possible. Additionally, the newly synthesized compounds were screened for antimicrobial activity against various microorganisms.

Conclusions
A new series of novel functionalized 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3-thiazoles, and pyrazoline-containing moieties were synthesized using hydrazonoyl halides as precursors and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial, and antifungal activities. The antimicrobial results of the examined compounds revealed promising results and some derivatives have activities similar to the references used.

Introduction
Pyrazolines show a variety of biological activities. They are antimicrobial [1–4], antifungal [5], anti-depressant [6], immunosuppressive [7], anticonvulsant [8–10], anti-tumor [11], anti-amoebic [12], antibacterial [13], anti-inflammatory [14], anticancer [15], and MAO inhibitory activity [16]. Hydrazonoyl halides have been widely used as reagents for the synthesis of various heterocyclic compounds [17, 18]. Thiazoles are used in drugs developed for the treatment of allergies [19], hypertension [20], inflammation [21], schizophrenia [22], bacterial infections [23], HIV [24], sleep disorders [25] and more recently, for the treatment of pain [26]. They are also used as fibrinogen receptor antagonists with antithrombotic activity [27], and as new inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase B [28]. Moreover, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles are among the most common heterocyclic pharmacophores. They display a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antimicrobial [29], anticancer [30, 31], antioxidant [32], anti-depressant [33], anticonvulsant [34, 35] and antihypertensive activities [36], as well as acetyl cholinesterase inhibition for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease [37, 38]. In continuation of the author’s research work [39–45], the synthesis of some new thiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and pyrano[2,3-d]thiazole from 5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide are reported herein.

Results and discussion
The reaction of 5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide (1) with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, ethyl 2-chloroacetate or 3-chloropentane-2,4-dione in ethanol containing an amount of triethylamine afforded ethyl 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carboxylate (2), 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazol-4(5H)-one (3) and 1-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)ethan-1-one (4), respectively (Scheme 1).Scheme 1 Synthesis of compounds (2–4)




The structures of the compounds (2–4) were clarified by elemental analyses, FTIR, MS, NMR spectra and chemical transformation. Compound (2) reacted with hydrazine hydrate to afford 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbohydrazide (5) (Scheme 2). The structure of compound (5) was elucidated by elemental analyses, spectral data, and chemical transformations. Compound (5) reacted with nitrous acid, potassium thiocyanate, 3-(2-arylhydrazono)pentane-2,4-dione (8a and 8b) or ethyl 2-(2-arylhydrazono)-3-oxobutanoate (9a and 9b) to afford the following: 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl azide (6), 2-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (7), (3,5-dimethyl-4-(phenyldiazenyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)methanone (10a), (3,5-dimethyl-4-(p-tolyldiazenyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)methanone (10b), 2-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl)-5-methyl-4-(2-phenylhydrazono)-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one (11a) and 2-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl)-5-methyl-4-(2-(p-tolyl)hydrazono)-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one (11b), respectively (Scheme 2). The structures of compounds (6, 7, 10a and 10b) and (11a and 11b) were confirmed by elemental analyses, spectral data and chemical transformations whenever possible.Scheme 2 Synthesis of compounds (6, 7, 10a, 10b, 11a and 11b)




Treatment of 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl azide (6) with aniline, 4-toluidine or anthranilic acid in boiling dioxane gave1-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-3-phenylurea (12a), 1-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)urea (12b) and 3-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (13), respectively. Also, compound (6) reacted with 2-naphthol in boiling benzene to afford naphthalen-2-yl(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carboxylate (14) (Scheme 3). The structures of compounds (12–14) were confirmed by elemental analyses, spectral data and an alternative synthetic route. Thus, compound (6) reacted with methyl anthranilate in dioxane to afford a product identical in all aspects (mp, mixed mp and spectra) to compound (13).Scheme 3 Synthesis of compounds (12–14)




Next, treatment of 2-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (7) with sodium hydroxide yielded 5-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiol (15). The latter reacted with the appropriate hydrazonoyl halides (16a–d) in refluxing chloroform in the presence of triethylamine to give N’-(5-substituted-3-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)-2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbohydrazide (20a–d). The mechanism outlined in Scheme 4 seemed to be the most plausible pathway for the formation of (20) from the reaction of (15) or (15a) with (16) by two possible pathways. The first pathway was via 1,3-addition of the thiol tautomer (15) to the nitrilimine (19a–d) (which produced in situ from the reaction of hydrazonoyl halide [16a–d] with triethylamine) to give the thiohydrazonate ester (17) that underwent nucleophilic cyclization to yield spiro compound (18). The latter underwent ring opening and cyclization to yield (20). The second pathway was via 1,3-cycloaddition of nitrilimine (19) to the C=S double bond of (15a) to give (18) directly (Scheme 4). Attempts to isolate the thiohydrazonate ester (17) or the intermediate (18) did not succeed, even under mild conditions, as these two compounds readily underwent in situ cyclization to give the final isolable product (20), as shown in Scheme 4.Scheme 4 Synthesis of compounds (15) and (20a–d)




Treatment of 2-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (7) with the appropriate hydrazonoyl halides (16b) and (16c) in ethanolic triethylamine afforded 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methyl-N’-(4-methyl-5-(phenyldiazenyl)-thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (21a) and 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methyl-N’-(4-phenyl-5-(phenyldiazenyl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (21b), respectively (Scheme 5). The structures of compounds (21a and 21b) were confirmed by elemental analyses and spectral data.Scheme 5 Synthesis of compounds (21a and 21b)




On the other hand, the treatment of compound (5) with maleic anhydride and phthalic anhydride afforded 1-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl)-1,2-dihydropyridazine-3,6-dione (22) and 2-(2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole-5-carbonyl)-2,3-dihydro-phthalazine-1,4-dione (23), respectively (Scheme 6). The structures of compounds (22) and (23) were elucidated by elemental analyses and spectral data (cf. Experimental).Scheme 6 Synthesis of compounds (22) and (23)




Finally, treatment of 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazol-4(5H)-one (3) with arylidenemalononitriles (24a–c) in boiling ethanol containing a catalytic amount of piperidine afforded 5-amino-2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-7-aryl-7H-pyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-6-carbonitrile (25a–c). The structures of compounds (25a–c) were elucidated by elemental analyses, spectral data and a synthetic route. Thus, the infrared (IR) spectrum of compound (25a) showed bands at 3388 and 3175 cm−1, which corresponded to the NH2 group. Furthermore, a mixture of malononitrile, an appropriate aldehyde and 2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazol-4(5H)-one (3) in ethanol containing a few drops of piperidine as a catalyst was heated under reflux to afford products identical in all aspects (mp, mixed mp and spectra) with (25a–c), respectively (Scheme 7).Scheme 7 Synthesis of compounds (25a–c)



Antimicrobial activity
For their in vitro antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pneumonia and Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, twenty-one of the newly synthesized target compounds were assessed. They were also assessed against a representative panel of fungal strains for their in vitro antifungal activity (i.e., Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans). Ampicillin and gentamicin for in vitro antibacterial activity were used as reference drugs; While Amphotericin B was used for in vitro antifungal activity as a reference drug. Examinations were conducted at Al-Azhar University’s Regional Center for Mycology and Biotechnology (Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt). Microbes were obtained from the Microbiological Resource Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.

Experimental
General information
An electrothermal device (Bibby Sci. Lim. Stone, Staffordshire, UK) has been used to determine all melting points and they are uncorrected. A FT—IR 8201 PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) was used to determine the IR spectra. On Varian Mercury VX-300 NMR spectrometer (Varian, Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany) operating at 300 MHz (1H NMR), the 1H-NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 solutions. The chemical shifts are expressed in δ ppm units using TMS as an internal reference. On a Shimadzu GC–MS QP1000 EX instrument (Tokyo, Japan) mass spectra were recorded. Elemental analyses were performed at the University of Cairo’s Microanalytical Center. As previously reported, hydrazonoyl halides [46–49] and 5-(furan-2-yl)-3-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide [39] Additional file 1: Figure S1 were prepared.

Antimicrobial activity assay
The chemical compounds being investigated were tested against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens and fungi individually. Antimicrobial tests were performed using the agar well-diffusion method [50–52]. After cooling and solidifying the media, In the solidified agar, wells (6 mm in diameter) were made, the microbial inoculum was then spread evenly using a sterile cotton swab on a sterile Petri dish containing a medium of nutrient agar (NA) or Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) media for bacteria and fungi, respectively. By dissolving 1 mg of the compound in 1 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) a 100-µL of aliquot of the tested compound solution was prepared. The inoculated plates were then incubated for bacteria and yeast for 24 h at 37 °C and fungi for 48 h at 28 °C. In order to dissolve the tested compound, the negative controls were prepared using DMSO. Amphotericin B (1 mg/mL), Ampicillin (1 mg/mL) and Gentamicin (1 mg/mL) have been used as bacterial and fungal standards, respectively. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated after incubation by measuring the inhibition zone against the microorganisms tested. Antimicrobial activity has been expressed in millimeters (mm) as inhibition diameter zones.
