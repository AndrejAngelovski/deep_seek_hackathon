Summary points
The current United States opioid overdose crisis is a complex,
multifaceted, public health emergency that urgently requires the
implementation of evidence-based primary, secondary, and tertiary
preventive interventions. We develop a typology of the stigma related to
opioid use, showing how multiple dimensions of stigma continue to
fundamentally hinder the response to the crisis.

Public stigma is driven by stereotypes about people with opioid use
disorders, such as their perceived dangerousness or perceived moral
failings, which translate into negative attitudes toward people with
opioid use disorders.

Enacted stigma describes the behavioral manifestations of public stigma,
including discrimination and social distancing. Public and enacted
stigma, in turn, lead to delivery of suboptimal care and undermine
access to treatment and harm reduction services.

Public stigma and enacted stigma can become structural stigma when they
become encoded in cultural norms, laws, and institutional policies.
Collectively, these forms of stigma run at cross purposes to—and reduce
public support for—public health–oriented policies to address the opioid
overdose crisis.

When people with opioid use disorders internalize or anticipate the
public stigma attached to their illness, maladaptive behaviors (e.g.,
disengagement from care) leading to poorer health outcomes may
occur.

Each of these dimensions of stigma (structural, public, enacted,
internalized, and anticipated) serve to reinforce each other, resulting
in poorer health outcomes even as the epidemiology of opioid overdose
mortality continues to change.

These dimensions of stigma must be overcome to facilitate the requisite
policy and programmatic changes needed to effectively address the opioid
overdose crisis.

Introduction
The current US opioid overdose crisis is a public health emergency. The age-adjusted
mortality rate due to drug overdose more than tripled from 1999 to 2017 [1]. In recent years, the
largest increases in drug overdose mortality were observed for drug overdose deaths
involving nonpharmaceutical fentanyl, which increased by an average of 71% per year
in 2013–2017 [1–4], whereas overdose deaths
involving prescription opioids and heroin have remained steady [5]. Concomitant with the rapid
expansion in the magnitude of the opioid overdose crisis is an expansion in its
scope, with increasingly syndemic [6] involvement of cocaine and psychostimulants [7–10].

There are multiple, interrelated, and deeply rooted social and economic determinants
of the US opioid overdose crisis, none of which are likely to provide a sufficient
explanation for the crisis when considered in isolation [11–17]. Although the epidemiology of opioid use
and opioid use disorders (OUDs) has changed over time, the stigma attached to opioid
use has endured [18]. Stigma
is defined as a process wherein people with a particular social identity are
labeled, stereotyped, and devalued, unfolding within the context of unequal and
often preexisting power relations, leading to discriminatory behavior against people
with the stigmatized identity [19–21]
(Box
1). Its persistence and its persistent effects on health are
consistent with its conceptualization as a “fundamental cause” of population health
inequities across multiple social and physical health outcomes [22,23]. In the following discussion, we describe
how these multiple dimensions of stigma are a fundamental hindrance to the response
to the US opioid crisis.

Box 1. Typology of the stigma related to opioid use.
Public stigma [24] is driven by stereotypes about people with OUDs
[18],
such as their perceived dangerousness [25,26] or perceived moral failings
[27],
which translate into negative attitudes.

Anticipated stigma occurs when people with a stigmatized identity are
subjectively aware of such negative attitudes and develop
expectations of being rejected were their stigmatized (and
potentially hidden) identities to become known [28]. Among
people who do not have the stigmatized identity, perceived stigma
refers to subjective awareness of negative attitudes and
expectations of rejection were a hypothetical stigmatized identity
to become known.

Internalized stigma results when people with a stigmatized identity
come to accept their devalued status as valid, thereby adopting for
themselves the prevailing negative attitudes embedded in public
stigma [29,30].

Enacted stigma describes the behavioral manifestations of public
stigma, including discrimination and social distancing [31,32].

Family members and friends may experience all of these forms of
stigma as a result of their affiliation with people with OUDs, a
phenomenon described as courtesy stigma [21].

Structural stigma refers to the totality of ways in which societies
constrain those with stigmatized identities through mutually
reinforcing institutions, norms, policies, and resources [33–36].

The US opioid overdose crisis response: Multiple levels of prevention
needed
Given the complexity of the US opioid overdose crisis, an effective response will
require a multicomponent portfolio of public health, social, and economic policy
interventions to address its social and structural determinants [11–17]. Health system interventions will also be
necessary to implement primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of opioid
overdoses [37]. First,
exposure to opioid use among opioid-naive patients should be minimized (primary
prevention). Second, among those exposed to opioids, nonmedical use of prescription
opioids and the incidence of OUDs must be reduced (secondary prevention). Third,
expanded evidence-based treatment for OUDs is needed so that people with existing
OUDs can achieve sustained remission, while the harms of ongoing opioid use (e.g.,
overdose) must be reduced for people who cannot, or do not choose to, achieve
sustained remission (tertiary prevention). In combination, these preventive
interventions will address what Humphreys and Pollack [38] have referred to as the “stock” and “flow”
of the crisis: treatment and harm reduction for people already diagnosed with OUDs
while simultaneously reducing the number of people with new diagnoses.

One component of primary and secondary prevention is promoting cautious and
thoughtful opioid prescribing. People who are exposed to opioids—including
prescribed opioids—are at increased risk of long-term use and of developing OUDs
[39–41]. Surveys of people with OUDs often identify
prescription opioids as the initiating opioid [42]. Thus, the importance of the admonition to
“keep opioid-naive patients opioid naive” (p. 1454) [43] cannot be overstated. Other strategies to
support primary and secondary prevention have been discussed extensively: reducing
incautious and long-term opioid prescribing; preventing diversion; and identifying
patients who may be at risk for, or who have already developed, OUDs [44–46].

Given current trends, however, prescribing-focused interventions alone will be
insufficient to address the crisis. Opioid prescribing has already been in a nearly
decade-long decline [47–49]. There is also evidence
that the incidence of initial opioid prescriptions for opioid-naive patients has
declined [50]. Despite these
favorable trends, drug overdose mortality has continued to increase [1], with nonpharmaceutical
fentanyl and its analogues increasingly associated with drug overdose deaths [1–5]. Thus, a singular focus on physician
prescribing of opioids, to the exclusion of other prevention efforts, is unlikely to
improve outcomes for those engaging in nonmedical use of opioids (e.g.,
nonpharmaceutical fentanyl) [51,52].

Tertiary prevention should focus on expanding evidence-based treatment of OUDs and
reducing the harms of ongoing opioid use. Gold-standard, first-line treatment of
OUDs consists of opioid agonist medication (methadone) or partial agonist medication
(buprenorphine) [53].
Psychosocial interventions can also be effective when offered in conjunction with
medication [54]. Yet only a
minority of people with OUDs receive treatment of any kind, even after nonfatal
overdose [55,56]. This underuse represents a
missed public health opportunity, given the well-established effectiveness of opioid
agonist treatment in reducing mortality [55,57]. Evidence-based harm reduction strategies
for people with refractory OUDs include access to sterile injection equipment to
reduce secondary transmission of HIV and hepatitis C [58–60], supervised consumption facilities [61] and supervised treatment
with diacetylmorphine (heroin) [62] to reduce overdose risk, and expansion of overdose education and
naloxone distribution to reduce the case-fatality rate of opioid overdoses when they
do occur [63–65].

Stigma as a fundamental hindrance to the US opioid overdose crisis
response
Public and enacted stigma
Negative attitudes toward people with OUDs undermine secondary prevention
responses. People whose chronic noncancer pain syndromes have led to their
physiological dependence on prescription opioid medications may be marked with
the same labels as people with OUDs (e.g., morally weak, “addicts”) and
experience difficulties obtaining care [66,67]. Healthcare professionals’ stigmatizing
beliefs [68] can lead to
provision of suboptimal care, a form of enacted stigma that reduces patients’
engagement with drug treatment [69–71]. In
some instances, these suboptimal care patterns may extend to maintaining overly
rigid and nonbeneficent care policies, lacking respect for patient autonomy, and
deploying punitive care terminations in response to policy violations (e.g.,
smoking) or positive urine toxicology screening [66,70]. In the 3 years since the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention published its new opioid-prescribing
guideline [72], stigma
enactments have included the imposition of rigid dosage or duration caps or
initiation of noncollaborative tapers with established patients, escalating
potential harms and transition to nonprescription opioids [73–78]. Enacted stigma has also been directly
associated with nonfatal overdose [79].

Tertiary prevention is compromised when the stigma attached to OUDs affects
access to treatment and harm reduction services. Among physicians who have
obtained the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) waiver to prescribe buprenorphine
[80], most are not
prescribing at capacity [81–83]; of
these, many express little interest in taking on patients to reach capacity
[84]. This gap in
treatment access may reflect provider distancing from patients stereotyped as
“difficult,” dangerous, or being involved in criminalized behaviors [85,86]. Other providers may wish to avoid the
legal scrutiny associated with being a considered a “pill mill” (e.g., DEA
audits) [87] or to avoid
the courtesy stigma attached to caring for patients with OUDs [86,88]. Stigma has also undermined the wider
distribution of overdose education and naloxone in the community. Specific
challenges include anticipated stigma [89], concerns about moral hazard [90–92], or ignorance about state legislation
related to naloxone prescribing or dispensing [93,94]. Most states have passed “Good
Samaritan laws” to limit criminal liability for bystanders who provide or summon
aid when witnessing an overdose incident [95], but the street-level effectiveness of
such legislation may be limited by anemic implementation and punitive signaling
by criminal law and law enforcement, including high-profile “drug-induced
homicide” prosecutions, loss of housing, and other legal repercussions [96,97].

Structural stigma
Public and enacted stigma can become structural stigma when they become encoded
in cultural norms, laws, and institutional policies. The effects of structural
stigma on undermining treatment of OUDs can be observed in how care is financed
and delivered. Treatment is generally covered by state Medicaid programs [98], but prior
authorization requirements and arbitrary lifetime treatment limits impose
significant barriers to care [99–102], and
many physicians who have obtained the waiver to prescribe buprenorphine do not
accept third-party payments [103–105]. The
2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, among its many functions,
sought to transform substance use treatment financing and delivery by mandating
that effective treatments for substance use disorders be covered by third-party
payers and integrated into mainstream healthcare systems [106,107]. However, the Affordable Care Act
remains under threat, with attendant implications for the US opioid overdose
crisis response [108].
Even where treatment is covered, treatment availability is commonly undermined
by exclusionary zoning practices (that are themselves the product of public
stigma [109,110]), further eroding
engagement in care [111].
Concerns about treatment access are exacerbated in rural settings [112].

Other stigmatizing polices affect the health of people with OUDs in ways that are
unrelated to treatment. Laws criminalizing the possession and distribution of
certain substances codify stigma through both normative and instrumental
pathways [97]. Many
transplant centers consider OUDs, chronic opioid use, or opioid agonist
treatment to be a relative contraindication to proceeding with transplantation
[113–115]. Similarly, people
with a history of injection drug use, or people on opioid agonist treatment
(irrespective of injection drug use history), are routinely excluded from
receiving post-acute care in skilled nursing facilities [116] or parenteral antimicrobial therapy in
outpatient settings [117,118].
Physicians identified as having OUDs who are required to enroll in physician
health programs are often required to adhere to abstinence-only approaches and
discontinue opioid agonist treatment as a condition of maintaining professional
licensure [119]. Taken
together, these types of policies and related decision-making not only reinforce
the ways in which people with OUDs are treated separately from others but also
implicitly classify people with OUDs as being unworthy of investment and
undeserving of treatment—thereby potentially having direct effects on health
outcomes.

More generally, the language used to frame the crisis can influence norms about
OUDs and about people with OUDs among policymakers and their constituents,
directly affecting the policy levers that are brought to bear on the US opioid
overdose crisis response. Everyday use of stigmatizing language negatively
influences attributions of responsibility and increases support for punitive
judgments (e.g., “substance abuser” [120]) or devalues evidence-based treatment
of OUDs (e.g., “medication-assisted treatment” [121]). News coverage of the US opioid
overdose crisis has inadequately emphasized treatment [122,123] and has instead largely framed the
crisis as a criminal justice issue [124], particularly in ways that are
racially disparate [125].
The very use of the moniker “epidemic” to describe the overdose crisis invokes
isolation, quarantine, vector control, and other measures befitting infectious
disease control but that are poorly calibrated for responding to the
multifactorial opioid overdose crisis [97]. Language matters, because the
judicious use of frames can shift public stigma [122,123], which can then become encoded
structurally in the lack of public support for public health–oriented policies
to address the opioid overdose crisis [126–131].

Internalized and anticipated stigma
When people with OUDs internalize or anticipate the public stigma attached to
their illness, maladaptive behaviors leading to poorer health outcomes may occur
[132,133]. Among people with
OUDs, internalized stigma has been associated with psychological distress and
poorer quality of life [134–136],
continued substance use [137], and reduced engagement with substance use treatment [138]. Anticipated stigma
has also been associated with psychological distress [135,139] and reduced engagement in care [71,140–142]. In one nationally representative
study of patients attending Health Resources and Services Administration health
centers, stigma was one of the most commonly reported reasons for not engaging
in substance use treatment [143]. The effects of internalized and anticipated stigma on
treatment engagement can be especially pronounced in rural areas and small
communities where treatment providers and their staff have multiple or
overlapping relationships, thereby heightening concerns about boundary
violations or breaches of confidentiality [144].

For people with OUDs who do initiate treatment, continued adherence and retention
in care are needed to optimize outcomes. Longitudinal studies have consistently
found that long-term retention in buprenorphine treatment is poor, with only
one-third retained in care at 2 years [145–147]. No studies have directly linked
stigma to retention in care for opioid agonist treatment, but among persons with
other stigmatized conditions like HIV, stigma has been found to be a
consistently strong correlate of treatment adherence, retention in care, and
treatment outcomes [148,149].

Finally, the organization of treatment delivery itself can be stigmatizing to
patients. Opioid treatment programs providing methadone—and the supervision,
monitoring, and restrictive dispensing policies involved—are often experienced
as degrading and humiliating [150–154].
Patient preferences for buprenorphine over methadone are routinely couched in
terms of avoiding the stigma of methadone use [151,155]. These aspects of treatment delivery
are themselves a product of stigma (i.e., are informed by negative stereotypes
applied to people with OUDs) and are not necessary features of treatment itself
[152].

Considerations for health disparity populations
People with OUDs who are incarcerated or who have recently been released from
incarceration have a particularly urgent need for evidence-based treatment.
Detoxification during incarceration without linkage to treatment after release
increases the risk of overdose substantially [156–158]. However, few receive treatment during
incarceration or are linked to treatment after release [159–161]. This undertreatment of people with
OUDs who also have a history of involvement with the criminal justice system,
often motivated by stigma [162], represents a missed public health opportunity given the
well-established effectiveness of opioid agonist treatment in reducing
recidivism [163] and
mortality [164–166].

One of the most pernicious examples of the interactions between structural
stigma, public stigma, and enacted stigma can be observed in the racialized
drivers of the US opioid overdose crisis and of the policy and programmatic
response to the crisis. Because of racial disparities in receipt of opioid
analgesia to treat acute pain [167] and treatment discontinuation following aberrant urine
drug-test results [168],
blacks (compared with whites) were comparatively less affected by the “second
wave” of opioid-involved drug overdose deaths driven largely by the
natural/semisynthetic prescription opioids being readily prescribed by
physicians influenced by national clinical guidelines for assessment and
treatment of pain [15].
However, with increasing nonmedical use of prescription opioids and use of
nonprescription opioids among whites, news coverage about the opioid overdose
crisis in suburban or rural white communities often features sympathetic,
etiological narratives—whereas such accounts are typically missing in coverage
of the opioid overdose crisis among blacks and Latinos [125]. This selective stigmatization evokes
the racialization of crack cocaine, racially disparate federal prosecutions for
crack (versus powder) cocaine, and disproportionately harsh federal sentencing
of blacks that continue to have reverberating impacts in the present day [169,170]. The racialization of OUDs has
resulted in a treatment and prevention approach among blacks that is
characterized by overcriminalization and reliance on heavily regulated delivery
of opioid agonist treatment segregated from traditional healthcare systems
(i.e., daily dosing at community methadone clinics), whereas treatment and
prevention among whites has become increasingly medicalized and addressed
through office-based care [171,172]. In
recent years, the burden of the opioid overdose crisis has disproportionately
increased among blacks compared with whites [2]. Yet blacks receiving chronic
prescription opioid treatment are more likely than whites to experience dose
tapers [173],
buprenorphine treatment remains largely concentrated among whites and in areas
with higher proportions of white residents [174,175], and blacks who are able to access
treatment are less likely to be successfully retained in care [146].

Addressing stigma to support the US opioid overdose crisis response
The response to the US opioid overdose crisis urgently requires the
implementation of evidence-based primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.
The policy changes that are needed to support these interventions are well
understood and have been discussed extensively [80,176–178]. Yet the stigma attached to OUDs
remains a fundamental hindrance to the crisis response. Multiple dimensions of
stigma (structural, public, enacted, internalized, and anticipated) that are
rooted in intersecting social categories serve to reinforce each other,
resulting in poorer health outcomes even as the epidemiology of opioid overdose
mortality continues to change. Stigma influences everyday attitudes, agenda
setting, and policy-making. Stigma compromises the financing of care for OUDs,
shapes the distribution of access to care, and impinges upon care delivery.
Stigma even undermines the health of people with OUDs in ways that have nothing
to do with the treatment of OUDs.

What is less well understood is how the stigma-related barriers to these
requisite policy and programmatic changes can be overcome, either directly or
indirectly. Direct interventions to reduce public and enacted stigma may take
the form of persuasive communication or educational interventions—such as those
deployed through mass media campaigns, law enforcement training [179], or schools—designed
to improve understanding about the causes of and evidence-based treatments for
OUDs. However, the sustained, long-term impacts of such interventions on stigma
are unknown [180]. To
improve care within healthcare delivery settings specifically, direct
educational interventions may involve curricular changes at the level of
undergraduate [181],
graduate [182], or
continuing [183] medical
education. The specific educational content packaged within such interventions
should be selected carefully. Education about the biomedical foundation of OUDs,
for example, may not necessarily have the desired effects on stigma [184,185]. Contact interventions also hold
promise for stigma reduction [186], but, as with educational interventions, their long-term
effects remain unknown [187]. Finally, for people with OUDs, direct interventions to reduce
internalized and anticipated stigma might draw on approaches from cognitive
behavioral therapy [188]
or acceptance and commitment therapy [189].

Indirect interventions might target institutions instead of individuals. For
example, the mass media plays a central role in shaping our culture and
therefore may represent a critical lever for influencing how multiple levels of
stigma translate into specific behaviors and policies. Some print media
organizations have issued professional guidance about reducing the use of
stigmatizing frames in reporting about the opioid overdose crisis [190]. As another example,
the “Changing the Narrative” project at Northeastern University (https://www.changingthenarrative.news) aims
to reduce stigma and improve the accuracy of media portrayals, using various
strategies such as promotion of style guides, “detailing” to journalists and
editors, and social media monitoring and outreach. If disseminated nationally,
similar to the Australian government’s support of the Mindframe Media
and Mental Health Project [191], the impacts on public stigma could be
substantial [123,126,129,192,193]. Some academic journals [194,195] and academic societies [196] have adopted similar
guidelines. Broadcast media, rather than conditioning people to be fearful of
persons with OUDs [197],
can potentially reduce public stigma by portraying people with OUDs in ways that
provide viewers with insight into the structural factors surrounding their use
of opioids. However, as with print media, guidance on film and television
portrayals fall under the purview of multiple trade groups and companies, and
the levers for intervention are likely to be similarly diffuse.

The extent to which these direct or indirect interventions will successfully
translate into changes in structural stigma, including agenda setting and policy
change, remains unknown. Elected officials’ voting behavior and successful
policy enactment are contingent upon numerous factors [198–200], of which public stigma is only one.
Moreover, the systematic disenfranchisement of people with past criminal
convictions is one of the most spiteful barriers to policy reform, because it
strips voting rights from people whose behaviors were criminalized by the very
laws that they are now powerless to change [97]. Thus, there will remain a need for
civil society organizations and activist initiatives to have a central role in
influencing governmental responses to the overdose crisis. More research is
needed to understand the causal pathways through which stigma acts so that
interventions targeting these mechanisms can be deployed to enhance the opioid
overdose crisis response. Until the stigma of OUDs is addressed, it will
continue to hinder implementation of these interventions, exacerbating existing
population health inequalities.
