Functional capacity (FC) is a mediator between neuropsychological functions and
real-world functioning, but there is a lack of evidence of its correlation in
community-dwelling older adults. Objective: The study aim was to determine the
FC level of community-dwelling older adults using the UCSD Performance-based
Skills Assessment (UPSA) and to evaluate correlation with cognitive screening
tests. Methods: Senior center participants were selected according to inclusion
criteria: Portuguese fluency, age ≥60 years and self-reported independent
living. The subject exclusion criteria were: dementia or other DSM-5 diagnoses,
suicidal ideation or intent, non-completion of assessment battery, enrollment in
another psychosocial intervention or pharmacotherapy study. FC level was
determined by the UPSA, brief UPSA (UPSA-B) and Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living scale (IADL’s). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Memory of
Figure Test (MFT), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) were
used for cognitive assessment. A total of 35 subjects that had a mean age of 72
years, were predominantly females(88.6%) and had mean education level of 11.25
years were evaluated. Results: Mean UPSA and UPSA-B scores were 78.5 and 70,
respectively. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the
UPSA and IADL, MMSE and VFT. Conclusion: The UPSA serves as a screening
assessment of FC in community-dwelling older adults, showing a positive
correlation with cognitive screening tests.

RESUMO
Capacidade Funcional (CF) é um mediador entre as funções neuropsicológica e a
funcionalidade no mundo real, mas existe uma falta de evidências da sua
correlação em idosos vivendo em comunidade. Objetivo: O objetivo foi determinar
a CF de idosos da comunidade utilizando o UCSD Performance-based Skills
Assessment (UPSA) e avaliar sua correlação com testes de rastreio
cognitivo. Métodos: Participantes de casas de convivência foram selecionados
conforme critérios de inclusão: fluência no Português; 60 ou mais anos; auto
relato de independência. Critérios de exclusão foram: demência ou outro
diagnóstico do DSM-5; ideação suicida ou tentativa, não adesão a ao estudo;
envolvimento em estudo farmacológicos ou intervenção psicoterápica. A CF foi
determinado pelo UPSA, UPSA abreviado (UPSA-B) e escala Instrumental de
Atividade de Vida Diária (AIVD). O Mini-Exame do Estado Mental (MEEM), Teste de
Memória de Figuras (TMF), Teste de Fluência Verbal (TFV) e Teste do Desenho do
Relógio (TDR) foram utilizados no rastreio cognitivo. Um total de 35 sujeitos
com idade média de 72 anos, predominantemente do sexo feminino (88,6%) e
escolaridade média de 11,25 anos foram avaliados. Resultados: A pontuação média
do UPSA e UPSA-B foram 78,5 e 70, respectivamente. Uma correlação foi observada
entre o UPSA e AIVD, MEEM e TFV. Conclusão: O UPSA é um teste de rastreamento da
CF de idosos da comunidade apresentando correlação positiva com testes de
rastreio cognitivo.

==== Body
The world population is rapidly ageing with major consequences for health systems and
their workforce. In 2015, the world population over 60 years old numbered 900 million
and is set to reach a total of 2.1 billion in 2050.1 It is also expected that two-thirds of this population will be living in
low-income countries.2 The rapid increase in
non-communicable diseases such as dementia has a high economic burden. In 2015, a total
of 46.8 million cases of dementia were diagnosed worldwide with an estimated cost of 818
billion of dollars.3 Projections indicate that the
number of cases could double within just twenty years, affecting more than 90 million.
The early detection of cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older adults is still
a challenge in this field. The prevention of cognitive impairment may delay progression
to stages of high dependence, thus reducing the economic impact on the health
system.

Functional capacity (FC) is defined as the minimum set of abilities that are essential to
function independently in the community and is a known mediator between
neuropsychological ability and real-world functioning.4
-
6 Studies involving psychiatric patients have
demonstrated that global neuropsychological performance is related to performance across
multiple real-world functional domains, including participation in community activities,
interpersonal functioning, and work skills, though this relationship was largely
mediated by FC scores.7 These studies suggest that
patients with better overall neurocognitive skills are likely to have greater FC and
subsequent better outcomes. Since FC was adopted as a reference marker in psychiatric
conditions such as schizophrenia, improvement in FC outcome has been required as a
co-primary measure in clinical trials.8
,
9 FC measurements have also been required in
clinical trials involving Alzheimer’s disease(AD),10
,
11 as one of the treatment targets is to delay
the progression of AD to stages with higher levels of dependency. 

FC measurement techniques have strengths and weakness,12
,
13 particularly in community-dwelling
individuals. In general, these techniques are based on abilities/skills to function in
the real world such as communication skills and finance management. Most techniques have
focused on FC measurement via self-reporting, proxy ratings, clinician ratings, and/or
direct observation of patient’s behavior in their own environment. Self-reporting FC
scores may be affected by depression, lack of self-awareness, cognitive and emotional
functioning, and social judgments. Furthermore, functional scores based on a patient’s
behavior in an interview setting may not relate directly to capabilities in a range of
domains in the outside world. Proxy ratings may be unreliable, as they depend on the
observational ability and level of engagement of the informant. Clinician ratings are
often based on brief contact with the patient and focus on behaviors that may or may not
be related to the patient’s ability to function in the real world. Although assessment
of behaviors through direct observation of patients in their own environment during long
periods can provide representative data,it is likely to be extremely expensive and
labor-intensive. Performance-based assessment techniques have proven to be a viable
alternative when used in psychiatric patients living in the community, demonstrating
improvements in FC measurement.14


The UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA)13 directly assesses FC using standard role-playing to evaluate performance
in five domains: Comprehension and Planning (e.g., organizing trips), Finance (e.g.,
paying bills), Communication (e.g., using the telephone for an appointment),
Transportation (e.g., public transportation) and Household Chores (e.g., planning
shopping). The total scores range from 0 to 100 and the test takes about 30 minutes to
complete,though there are shorter versions of the UPSA based on 4 (UPSA-2) and 2
(UPSA-B) domains.7
,
15
,
16 The UPSA was originally developed in English
to evaluate schizophrenia patients living in the community. It was based on the
self-report Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) and had concordant validity
with the Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS) and
Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS).6
,
13 Since 2001 it has been culturally adapted to 8
different languages and employed in studies conducted in 17 countries.17 These studies involved FC measurement in a
variety of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Bipolar Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD.18
-
21 More recently, UPSA was also employed in
studies involving patients with HIV infection.22
A systematic review conducted by our group to identify the psychometric properties of
the UPSA17 extracted, summarized and analyzed
data from 41 studies involving 8,782 community-dwelling individuals. Although few
studies reported sensitivity and specificity, moderate-to-strong evidence of construct
validity and test-retest reliability was found. The UPSA showed good psychometric
properties in its shorter versions, including those with cultural adaptations. The UPSA
also strongly correlated with the WAIS-III, a cognitive battery based on classical
neuropsychological paradigms that has robust psychometric properties.23


Early detection of functional decline in community-dwelling older adults is still a
challenge, as they constitute an extremely heterogeneous population with many
confounding variables such as education and other lifestyle factors that may influence
cognitive reserve.24 The aim of this study was to
determinate the functional capacity level of community-dwelling older adults using the
UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA) and the UPSA-B and to evaluate their
correlation with cognitive screening instruments. 

METHODS
Sample selection
This study was part of a larger study involving participants of senior centers
administered by the city council of Rio de Janeiro25 and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee
(opinion no. 965.264). The selection process was based on an interview conducted
by a geriatrician of the research team according to the attendance capacity of
the two senior centers where the research was conducted. The inclusion criteria
were: Portuguese fluency, minimum age of 60 years and independent living
ability. These criteria were endorsed by the requirements for senior center use
(absence of a caregiver and regular frequency for their activities).
Participants were excluded based on the following criteria: diagnosis of
dementia or another DSM-5 diagnosis,26
suicidal ideation or intent, inability to complete the assessment battery
(sensory or motor impairment), and enrollment in another psychosocial
intervention and/or pharmacotherapy study. Participants that met the selection
criteria provided informed written consent for entry to the study. 

From a total of 40 interviewed subjects, 5 were excluded (refused to participate,
did not meet selection criteria or did not complete the research protocol). The
sample of 35 subjects comprised predominantly females (88%), individuals with a
mean age of 72.26 (SD=5.98) years and mean educational level of 11.26 (SD=4.63)
years. The mean number of chronic diseases was 2.71 (SD=1.40; ranging from 0 to
5), with a mean number of regularly used medications of 2.85 (SD=1.90; ranging
from 0 to 7). Table 1 summarizes the
sample characteristics.

Data collection
The subjects were evaluated in one session meeting of 60-90 minutes duration
conducted by a previously trained psychologist from the research team.
Demographic characteristics and health status information were collected from
the geriatrician’s interview during the selection process.

The UPSA13
,
27 and Instrumental Activity of Daily
Living (IADL)28 were employed to assess
FC measures. The UPSA-B16
,
27 scores were calculated according to
the communication and finance domains of the original version. 

The Brief Cognitive Screening Battery (BCSB)29
-
31 was employed to assess cognitive
measures. The BCSB instruments were applied in the following sequence:
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),32
,
33 Memory of Figure Test (MFT),29
,
34 Verbal Fluency Test - animals category
(VFT)35
,
36 and Clock Drawing Test (CDT).29
,
37
,
38 For this study, cut-off points were
adopted according to previous studies and sample characteristics (age and level
of education).39


Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS software version 22. Skewness and
kurtosis values were measured to assess the normality of the data distribution.
Kendall’s Tau-b, a non-parametric correlation analysis, was used to measure the
association between variables. Kendall’s Tau-b was preferred over Pearson’s
correlation due to the greater accuracy of Kendall’s hypothesis test in smaller
sample sizes.40


Hierarchical regression models were used to test associations between cognitive
tests and functional capacity, while controlling for demographic variables. A
two-step approach was used. On the first step sex, age and years of education
were entered as predictors into the model. The male category was the reference
for the sex variable. Age and years of education were measured as continuous
variables. The overall fit (F statistic) and explained variance
(adjusted R²) of the first step were registered. On the second step, the MFT
(episodic memory trial), CDT, VFT and MMSE scores were introduced into the
model. Changes in fit and explained variance from the first step to the second
step were reported, as well as the overall fit and explained variance of the
second step model. Both the UPSA and UPSA-B were used as dependent variables. As
regression is a parametric analysis, bootstrapped confidence intervals were used
to estimate the precision and significance of the predictors. 

The sample was divided into healthy and cognitively-impaired participants based
on performance on the MMSE. Performance was categorized based on previously
published data of 470 elderly residents of Rio de Janeiro on the BCSB,
stratified by years of education. Participants were categorized as ‘cognitively
impaired’ when their score on the MMSE was one or more standard deviations below
the mean. The Functional Capacity and IADL scores of the two groups were
compared with the Mann-Whitney U-test.

RESULTS

Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for
cognitive and functional capacity measures. Mean scores on cognitive tests are
similar to previously published data. A non-parametric estimate, Kendall’s Tau-b,
was employed to test variables with asymmetric distributions (Table 2). Age demonstrated negative correlation with the VFT,
UPSA total score, UPSA-B and UPSA Communication and Transportation domains. Level of
education correlated positively with the MMSE, VFT, CDT, UPSA total score, UPSA
Finance and Transportation domains and the UPSA-B. The second (incidental memory)
and fifth (episodic memory) steps of the MFT correlated positively with UPSA total
score, and UPSA Finances and Transportation domains. The UPSA and the UPSA-B showed
a positive moderate correlation with the MMSE, VFT, and CDT. The IADL correlated
positively with UPSA total score and UPSA Comprehension/Planning and Finances
domains.

Assessment Brief version

The first step of the regression model (age, sex and years of education)explained
39.9% of the variance of the UPSA total score (F (3, 31)=8.51,
p<0.01). Younger participants scored significantly higher on
the UPSA. Participants who spent more years in school also performed significantly
better on the UPSA. The women had a mean score that was 3.5 points lower than the
men, but this difference was not statistically significant (Table 3). The addition of the MFT, CDT, VFT and MMSE in the
second step of the regression improved the model quality (Fchange (4, 27)=3.30, p<0.05) and increased the explained
variance by 13.7%.The second step model explained, in total, 53.6% of variance
(F (7, 27)=6.61, p<0.01). Age remained a
statistically significant predictor, but years of education did not
(B=0.86, 95% CI [-0.22, 1.89], β=0.25). The VFT was negatively
associated with the UPSA total score, while all other cognitive variables were
positively associated with the UPSA (Table
3). The CDT was the strongest and only statistically significant cognitive
predictor (B=2.65, 95% CI [0.07, 5.24], β=0.37). The MMSE, MFT and
VFT were weakly correlated with the UPSA total score (Table 3).

Assessment Brief version

In relation to the UPSA-B, the first step of the regression explained 26.4% of
variance (F (3, 31)=5.07, p<0.01). Participants
with more years of education performed significantly better on the UPSA-B. Age was
not significantly related to the UPSA-B. The women had a mean score that was 1.13
points lower than the men, but this difference was not statistically significant.
The addition of cognitive variables in the second step of the regression
significantly increased model quality (Fchange (4, 27)=2.87, p<0.05) and explained an additional
14.3% of UPSA-B variance. The second step model explained, in total, 40.7% of UPSA-B
variance (F (7, 27)=4.33, p<0.01). Years of
education was no longer a significant predictor in the second step of the regression
(B=0.58, 95% CI [-0.99, 1.70], β=0.12). All cognitive variables
added on the second step were not statistically significant predictors, but were all
positively correlated with the UPSA-B.

A final analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U to test the difference in
functional capacity and IADL between cognitively-impaired and cognitively-normal
subjects. The group with low MMSE score had significantly lower UPSA
(U=32.00, p<0.05; effect size
r=0.34) and UPSA-B Total (U=32.50;
p<0.05; effect size r=0.34) scores.
However, the IADL scores did not differ significantly (U=56.50;
p=0.35; effect size r=0.16).

DISCUSSION
This study involved community-dwelling, highly educated older adults that were
regularly engaged in social and physical activities. The subjects had a mean of 2.71
chronic diseases, 2.85 medications and low rates of alcohol and tobacco use.
Previous studies demonstrated that, in 85% of cases, chronic diseases were the main
cause of disability in those over 60 years old.41
,
42 The relation between chronic disease and
health status was also explored in a study involving 504 older adults living in
their own home environment.43 The authors
observed that chronic disease negatively affected functional performance and
increased hospitalization rates, reducing independence in everyday functioning. In
the present study, the mean IADL score was 20 and mean UPSA and UPSA-B scores were
78.5 and 70.0, respectively, suggesting an independent profile for the study sample.
The subjects not only lived in their own environment, but also required little or no
supervision. Moreover, they did not have a family member nearby all the time and
some of them lived alone. 

The geriatric assessment was developed to attend a need for a specific approach to
the inpatient care of old adults.44
,
45 It has since been widely employed in a
variety of settings in an attempt to establish the individual’s health conditions
and develop specific, tailored care plans. FC is a relevant part of this assessment,
providing an evaluation of the individual’s ability to live independently in the
community. Nevertheless, FC assessment has been a challenge in community-dwelling
older adults. It involves the interaction of physical and cognitive abilities with
each other, as well as with the environment. In general, IADL is the gold-standard
instrument employed to determine the ability to interact with the environment. In
this study, an IADL score of 20 out of 21 (maximum score possible) was observed in
80% of the sample, suggesting a ceiling effect that was not seen in the UPSA.
Previous studies involving larger samples with Mild Cognitive Impairment and early
stages of Alzheimer disease also observed a discrepancy between UPSA and IADL
measurements.14
,
21 These findings suggested inability of the
IADL to identify functional capacity impairment in community-dwelling older
adults.

The detection of early stages of dementia in community-dwelling old adults is still a
challenge for many professionals.10 In
general, it requires the individual’s perception to report a decline in cognitive
abilities, the health professional’s experience and neuropsychological evaluation,
which is not always available. The cognitive screening tests are also affected by
educational level, requiring the adoption of different cut-off points according to
the individual’s characteristics.29
,
31
,
46 The variable presentation patterns and
speed of progression are also obstacles to the early detection of dementia. In
previous studies, the UPSA and UPSA-B also demonstrated a strong-to-moderate
convergent validity with cognitive measurements and known-group validity.17 As a screening tool, the UPSA-B has some
advantages in comparison to its original version, as it requires less time to
complete, almost no training, and uses accessible materials (a telephone, some notes
and coins).16
,
47 The psychometric properties and ease of
application of the UPSA-B as a screening tool could make it a useful instrument for
detecting early stages of dementia, independent of the individual’s characteristics
or professional experience of the interviewer, but more studies are necessary.

This study showed a stronger correlation between the UPSA and educational level than
between the UPSA and age. This finding can be partially explained by the hypothesis
of cognitive reserve that attributes higher cognitive abilities to education.24 The Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1936 evaluated
data from 1091 subjects and identified that longer schooling was a significant
predictor of higher scores on a latent general cognitive factor at age 70,
independently of childhood IQ score.48 The
study also identified that, although stimulating environments may help preserve
cognitive ability in later life, individual differences in prior cognitive ability
may also contribute to engagement in complex and intellectually stimulating
activities.49 In general, education
affects an individual’s ability to develop new strategies to manage the constraints
imposed by the ageing process. For example, a person can use a phone book more
frequently to look up telephone numbers that were previously known by heart when
confronted with a memory impairment. This discrete compensatory strategy will not be
noted,especially if this person is not engaged in labour activities that requires
some degree of productivity. One must also consider the effect of time interval on
the evolution of age-related changes and diseases in the acquisition of adapted
behaviours. All these factors can be obstacles in FC measurements based on
self-report and proxy rating.

In this study, some subjects had scores below the cut-off point for screening tests,
suggesting the presence of cognitive impairment. This aspect should be considered in
the overall approach used with senior center participants, when defining the
physical and cognitive stimuli applied as part of an active ageing program. A brief
systematic assessment, performed on a regular basis, would help detect the early
stages of cognitive impairment, as well as the heterogeneity in cognitive profile
for the senior center population. The observed differences in cognitive levels could
be used to support the design and adaptation of specific activities for the senior
center.

One limitation of this study was the small sample size. This aspect should be
considered before proposing wider generalization of the results to the Brazilian
population as a whole. Nevertheless, this initial study suggests greater UPSA
validity as an FC measure of community-dwelling older adults than the IADL. Further
investigations involving a more representative sample size could provide normative
data for the UPSA. It could also examine the UPSA predictive value for cognitive
impairment in older adults with high education. This investigation could provide
valuable information about the applicability of the UPSA as a screening tool for
health professionals.

In conclusion, the IADL questionnaire did not perform well in a sample of
community-dwelling older adults, as evidenced by its ceiling effect. By contrast,
the UPSA and UPSA-B detected a wider range of variation in functional capacity.
Additionally, the UPSA and UPSA-B showed a close relationship with cognitive
screening tests, even when age and education were controlled. For the screening of
functional impairment in this population, a performance-based evaluation seems to be
more adequate.

This study was conducted at the Psychology Department, Pontifícia Universidade
Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

We are grateful to the Senior Center staff for warmly welcoming our team and to all
the participants that kindly gave up their time for the sake of science.
