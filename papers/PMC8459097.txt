Smart phones are integral , especially within healthcare. However, there are increasing concerns regarding their contamination and potential infection control risk. Bacteria under selective pressure can rapidly acquire resistant mechanisms leading to the assumption; mobile phones used within clinical environment may harbour bacteria associated with a higher infection mortality rate.

Using next generation sequencing technology, characterise the true extent of bacterial contamination on mobile phones of hospital staff and determine the presence of multi-drug resistant bacteria associated with hospital acquired infections.

DNA was extracted from the swab tips of 450 Particpant’s mobile phones. 16S rRNA primers were used to characterise and compare the microbiome on devices from the hospital staff and a control group. Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis underwent Kirby Baur disc diffusion.

Results The microbiome revealed the extent of contamination far exceeds anything previously reported. In particular, gram-negative bacteria (including several important potential pathogens) were grossly under detected. 198 bacteria genus were discovered on mobile phones of which 34 were unique to the hospital. Differences were also detected between hospital departments. MRSA, VRSA and VRE were only detected within the hospital group.

Our results indicate traditional culture-dependent swabbing methods don’t provide an accurate account of mobile phone contamination. This may also be true in other areas relevant to infection control. Used within clinical environments could expose patients to unknown levels of multi drug resistant bacteria. Decontamination between patient contact should be a necessity to prevent the undermining of hand hygiene and the transmission of MDR bacteria.

Background

Phenotypic and genotypic diversity of vaginal bacteria Gardnerella vaginalis resulted in its classification into genotypic subgroups. The virulence potential of these subgroups was evaluated.

Methods

G. vaginalis clinical isolates were subtyped on the basis of subgroup-specific genes by PCR. The virulence-related phenotypic characteristics of the isolates were evaluated assessing their in vitro ability to grow as biofilm on abiotic surfaces, produce the toxin vaginolysin, and express sialidase activity. Vaginolysin in the supernatant of the cultures was quantified using toxin-specific antibodies by sandwich ELISA. Sialidase activity was tested using fluorogenic substrate. Cloning and expression of the sialidase gene of G. vaginalis in E. coli was performed. Differences in the expression of phenotypic properties of the isolates were evaluated by agglomerative hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis.

Results

Thirty-five clinical isolates of G. vaginalis were subtyped into three subgroups 1, 2 and 4. Analysis of sialidase activity indicated statistically significant differences among the subgroups. All isolates were grouped into three clusters by the methods of statistical analysis. The distinct profile of each cluster was based on the phenotypic characteristics of isolates. Subgroup 4 was the most homogenous group, as all isolates were found in the same cluster, which was characterized by the low production of all studied virulence factors. Subgroup 2 isolates were mainly distributed between two clusters, whereas subgroup 1 isolates were found in all three clusters.

Conclusion

G. vaginalis subgroups with different virulence potential might play distinct roles in vaginal microbiota.

An 85-year old lady originally from Gujurat presented to the emergency department with sudden onset left sided weakness and slurred speech. Stroke was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed bilateral multiple cortical and subcortical hypodense lesions; magnetic resonance imaging revealed that these lesions were ring enhancing with oedema. Lumbar puncture found an opening pressure of 22cm H2O, 98% lymphocytes (60x106/L) in the cerebrospinal fluid with a normal glucose (6.1mg/L) and high protein (0.66 mg/L). Cerebrospinal fluid culture, PCR and cytology were all negative. The patient was started on empirical therapy for tuberculous meningitis. A subsequent CT chest, abdomen and pelvis however did not find any other significant pathology.

Unfortunately, soon after her investigations, the woman rapidly deteriorated. A joint medical decision was made to shift focus of treatment to palliative care. After death, post-mortem found multiple irregular haemorrhagic solid lesions with dark brown edges. Histopathology confirmed extensive areas of necrosis, within which there were multiple amoebic trophozoites and cysts. A diagnosis of amoebic (it may be) meningo-encephalitis was made. These were thought to be free-living amoebae.

Free-living amoebae are ubiquitous to the environment, and exposure is common. The incidence of amoebic encephalitis however is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. Portal of entry, especially in cases where the cerebrospinal fluid protein is only mildly raised or normal, is thought to be through the nose or eyes (for example, Acanthamoeba keratitis from contact lenses). Clinicians should consider this as a differential diagnosis for any patient with multiple brain abscesses.

Background

Reported Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) ward rounds and review initiatives utilise consultant microbiologists or consultant ID physicians with or without senior antimicrobial pharmacists (AMP). There is sparse evidence regarding AMS ward rounds led by more junior members of staff.

Methods

AMS ward rounds were launched on the acute medical unit at Leicester Royal Infirmary, attended by a band 7 AMP and an Infectious Diseases registrar (ST3-5). Patient details and recommendations were recorded for each patient seen and followed-up to determine if recommendations were followed and the impact on treatment duration (TD), length of stay (LOS), and 28-day readmission rate (RR).

Results

104 patient reviews were recorded, of which 87% received at least one recommendation regarding their care (median 2, SD±1.4, Range 0-6), totalling 224 recommendations. Change of antimicrobial was advised for 35 patients (33.7%), whereas stopping antimicrobials was recommended for 18 patients (17.3%). Parenteral to enteral switch was recommended for 12.5% of patients. Although all contributions supported AMS, 41.2% also supported medicines optimisation. An alternative diagnosis was also suggested in 15 patients (14.4%).

All patients were followed-up. Ward clinicians changed treatment in line with recommendations in 70.6% of instances. There was no difference in TD, median LOS was 12-hours shorter for patients whose treatment was changed in line with recommendations, and RR was 9.5% lower for those whose treatment changed in line with recommendations.

Conclusion

Junior staff provide valuable input regarding patient care and optimising antimicrobial therapy. There was a trend towards shorter LOS and reduced RR.

Introduction Globally, C. trachomatis is the leading infectious cause of blindness. There is evidence to suggest that trachomatous inflammation may be linked to ocular infection with other pathogenic organisms.

Methods Conjunctival swab samples from 472 Tanzanian children who participated in a 4-year longitudinal study were analysed using optimised duplex qPCR assays to assess carriage of H. influenzae, CNS, S. pneumoniae and Adenovirus spp. in each sample. The presence of C. trachomatis (Ct) in the conjunctiva had previously been recorded. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex, was performed to identify associations between the prevalence of bacterial infection and (1) progressive scarring trachoma, and (2) active trachoma (defined as the presence of follicular trachoma (TF) or trachomatous inflammation (TI)).

Results Logistic regression identified no significant associations between (1) progressive scarring trachoma and Ct;and (2) progressive scarring trachoma and non-chlamydial bacterial infection. Active trachoma was only associated with conjunctival infection with H. influenzae. Logistic regression found that patients with ocular H. influenzae infection were more likely to demonstrate clinically-graded active trachoma (TF + TI) (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.11 – 3.56, p = 0.023). Individual analyses of TF or TI and their associations with H. influenzae found (1) a strong association between ocular H. influenzae infection and TF (OR = 2.21, p = 0.0095); (2) no association between ocular H. influenzae infection and TI (OR = 2.19, p = 0.19).

Conclusion These results indicate that H. influenzae might contribute to the TF phenotype. TF is widely used to assess population levels of trachoma.

Campylobacter lariis a rare cause of extraintestinal infection in humans. There has only been one prior case report of prosthetic joint infection in an immunocompetent adult, which was rapidly fatal. We can identify no previous case reports of successful management of this condition.

We discuss our management of a 63 year old stable manager that presented with 1 week history of right prosthetic knee pain and swelling. Following two washouts the patient underwent a first-stage revision of his knee. Post-operative antibiotic choice was empirical, and 28-day outcome has been promising, with complete resolution of inflammatory markers and resolution of symptoms. Outcome following planned second-stage revision will be discussed at FIS 2019.

Background

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme monitors the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms causing bacteraemias in the UK and Ireland. We review data for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteeae, and Serratia collected between 2007-2017.

Methods

Consecutive isolates causing clinically significant bacteraemia were tested; participating laboratories (n=24-40) collected 7-20 isolates/species per year. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined centrally by BSAC agar dilution.

Results

Rates of resistance in the UK and Ireland remained largely stable over the 11-year period, during which 14,206 isolates were tested [(E. coli, n=5364; Klebsiella, n=3016; Proteeae, n=2423; Enterobacter, n=1819, and Serratia, n=1584)]. A decrease in resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam was noted among all species, except K. aerogenes. A decrease in resistance to ciprofloxacin was seen among E. coli and Enterobacter. Average rates of resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam ranged from 0.2% (E. coli)to 9.2%(E. cloacae), whereas rates of resistance to ceftobiprole were higher [10% (E. coli) and 20% (E. cloacae)]. Rates of colistin resistance were low among E. coli (0.5%), and Klebsiella (1.2%); however, rates were higher, and increasing among Enterobacter (6.1% in 2011 to 13.4% in 2017). Rates of ESBL production were stable over time; higher among E. coli (9.6%), Enterobacter (10.4%), and Klebsiella (14.7%), compared with <1% among Proteeae and Serratia. Carbapenemase producers remained rare (n=16 over 11 years, without trend).

Conclusion

The largely unchanging or reducing resistance rates among Enterobacterales causing bacteraemia are reassuring and may reflect interventions to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials implemented across the countries surveyed.

Background.

Cefiderocol is a parenteral siderophore cephalosporin, with a catechol-containing 3’ side chain. We evaluated its activity against MDR Gram-negative bacteria

Methods.

MICs of cefiderocol, meropenem, ceftolozane-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime-avibactam, amikacin and colistin were determined in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth; the medium was iron depleted for cefiderocol only. The panel comprised 305 Enterobacterales, 111 P. aeruginosa and 99 A. baumannii selected for carbapenemases, ESBL production or carbapenem resistance via combinations of porin-loss with AmpC or ESBL.

Results.

The activity of cefiderocol was unrelated to Enterobacterales species. At 4mg/L cefiderocol inhibited 92.1% of all Enterobacterales, with rates of 95-100% for isolates with AmpC+porin-loss, VIM, IMP, OXA-48-like, KPC, GES, SME or IMI. Only isolates with NDM (72.1%) or ESBL+porin-loss (88.5%) had lower rates. No comparator agent inhibited >90% of isolates at EUCAST breakpoint.

Cefiderocol 4mg/L inhibited 86.5% of all P. aeruginosa, with rates of 80-100% for those with VIM, IMP, GES or VEB beta-lactamases. Lower rates were seen for those with NDM (72.7%) and PER (73.3%) enzymes. No comparator inhibited >85% of isolates at breakpoint.

Cefiderocol 4mg/L also inhibited 88.9% of A. baumannii isolates with rates >85% for those with OXA-51, -23, -24, or -58. A lower rate (80%) was seen for those with NDM carbapenemases. A concentration of 16mg/L was needed to inhibit ≥90% of A. baumannii.

Conclusions.

Cefiderocol was widely active at low concentrations against MDR Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. MICs for isolates with NDM enzymes nonetheless were higher than for those with other carbapenemases.

Background:

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is now recognised as the end point of a disease continuum. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) mark the presence of RA-related systemic autoimmunity, but the production of auto-antibodies alone is not sufficient to develop disease. Data on progression between the stages of RA disease are limited, but accumulating evidence suggests a microbial dysbiosis in the gut may trigger RA development. Using a prospective ‘at-risk’ cohort of ACPA positive individuals without arthritis, we investigated for the presence of a gut dysbiosis before the onset of RA.

Materials/methods:

Faecal samples from 25 ACPA-positive individuals, with non-specific musculoskeletal pain, were sequenced using16S rRNA gene. A control population was selected from publicly available data on the NCBI database, matched for rRNA V4 amplification region, sequencing technique, and approximately for age, gender, diet and ethnicity. Taxonomic analysis was performed using QIIME and MEGAN, and statistical analysis using R software.

Results:

Comparison of the ACPA-positive and control populations shows large clustering at bacterial family level. The ACPA population has an abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Helicobacteraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, and a lower abundance of Bacteroidaceae, Barnesiellaceae, Methanobacteriaceae amongst others. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa between the ACPA positive and control population was significantly different (P value 0.01, permutation MANOVA).

Conclusions:

The gut microbiome of individuals ‘at-risk’ of developing RA is distinct from heathy controls. These pilot data can inform further studies, and are an important step in the attribution of causality to the gut microbiome in the development of RA.

Background: Effective hand hygiene (HH) is fundamental to the prevention of healthcare-associated infections. One of the commonly used ways for assessing the effectiveness of HH procedure is measuring the extent of hand surface coverage with alcohol-based handrub (ABHR).

Methods: In this Latin square design study, handrubbing with ABHR was performed seven times by each of the 35 volunteers. Volunteers’ hands were contaminated with the Escherichia coli K12 strain as per EN 1500 guidelines. Glove juice samples were collected from their hands before and after each ABHR application and surface coverage was measured using Hand-in-Scan® scanner. The relationship between the bacterial log10 reduction and percent surface coverage was analysed using Spearman’s Rank Order Correlation and simple linear regression.

Results: Surface coverage ranged from 49.38% to 100% (N= 208, Mdn: 97,33%, IQR= 83.52 – 99.93), while the E. coli reduction ranged from 0.96 to 5.92 log10 (N= 221, M: 3.07, SD= 0.94). The Spearman’s Rank Order Correlation results showed no significant correlation between percent hand surface coverage and E. coli log10 reduction [r= -0.009, n= 198, p= 0.905]. The lack of correlation was further confirmed by the linear regression.

Conclusions: These findings suggest that the rate of surface coverage does not correlate with reduction in bacterial load on hands following HH. Although visual feedback on surface coverage can be a good approach to teaching the correct HH technique, these findings suggest that surface coverage alone is not a reliable measure of HH effectiveness.

Introduction:

Diarrhoea is a common presentation in travellers. This case highlights the importance of providing the microbiology laboratory with necessary clinical information so that special media can be inoculated in order to establish a prompt diagnosis.

Case Report:

A 29 year-old male was admitted in Glasgow, UK with a 24 hour history of profuse watery diarrhoea. He was travelling from Mumbai, India. He reported no relevant sick or healthcare contacts. On admission he was dehydrated, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Blood testing revealed normal electrolytes but lactic acidosis, a severe AKI, neutrophilia, and raised CRP. Treatment was initiated with IV fluids, empirical IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Urine, faeces and blood cultures were collected and rectal screening for CPE was performed. More than 6L of diarrhoea was passed in the first 12 hours.

Over the subsequent 48 hours diarrhoea continued while urine output and biochemistry normalised with IV fluids. Yellow colonies were grown from faecal cultures on TCSB agar. Gram stain revealed short, ‘comma-shaped’ gram negative aerobic rods. These were identified asVibrio choleraeusing MALDI-TOF and later confirmed to be serotype 01 El Tor. Rectal swabs returned positive for NDM-1 producing Escherichia coli. By the third day his diarrhoea resolved, antibiotics and IV fluids were discontinued and he was discharged.

Conclusion:

This case highlights the challenge of managing V. cholerae infection in a traveller. Cholera should be considered in the differential diagnosis of diarrhoea in any traveller and specific laboratory testing is required to make a positive diagnosis.

Background:

Guidelines recommend HIV testing in indicator conditions in which the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV exceeds 0.1%. We assessed adherence to national recommendations on HIV testing within the acute medical unit in NHS Fife. Secondly, we performed a look-back exercise to identify missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis in individuals who presented at a late stage of infection.

Methods:

Data were collected on admissions over a 24-hour-period during four consecutive weeks in 2018. Case records were reviewed and diagnoses were screened against a list of indicators. Additionally, data were obtained from HPS on late HIV diagnoses within NHS Fife from 2013-2018. Records were interrogated for presentations to healthcare services within the 5 years prior to HIV diagnosis.

Results:

In total, 226 patients were admitted during the study period. All patients were white, with median age 68yrs. 101 indicator conditions were identified, relating to 83 patients (36.7%). Bacterial pneumonia was the most frequently identified indicator (n=40). Only 3 patients were offered HIV testing (3.6%).

From 2013-2018, 23 patients were diagnosed with HIV at late stage. The median age at diagnosis was 41yrs and the median CD4 count was 161 cells/mm3. Fifteen patients (65.2%) had presented to hospital in the 5 years preceding diagnosis with an indicator. The most frequently missed indicator was chronic diarrhoea (n=6). Three patients (13%) have died since diagnosis.

Conclusions:

* Opportunities to increase uptake of HIV testing among people who may have undiagnosed HIV are being missed

* Further educational initiatives and review of local HIV testing protocols are indicated

How can a medical educational initiative address the evolving problem of vaccine hesitancy?

Background

Current surveillance data suggests that vaccine coverage rates (VCRs) in children are declining, potentially contributing towards outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases at levels not commonplace in the UK in recent years. This observed decline in VCRs can be attributed to a number of reasons, one of which is the increasing momentum in vaccine hesitancy.

Insights we have obtained from healthcare professionals (HCPs) demonstrated a paucity of accessible medical education specifically addressing this complex issue. This led Sanofi Pasteur to develop a contemporary, non-promotional ‘Vaccination Educational Initiative’ for HCPs, called Lumiere, part of which focuses on increasing vaccine confidence and addressing vaccine hesitancy.

Objective

Equip HCPs with evidence-based techniques which help them address the concerns of the public and improve vaccine confidence amongst patients.

Method

Five symposia were held across the UK. The faculty comprised both academic experts and specialist nurses with relevant clinical experience who presented proven techniques that can help increase vaccine confidence.

Attendee feedback from the first symposium suggested additional examples on how to apply these techniques in clinical practice would be helpful. Subsequent symposia were modified to include real life cases.

Summary of results

The symposia attracted a total of 443 attendees of which 37% (162) completed evaluation forms.

92% of respondents rated the symposia as good or excellent with 93% indicating they would change clinical practice based on their learnings.

From the initial roll out of Lumiere we have demonstrated that medical education can help support HCPs play an active role in restoring vaccine confidence.

Background

In the U.K., doxycycline is widely recommended as first-line empiric treatment for mild HAP, however this practice is based on expert opinion and we are aware of no data describing the outcomes of patients treated with doxycycline. Here we describe the outcomes of non-ICU patients treated empirically with doxycycline for low-severity HAP.

Methods

1680 inpatient chest x-rays were manually screened to identify cases of HAP. HAP was defined as new or progressive CXR consolidation occurring ³48 hours after admission, combined with compatible symptoms or signs. Treatment failure was defined as requirement for antimicrobial escalation, HAP recurrence or mortality attributed to HAP. We compared groups according to treatment outcome using the Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Results

Forty-nine patients who received doxycycline were included in the analysis. The median age was 78 years and 63% had >2 co-morbidities. Hypoxia was common (57%) but extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction was uncommon. 71% of patients were successfully treated with doxycycline as first-line empiric therapy. Treatment failure was associated with increased duration of hospitalisation prior to HAP onset (median 21.5 vs. 10 days, p=0.03) and higher neutrophil count (10.1 vs. 6.1 x109L-1, p=0.04). ROC analysis identified HAP onset >14 days after admission as the optimum cut-off for predicting treatment failure.

Conclusions

In this cohort, the majority of patients with low-severity HAP were successfully treated with doxycycline. Treatment failure was associated with prolonged hospitalisation prior to HAP onset with 14d identified as a potential surrogate marker for patients requiring antimicrobials against Gram-negative organisms.

Encouraging Day Three Reviews via a Pharmacist-led Antimicrobial Stewardship Ward Round

Background

Intravenous antibiotics should be reviewed at day three and a decision made whether to continue, stop, switch to oral or refer to OPAT. Clinicians struggle to undertake this review due to the demands of the daily ward round and patients are inappropriately left on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics, which can cause harm and increase antimicrobial resistance. A pharmacist-led virtual ward round was initiated to review these patients to decrease the number of patients on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and support regular review of these.

Methods

Patients on day three or more of intravenous antibiotics were identified using an electronic prescribing report and reviewed using an electronic antimicrobial review tool by a pharmacist on a weekly basis.

Recommendations were made via the tool and added to the patient’s electronic record and then followed up after 24 hours to review the prescription and identify whether advice had been followed.

Results

Over eight weeks, 75 patients had their IV antibiotics reviewed by the pharmacist. 20 recommendations were made to continue, 15 to stop, 33 for IVOS and 10 for OPAT referral. After 24 hours, 80% of patients were continued, 47% were stopped, 61% of patients were switched to oral, and 40% of patients were referred to OPAT as per the recommendations.

Discussion

The pharmacist-led virtual ward round appeared to have a positive impact on the reduction of IV antibiotics being continued after day three. Additionally, reviewing patients virtually allowed for more patients to be reviewed, increasing the impact of the stewardship round.

Introduction

Screening for carbapenem resistant organisms (CROs) enables early isolation and prevention of transmission in inpatient healthcare settings. In 2013, the UK Department of Health detailed a national approach to screening for CROs. Implementation of this policy has been variable and the growing numbers of patients who meet screening criteria likely exceeds capacity for isolation.

Method

We undertook a point prevalence study across two London hospitals to ascertain the frequency of per-policy screening. We assessed the screening of acutely admitted patients in March 2019 at hospital 1 and July 2019 at Hospital 2. We then modelled variations in screening approaches to optimise risk assessments in the context of isolation room availability.

Results

A total of 199 patients (112 patients at hospital 1 and 87 patients at hospital 2) were included in the analysis. Overall, 27/112 (24%) and 32/87 (37%) met the criteria for CRO screening according to current guidelines. Of these, 0/27 (0%) of patients at hospital 1 and 5/32 (16%) at hospital 2 had a CRO screen performed [p=0.06]. Across both hospitals, the principal risk factors for CRO carriage included: admission to a UK hospital in a high risk area (63/199;32%); admission to a non-UK hospital (3/199/;2%) and previous CRO carriage (1/199;0.5%) albeit with some variation between sites

Conclusion

Six years after the roll out of the national toolkit, CRO screening is still variable. Reworking of the risk stratification is needed, and we suggest technological approaches with electronic healthcare records may enable more robust screening strategies.

Background

Early diagnosis of HIV allows commencement of combination antiretroviral therapy, reducing morbidity and mortality, as well as transmission. In 2010, 64.3% of new patients diagnosed with HIV in Lanarkshire had missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis, leading to various educational initiatives. Their success in reducing missed opportunities is examined here.

Methods

People who were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2017 were identified. For each person, NHS Lanarkshire hospital records, dating back ten years, were analysed to identify missed opportunities for testing. These were defined as episodes of care with potential HIV indicator conditions (shown in the British HIV Association testing guideline), that did not lead to an HIV test. Comparisons were made to 2010 data.

Results

16 patients who were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2017 were identified. 43.8% (7/16) had missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis compared to 64.3% (9/14) in 2010. One presented with an AIDS-defining illness, compared with 3 in 2010. Blood dyscrasia was the most common clinical indicator that failed to prompt testing, although other commonly missed indicators were pneumonia and mononucleosis-like syndrome.

Conclusion

Educational initiatives are effective in improving appropriate HIV testing, however are not enough in isolation. Quality improvement strategies to increase testing, that are applicable to any Health Board/Trust, are currently being used. These include engagement with haematologists to provide testing prompts in reports, and opt-out testing in presumed high-prevalence clinical areas.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a chronic and debilitating condition that is estimated to affect 138 million women annually. In spite of this high prevalence and its associated economic burden, pathogenesis of disease is poorly understood. The biofilm-forming yeast Candida albicans is reported as the causative pathogen in up to 90% of VVC cases and around 50% in RVVC disease. Despite the identification of Candidabiofilms on the vaginal mucosa, their associated therapeutic challenge in RVVC is still disputed.

A panel of 100 HVS and cervico-vaginal lavage (CVL) samples were obtained for this trial. Patient questionnaires collected data on patient’s vaginal thrush history, treatments and any contraception currently used. Microbiological screening of clinical samples was performed, and microbiome analysis was utilized to determine predominant microbes present in each cohort.

Non-C. albicans species (NCAS) such as intrinsically azole-resistant C. glabrata were found to account for 27% of RVVC cases, notably higher than historically reported. Additionally, microbiome analysis showed a reduction in Lactobacillus species associated with a healthy microbiome in RVVC compared to health.

This study supports a previous clinical trial by our group using 300 HVS to investigate the epidemiology of RVVC showing an increasing prevalence of NCAS responsible for disease. Additionally, this work strengthens the hypothesis that formation of Candida biofilms on the vaginal mucosa could negatively impact clinical treatment. Further research to identify triggers for RVVC, and the pathogenesis of the predominant microbes involved, could considerably improve prevention and treatment options for women with recurrent, azole-resistant infections.

Biofilm infection is a challenging complication of implanted medical devices due to difficulties in delivering a concentrated dose of antimicrobial to the infection site. To prevent biofilm pathogenesis, a local drug-delivery method, such as drug-eluting technology using biodegradable polymers to coat implantable devices, may be favourable.

Implantable medical-grade polyester was coated in formulations of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and rifampicin (50:50, 60:40) and placed in PBS (37°C; 120rpm). To characterise release, media was collected periodically over 10 weeks and analysed (UV-spectrophotometry; 334nm). To examine biofilm inhibition, material was removed and submerged in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli suspensions (37°C; 24hrs) to stimulate biofilm formation. Biofilms were recovered using agitation/sonication, and enumerated.

Release data revealed that both formulations had an initial burst-release phase during the first 24 hours, releasing 92% (50:50) and 88% (60:40) of their respective rifampicin loads. For both formulations, this was followed by slow-release for the remainder of the examined time, reaching 98.9% (50:50) and 97.9% release (60:40). Despite a small fraction of loaded rifampicin remaining, the formulations were able to significantly inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation (up to 99%) for 10 weeks, and E. coli biofilm formation (up to 57%) for 6 weeks.

Drug-eluting polymer technology has already seen success in medical devices, such as coronary stents, to prevent restenosis. Here it has been indicated that this technology has potential in the field of infection prevention, by demonstrating the ability to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation to a significant degree for up to 10 weeks.

Background

Borrelia burgdorferi, the micro-organism responsible for Lyme borreliosis, is known to be endemic in Scotland, with 4.2% sero-prevalence in Scottish blood donors. Facial nerve palsy can be a manifestation of the illness. The aim was to establish how often Lyme is considered as a potential cause in one Scottish health board.

Methods

Patients, aged four and above, presenting to secondary care with facial nerve palsy from 2016-2018 were identified using ICD-10 codes. A retrospective analysis of case notes and laboratory records was undertaken to establish whether a cause for nerve palsy had been found, whether a potential tick exposure history was taken, and if Lyme testing had been done. Microsoft Excel was used for analysis.

Results

173 patients with confirmed facial nerve palsy were identified. Consideration of Lyme disease was made in 9.2% (16/173). Of these, 43.8% (7/16), were asked about possible insect bites (four of whom were asked specifically about tick bites). 43.8% (7/16) were tested based on clinical presentation. 6.3% (1/16) had “no Lyme risks” documented and another 6.3% (1/16) had an occupational risk. Of the sixteen, 50% (8/16) had Lyme serology undertaken, although 2/8 had a confirmed alternative cause.

Conclusion

Possibility of Lyme disease is not commonly considered when individuals present with facial nerve palsy. This is despite endemnicity in Scotland, and opportunities for tick exposure being common, with outdoor activities and countryside trips. Educational initiatives are therefore required.

A 74-year-old man with no previous history of tuberculosis presented with malaise, pyrexia (39°C) and 35kg weight loss, 16 months after TURBT for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and BCG instillation. He was pancytopaenic (Hb 84, Plt 99, WCC 2.94) and CT imaging showed splenomegaly, small pleural effusions and a sinusoidal lesion which on biopsy was not malignant. He did not have any promiment lymphadenopathy or pulmonary consolidation. Autoimmune and HIV screening were negative (CD4 310 (57%)) and both TTE and TOE showed no vegetations. IGRA/Quantiferon-Gold testing was positive and bone marrow biopsy yielded granuloma but no AFB on histology. Standard quadruple therapy was commenced for suspected disseminated mycobacterial disease. Mycobacterial cultures of early morning urine, blood and bone marrow were all positive and later identified as BCG on whole genome sequencing, sensitive to Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Amikacin and Moxifloxacin with undetermined Ethambutol sensitivity. Fully compliant with treatment, he developed a solid part cystic irregular enhancing 35mmmass encasing his left internal carotid artery seven months into treatment. ϒ-IFN-axis testing showed adequate responses to IL12 and IFN stimulation. Biopsy revealed AFB-positive granulomata leading to additional steroids for a presumed paradoxical reaction as well as treatment intensification with Moxifloxacin and Amikacin whilst awaiting cultures, the latter of which was discontinued following negative culture results and clinical and radiological improvement. Paradoxical reactions occur not infrequently (2-23%) and can present delayed (14-270 days) following initiation of treatment. He gained 25kg and made an uneventful recovery having received 18 months of BCG treatment.

Introduction

There is no routine screening for antenatal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) carriage in the UK. However where GBS is identified from clinical urine/vaginal samples, peri-partum antimicrobial therapy is advised. The changing pattern of antimicrobial resistance among GBS, particularly for macrolides/lincosamides, has implications for peri-partum antimicrobial for beta-lactam allergic patients.

Method

We undertook a retrospective observational study at a central London teaching hospital to investigate GBS antimicrobial resistance and peri-partum prescribing between 1st April 2016 and 31st March 2019.

Results

939 obstetric patients had GBS identified at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital during the study period. 31% (279(263 resistant and 16 intermediate)/900) were erythromycin resistant and 27% (246/911) clindamycin resistant. 5.6% (51/900) had incongruent erythromycin/clindamycin resistance, presumed erm mediated.

390 women received peri-partum antimicrobials for GBS. The majority of patients received benzylpenicillin therapy (70.2%, 274/390), with cefuroxime (23.1%, 90/390), clindamycin (5.6%,22/390) and teicoplanin (1%,4/390) based therapies also used. 40.9% (9/22) were given clindamycin despite known GBS resistance.

Conclusion

Our data support the national guidelines, with high erythromycin/clindamycin resistance reported locally. Updated UK guidelines for GBS colonised patients recommend the use of vancomycin for beta-lactam allergic patients. Yet where sensitivities are known, clindamycin may still be used for 70% of beta-lactam allergic patients. Vancomycin, more challenging to administer and monitor, can be reserved for beta-lactam allergic, clindamycin resistant GBS carriers which account for a minority of the population (2.8%). Developing a working pathway implementation is challenging as evident with the inappropriate clindamycin use in 9 patients locally.

Background

The clinical presentation of tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL) can mimic that of other pathologies; obtaining a tissue diagnosis is therefore essential. Dual pathology can manifest as apparent treatment failure and rare cases of coexistent lymphoma have been reported.

Case description

A 54-year-old fit and well man of African-Caribbean origin presented with an 8-week history of dysphagia, breathlessness and weight loss. He was tachypnoeic and thin with right supraclavicular and axillary lymphadenopathy.

An HIV test was negative. A CT thorax demonstrated clear lung fields and a 7.2cm mediastinal soft tissue mass compressing the oesophagus and trachea.

US-guided core biopsies of a supraclavicular lymph node showed necrotising granulomatous inflammation. There was no evidence of lymphoma on immunohistochemistry. An acid-fast bacillus was seen on Wade-Fite staining.

Voractiv was commenced for suspected TBL. Tissue culture subsequently grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Susceptibility to treatment was confirmed by whole genome sequencing.

After two months of treatment he remained symptomatic with continued weight loss. The possibility of dual pathology was considered, and the index biopsy revisited. Steroids were commenced for a possible paradoxical reaction, resulting in some initial clinical improvement.

Ten weeks into treatment, he further deteriorated requiring artificial nutrition and tracheal stenting. Repeat CT imaging showed enlargement of the mediastinal mass, now extending into the oesophageal lumen. Oesophageal biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma.

Conclusions

We report a case of TBL with coexistent adenocarcinoma, which whilst rare highlights the importance of reassessment for dual pathology in cases of biopsy proven TBL that fails to respond to appropriate anti-tuberculous therapy.

Background

In view of the new IDSA clinical practice guidelines, we investigated C. difficile infection (CDI) rates and performance against the key standards in our infants and immunosuppressed paediatric patients.

Methods

Using electronic patient notes and microbiology systems, we collected data on every positive PCR result between June 2016 and March 2018 in our paediatric population. Information included risk factors, markers of severity and medical management.

Results

48 samples were sent for C. difficile testing, from which 22 patients had positive results at an average age of 7.4 years. Only five samples were sent from patients under 2 year olds, of which four were PCR positive but toxin negative. Out of 22 positive patient samples, 9 were toxin positive. Risk factors for CDI included previous antibiotics or inpatient stay in the last 3 months, as well as recent PPI use. Only one patient had toxin positive CDI with severe disease. Overall the management of CDI in both toxin positive and negative patients was appropriate in terms of antibiotic choice and duration, and was tailored to specific patient circumstances. A high proportion of CDI patients were immunosuppressed or had recently undergone bone marrow transplants, but often showed no signs of severe infection (fever, raised inflammatory markers).

Conclusion

There should be a low threshold in testing patients who are immunosuppressed, as they are more likely to develop CDI. There were no toxin positive cases in patients under two years of age, which confirms that the test is not useful in this population.

Background

The United Kingdom National Guidelines for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing 2008 suggest that an HIV test should be considered in all general medical admissions, when diagnosed HIV prevalence exceeds 2 in 1000 in the local population. We evaluated physician-initiated HIV testing rates in the Acute Assessment Unit of an East London hospital.

Methods

All acute presentations over one month were reviewed retrospectively, using electronic records. Patients with confirmed HIV were identified and the requested diagnostic HIV tests were measured. The number of patients with clinical indicator conditions for adult HIV infection, as defined in the United Kingdom National Guidelines for HIV Testing 2008, who did not receive appropriate testing, was calculated.

Results

In the cohort of 1023 patients, two patients had known HIV. 58 diagnostic HIV tests were performed, including 40 tests in patients with no clinical indicator diseases. There were five admissions with ‘AIDS-defining conditions’, all of which were pulmonary tuberculosis and four out of five (80.0%) were tested. There were 118 admissions with ‘conditions where HIV testing should be offered’, 14 of which (11.9%) were tested. All HIV tests were negative.

Conclusion

Physician-initiated HIV testing was inadequate for such a high prevalence area, even in clinical indicator diseases. Physician-initiated HIV testing should be replaced with routine opt-out HIV testing in acute medical admissions units in areas of high HIV prevalence, as suggested by BHIVA (British HIV Association) guidelines, as we progress towards ending the HIV epidemic in the United Kingdom.

Chronic wounds, for instance venous, pressure, arterial and diabetic ulcers, are a major health problem throughout the world. Compared with normal wounds, those that take more than four weeks to heal are defined as chronic. Interestingly, the numbers of patients suffering from chronic wounds and the cost for treatment have been increasing during the past two decades. There is increasing evidence that suggests that bacteria infect those chronic wounds and there exist as a biofilm, which affects the wound healing and success of wound treatment. The aim of this project is to develop a dynamic ex vivomodel to mimic Staphylococcus aureus biofilm on infected chronic wound using artificial wound fluid, 3D printing and porcine skin. This dynamic model also will be used to determine drug delivery from commercial antibiotic discs and poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) electrospun fibrous matrices. The results indicated that our new developed dynamic model was succeed with mimicking S. aureus biofilm on infected chronic wounds. Compared our flow system with traditional colony biofilm assay (CBA), it had generated an air-liquid-solid interface, which is more approach to real conditions. Meanwhile, drug delivery from PCL electrospun matrices had been tested with both CBA and flow system. The results provided further strong evidence on the benefaction of our new developed ex vivomodel. In summary, this new developed easily application model will be potentially significant on improving studying treatments of biofilms on infected chronic wounds.

Background: The clinical presentation of Scrub typhus mimics other acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses (AUFI) thus making it difficult to diagnose clinically.

Methods: Patients hospitalized with acute febrile illness (2-21 days) along with clinical suspicion for scrub typhus were evaluated for specific IgM antibodies against O. tsutsugamushi by ELISA and details of demographic, clinical, laboratory and clinical complication/outcomes related parameters collected for statistical analysis.

Results: Scrub typhus IgM antibodies by ELISA were detected in 88 (18.1%) patients out of 486 patients hospitalized with acute febrile illness and clinically suspected for Scrub typhus between September 2015 and January 2017. The majority sero-positive cases were found in July-December (p=0.02). Out of 88, twenty nine sero-positive Scrub typhus patients had serological evidence of co-infections. Eschar was observed in 11 (12.5%) sero-positive patients. Of 88, 23 sero-positive Scrub typhus patients died. A low platelet count (RR: 0.99; 95% CI:0.98-1.00, p=0.02), requirement of intensive care (RR: 2.26; 95% CI: 0.19-26.5, p = 0.01), need for mechanical ventilation (RR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.35-10.86, p =0.003) and metabolic acidosis (RR: 3.47; 95% CI: 0.9-13.4, p = 0.03) were associated with mortality among sero-positive Scrub typhus patients. An appropriate antibiotic administration (n=46/88) was associated with clinical recovery/discharge (n=42/46; p=0.002).

Conclusion: Our results emphasize early diagnosis and administration of appropriate antibiotic for the management of scrub typhus in view of multiple etiologies in the initial diagnostic workup of patients presenting with AUFI. Thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care were associated with adverse clinical outcome among patients with Scrub typhus.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and frequently recur. Successful management is challenging, with UTIs responsible for 14% of community antibiotic prescriptions. Improving the management of recurrent UTIs is a national priority carrying major implications for antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

We have introduced a multi-specialty clinic with a personalized approach to antimicrobial prescribing. Together a consultant medical microbiologist and a consultant urologist assess each patient’s pre-disposing risk factors and symptomatic burden. Anatomical and functional urological factors, and issues such as poor sample quality and lifestyle are investigated. Choice of antimicrobial agent, as well as the mode and frequency of administration, is made in accordance with patient preferences, resistance patterns, and risk factors.

Primary and secondary care data was collected for the year preceding and the year following initial clinic attendance. The impact of attendance on acute admissions, antibiotic prescribing, diagnostics utilization, and primary care workload was assessed.

Results

We assessed the impact of 36 clinic attendances. We noted a 91% reduction in acute admissions, a 73% drop in UTI related primary care attendances, a 57% fall in antibiotic prescriptions, and a 61% reduction in the number of MSUs sent. Qualitative data also indicates a substantial impact on patient quality of life.

Conclusion

To our knowledge we are the first center to utilize a multi-speciality recurrent UTI clinic to personalize antimicrobial and surgical therapy in tandem. Improvement in clinical outcomes is matched by reduced workload. Further study will assess long-term impact and will support regional adoption of this stratagem.

Background:

We report a case of post-influenza invasive aspergillosis causing ventriculitis in a patient immunosuppressed on methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis.

Summary:

A 63-year-old male with a positive H1N1 throat swab presented with increasing dyspnoea and pyrexia that failed to improve despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and zanamivir. Imaging of his chest showed cavitating lung disease and a possible post influenza fungal infection. He was initiated on antifungal treatment that was stopped after 10 days following a negative bronchoalveolar lavage and serum galactomann test. Respiratory symptoms and inflammatory markers improved but he developed confusion and falls. Computed tomography of the head showed hydrocephalus but there was no papilloedema. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed lymphocytosis with elevated proteins but negative initial investigations. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the head with contrast showed obstructing hydrocephalus with ventriculitis. He underwent an urgent ventriculostomy by the neurosurgeons which demonstrated purulent CSF. CSF testing was strongly positive for beta-D glucan, a positive PCR result for aspergillus in CSF was received from the initial lumbar puncture and histology from operative samples showed fungal hyphae. Dual antifungal treatment was recommenced but the patient’s conditioned worsened, and he died on ITU.

Conclusion:

Whilst invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a recognised complication of influenza, extrapulmonary infection is less well documented. This is the first case in the literature in which ventriculitis due to aspergillus is described as a sequel to infection with influenza. Clinicians should remain vigilant for fungal infection in patients with influenza who are immunosuppressed.

Background: Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (MS-SAB) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Long courses of intravenous antibiotics are the traditionally recommended mainstay of treatment but are often not completed in clinical practice. Shorter courses are potentially attractive from an antimicrobial stewardship and resource perspective, but require a good evidence base.

Methods: A retrospective audit of MS-SAB management within Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (2016-17). Laboratory database was used to identify all cases of MS-SAB. Demographic details, risk factors and management were recorded from patient records. Outcomes were defined as 90d recurrence-free survival, 30d mortality, 30-90d mortality and recurrence before 90d.

Results: A total of 281 adult cases were identified with adequate data available for review. Predictors of early (30d) mortality were: age, 71.4y vs 58y p<0.001; HAI, 21.4% vs 8.6% p=0.003; osteo-articular infections, 2.5% vs 17.1% p=0.016; but not antibiotic choice. In cases surviving 30d (n=238), median antibiotic durations were: intravenous 10d (range, 0-115), total 18d (0-316). 83% received ≥14d total, 41% received ≥14d intravenous. Receiving <9d intravenous (OR 3.33 (95%CI 1.01- 10.95) or <14d total therapy (OR 4.19 (1.37-12.84) was predictive of recurrent bacteraemia, as was non-beta-lactam therapy (16% vs 4%, p=0.006), and poor CRP response at end of intravenous therapy (68% vs 35% of peak CRP, p<0.001).

Conclusions: These data suggest lower durations (9-14d) of intravenous therapy could be safe in MS-SAB, however very short courses (<9d) are associated with worse outcomes. This new evidence helps inform guidelines, balancing optimised patient outcomes alongside improved antimicrobial stewardship.

Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is driven by antimicrobial exposure. Engaging the general public with this issue is vital in order to shape attitudes and change behaviour. A primary school musical (‘The Mould that Changed the World’) was developed as a novel educational strategy with the explicit aim of engaging the public in the fight against AMR.

Methods: The musical was implemented in two primary schools as workshops followed by public performances. There were 166 child participants aged 9 to 11 years. Quantitative data was collected through a classroom questionnaire before the musical, two weeks after, and six months after. Qualitative data were collected through children’s focus groups before the musical and two weeks after.

Results: Knowledge of the key messages of the musical had increased two weeks after the musical (proportion test, 0.65, 0.77, p<0.001) and this gain in knowledge was sustained six months later (proportion test, 0.65, 0.82, p<0.001). Children recognised factors contributing to AMR, felt empowered to change their own health behaviours and demonstrated antimicrobial stewardship with intention to reduce antibiotic use. They suggested the musical had stimulated discussion around these topics at home. The musical was perceived as an enjoyable and memorable way to learn about AMR.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates potential for the use of musical theatre in this field as a novel device to improve long-term knowledge, change attitudes and emotionally engage the general public through children. Alongside existing interventions, it represents a further unique and valuable tool in the fight against AMR.

Background

Diabetic foot infections are an increasing healthcare issue and managing these infections can be difficult. A recent innovation in the way they are managed in the Hull clinic is the use of antibiotic impregnated (generally Gentamicin and Vancomycin) STIMULAN beads. Often only a couple of beads can be used in a foot wound making it a very uneconomical strategy if the beads can’t be stored and used on other wounds. There is no recommended quality assurance method provided by the manufacturers to validate this practice leading to this study.

Methods

Five beads were removed from a batch; at 1, 4, 8 and 12 week intervals for testing:

Bacterial Challenge: a 10mL spot of bead suspension was placed on Mueller Hinton seeded with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and E. coli ATCC 25922 and incubated in Air, at 35±1ºC for 18±2hrs; zones of inhibition were read and recorded.

TDM: Vancomycin and Gentamicin levels present in each bead was established by analysing 50mL of suspension (1:5 DF) using a therapeutic drug monitoring assay.

Results

Beads were microbiologically active for 12 weeks with no notable loss of potency.

Bacterial challenge: Staphylococcus aureus range 17-23mm, av. 20.4mm and E. coli range 11-20mm, av. 17.5mm.

TDM Assay: Vancomycin range 62.01 – 110.18 Av. 88.88mg/L, Gentamicin range 20.38 – 27.41 Av.23.20mg/L.

Conclusion

Quality assurance of the STIMULAN beads can be established using standard TDM assays and microbiological activity, enabling a kit to be used for up to 12 weeks with clinical confidence.

Background:

Strongyloidiasis is a neglected nematode infestation and can lead to hyperinfection syndrome. The onset of strongyloides hyper-infection syndrome is associated with a myriad of seemingly unrelated symptoms including diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urticaria, anaemia, sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Case report:

A 65-year-old female patient presenting with chief complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fever and cough and was admitted to a teaching hospital on 2nd May 2019. The patient was a diagnosed case of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura on Azathioprine (50mg, BD) and oral corticosteroid therapy (Prednisolone 60mg, OD) and was on treatment from the same hospital. The patient developed these symptoms after 23 days of immunosuppressive therapy. Patient was continued with previous medication along with supportive management after admission. Blood and urine sample was received in the department of Microbiology on 3rd May 2019 for culture and sensitivity testing. Urine sample was sterile after 24 hours of aerobic incubation. Escherichia coli grew in blood culture and the isolate was susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin and colistin. Stool sample was received on 6th of May 2019 for routine microscopy. With wet mount preparation of stool specimen, numerous larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis were seen. Modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed and oocysts of Cryptosporidium species were also seen. Wet mount preparation of sputum sample was also performed in which few larvae of S. stercoralis were seen.

Conclusion:

As corticosteroid is the mainstay of treatment in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura an early diagnosis and prompt specific anti-parasitic therapy is required to eradicate these infections

Background

Between 2016-18, infection prevention (IP) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) projects were developed independently by Girlguiding and Scout groups across four UK regions. The UK 5-year AMR Action Plan outlines the importance of public engagement. This abstract describes the development, pilot and initial evaluation of a national infection prevention (IP) and AMR resource pack for Girlguiding and Scouts.

Methods

Early 2019, PHE developed a national working-group, including local pilot individuals, and Girlguiding and Scout volunteers interested in IP and AMR to agree on the content of a national programme through a consensus approach. Summer 2019, the programme was piloted across the UK. Initial evaluation included course leader feedback and an age-appropriate survey.

Results

The consensus process concluded that the programme should include interactive e-Bug activities regarding microbes; hand, respiratory and food hygiene; antimicrobials and AMR. To consolidate learning, participants would create posters, make Antibiotic Guardian pledges, and share these with their families. A draft resource pack was developed to enable the programme to be delivered by leaders without a science/health background. Initial evaluation with over 150 children will be presented, to include enjoyment, acquisition of knowledge, and intentions to change health behaviours (i.e. improve hand and respiratory hygiene, and only use antibiotics when needed). Feedback from children and leaders will be used to update the resource pack prior to launch.

Conclusion

This national programme is engaging and delivers key IP and AMR messages. The programme will be launched for World Antibiotics Awareness Week 2019. Full evaluation planned for 2020.

Background: Endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare but serious ocular infection. Seeding is usually haematogenous, and the visual prognosis is poor. We present 2 cases of bacterial endophthalmitis rapidly following viral retinitis in patients with a history of renal transplantation and no systemic symptoms of bacteraemia.

Case 1:

A 47 year old woman presented with features of bilateral panuveitis with retinitis, with no systemic symptoms.She had a history of renal transplantation. Escherichia coli had been isolated from multiple previous blood and urine cultures in the preceding months. A diagnosis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis was made on the basis of positive PCR from aqueous humour, and antiviral treatment commenced. Her left eye vision subsequently deteriorated. A repeat sample grew E. coli with a matching antibiogram to her previous isolates.

Case 2:

A 55 year old man presented with features of right-sided panuveitis and acute retinal necrosis, with no systemic symptoms. He had a history of renal transplantation. A diagnosis of varicella zoster virus (VZV) retinitis was made on the basis of positive PCR from the aqueous humour, and antiviral treatment commenced. His symptoms deteriorated, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated by culture from a repeat sample. Imaging of the sinuses revealed inflammatory changes.

Conclusions:

We hypothesise that endophthalmitis in these two immunocompromised patients may have been opportunistically enabled by disruption of the blood-ocular barrier by the preceding viral infection, allowing a transient bacteraemia to seed. Whether there may be any role for prophylactic antibiotics in this context would benefit from further study.

Background: Molecular tests are increasingly used in culture negative endocarditis and may be helpful adjuncts to diagnosis; here we report the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitral valve endocarditis in an immunocompetent patient.

Case History: A previously well 63 year old man presented with a ten day history of fever, nights sweats and progressive shortness of breath. On arrival, he was in acute respiratory distress, in pulmonary oedema and had a pansystolic murmur. A transoesophageal echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation and a mass on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. He was treated for a presumed native valve endocarditis with Amoxicillin, Flucloxacillin and Gentamicin. He had a minimally invasive mitral valve repair; a vegetation was noted. All initial cultures and serologies were negative. He improved and was discharged on ceftriaxone and doxycycline on OPAT. Results three weeks post-surgery showed a Beta D Glucan of >500pg/mL (cut off 80) and an 18S PCR on the valve positive for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No histology was available from the vegetation and fungal cultures were negative. He was much improved at that point and received 6 weeks of voriconazole to treat invasive infection; his Beta D Glucan fell to less than 30 and he was well on follow-up.

Conclusion: Saccharomyces cerevisae is an unusual cause of an endocarditis in an immunocompetent patient. This case illustrates the importance of considering non-bacterial causes of endocarditis in such cases and the utility of molecular diagnostics as adjuncts to traditional culture techniques.

We report a case of disseminated Fusobacterium nucleatum likely secondary to an undiagnosed perforated sigmoid diverticulum. A 50-year old male, (past history of COPD, schizophrenia and diverticulosis) presented with fever, seizures and progressive leg weakness over 4 days. Examination revealed left leg weakness and hepatomegaly. CT-brain showed bilateral supra-tentorial lesions with sulcal effacement; MRI findings were consistent with abscesses. Initial management included burr-hole drainage of 2 intra-cranial lesions and treatment with ceftriaxone and metronidazole. The patient defervesced post-operatively.

Blood cultures (day 1) and cerebral pus (day 3) grew Fusobacterium nucleatum after 5 days. HIV Ab/Ag negative. Subsequent imaging excluded endocarditis, intra-cardiac shunting and jugular vein thrombosis. CT revealed pulmonary emboli, liver abscess (68x46x42 mm, inaccessible to drainage) and localised sigmoid perforation. Later, the patient admitted to a 5-day period of severe self-limiting abdominal pain 2-weeks prior to admission, probably relating to sigmoid perforation.

The patient required further neurosurgical drainage (day 10) due to fluctuating consciousness; intra-operative samples were culture negative. Neurological improvement occurred during 4 weeks treatment. Total antibiotic duration will be determined by follow-up imaging.

Fusobacterium spp.are fastidious Gram-negative rods. Microscopy can differentiate the main pathogenic species showing tapered ends (F. nucleatum) or pleomorphic rods (F. necrophorum). Malignancy, diabetes and immunosuppression/HIV are associated, but none are present here. Presentations include abscesses, bacteraemia, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis and endocarditis. This case highlights the need for early sampling, careful history regarding source, covering at least 2-4 weeks preceding presentation, and demonstrates paradoxical deterioration after antibiotics and drainage, likely due to post-treatment inflammatory reaction.

Hepatitis E virus has, over the past few years, been increasingly recognised as a cause of acute hepatitis in the western world. The first hepatitis E Standard for Microbiology Investigations (SMI) was issued in November 2018 and recommends cascading testing in immunocompetent individuals, with RNA assays clarifying results of antibody assays. We investigated all clinical samples tested for hepatitis E in our regional laboratory between October 2014 and October 2018 (12671 IgM, 10738 IgG and 2290 RNA assays). In 495 cases, samples collected within 24 hours from a patient underwent IgM assays (DS2 platform) and PCR assays (in-house). 7 pairs, corresponding to 5 patients, of 404 pairs with negative or low-positive IgM results, had detectable RNA. 4 of those 5 patients were demonstrably immunocompromised; the final sample came from general practice without further details. 3/5 patients had reactive IgG assays, and one of the two remaining patients had a rise in IgM titre between two successive samples. We conclude that, in our sample population, hepatitis E RNA PCR testing adds minimal diagnostic information in immunocompetent individuals with negative or low-positive IgM results. This finding supports current testing cascade recommendations. We discuss our sample population’s demographics and external validity of findings: in particular, we saw few tests sent by neurologists. Finally, we briefly discuss other IgM/IgG/PCR result scenarios and our findings in relation to current SMI recommendations, and speculate how our findings affect understanding of antibody response and viraemia in hepatitis E infection.

Background: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a unique immunosuppressed state, and the consequences of infection are often severe. We hypothesized that disruption of the faecal microbiota (such as with use of broad spectrum antibiotics) may predispose to gastrointestinal related sepsis post bone marrow transplantation.

Methods: We reviewed the laboratory data from all BMT patients between January 2016 and August 2018 and recorded the presence of bacteraemia. We matched these patients to controls with no recorded bacteraemia. We then recorded antibiotic exposure in the immediate pre-transplant period.

Results: 238 records were reviewed (81 allografts, 157 autografts). We identified 28 patients with bacteraemia from gastrointestinal related pathogens. 28 controls with no positive blood cultures were matched according to the type of BMT. In both groups there were 18 allografts, 12 of which were matched unrelated donors. In the bacteraemic group there were a total of 12 antibiotic episodes (60 days) pre-transplant, compared with 6 (41 days) in the control group. The most common antibiotics used were meropenem (47 days in the bacteraemic group, 24 control) and piperacillin/tazobactan (13 days in the bacteraemic group, 3 control).

Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that broad spectrum antibiotics pre-transplant may predispose to post-transplant sepsis. Although the small population size limits this study, further studies are necessary to confirm this finding, and to investigate which components of the faecal microbiota are the most important to preserve prior to BMT. This may open the door to novel therapeutics in this patient group, such as faecal microbiota transplant.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with significant healthcare cost, morbidity, and mortality, but can be difficult to identify, resulting in over-diagnosis and excessive use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. In addition, some organisms commonly cultured from the airways of critically ill patients, in particular Candida species, are of unknown clinical significance.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was conducted across five intensive care units in the North-West of England. Participants were enrolled within 24 hours of commencing antimicrobial therapy for suspected VAP. Laboratory-confirmed VAP was defined by quantitative culture of a known pneumonia-causing pathogen above predetermined growth thresholds.

Univariate logistic regression was used to determine the impact of laboratory-confirmed VAP, APACHE II, culture of Staphylococcus aureus, and culture of Candida species on 30-day mortality.

Results

The prevalence of laboratory-confirmed VAP was 43/96 (44%), and the median number of antimicrobials prescribed for VAP was 1 (range: 1-4). Candida species were identified in 32/96 patients (33%).

The overall 30-day mortality was 22/96 (26%). None of the variables analysed were associated with 30-day mortality, except for culture of Candida species, which was associated with survival (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.98; p= 0.047).

Conclusions

Ventilator-associated pneumonia was confirmed in under half the patients commenced on antimicrobial therapy for suspected VAP, which highlights the urgent need for improved diagnostic strategies. In our clinical practice, Candida species are not treated as pathogenic in VAP, and in this study, growth of Candida species was not associated with excess 30-day mortality.

TKM-130803 is a specific anti-EBOV therapeutic comprising of two small interfering RNAs (siRNA) siLpol-2 and siVP35-2. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of these siRNAs was defined in Ebola virus disease (EVD) patients. The relationship between PK and patient survival was explored.

Plasma concentration of siRNA was compared to survival at 14 days for seven subjects with EVD in Sierra Leone who received 0.3 mg/kg of TKM-130803 by intravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for up to 7 days. PKdatawere fitted to two-compartment models then Monte Carlo simulated PK profiles were compared to ET (Cmax 0.04-0.57 ng/mL and mean concentration 1.43 ng/mL), and TT (3000 ng/mL).

siRNA was in quantitative excess of virus genomes throughout treatment, but the 95% percentile exceeded TT. Plasma concentration of both siRNAs were higher in subjects who died compared to subjects who survived (p<0.025 both siRNAs).The maximum AUC for which the 95% percentile remained under TT was a continuous infusion of 0.15mg/kg/day.

TKM-130803 was circulating at sufficient concentrations, considered needed for efficacy but given extremely high viral loads it seems likely that the patients died because they were physiologically beyond the point of no return. Subjects who died exhibited some indication of impaired drug clearance, justifying caution in dosing strategies for such patients. This analysis has given a useful insight into the pharmacokinetics of the siRNA in the disease state andillustrates the valueof designing PKPD studies into future clinical trials in epidemic situations.

Background:

Neurological sequelae are a rare but recognised complication of Chikungunya infection. We report a case of acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalitis secondary to Chikungunya infection.

Case description:

A 59 year old male presented to the acute medical unit 5 days after returning from a 4 week trip to Kinghasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo complaining of a sudden onset headache with fluctuating confusion and left sided weakness. 1 week previously he had been complaining of fever and fatigue with arthralgia. Whilst in DRC he visited family with no travel outside Kinghasa and no infectious contacts or high risk activities. A malaria film was negative and a lumber puncture on admission demonstrated 296/mm3 white cells with 75% polymorphs and 25% lymphocytes, protein of 1.5 g/L and glucose of 4.2 mmol/L ( serum 7.4 mmol/L).

Over the next 24 hours his GCS dropped and he needed intubation. The appearance of the MRI head was highly unusual and the neuroradiologist felt this was most likely an acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHLE) confirmed later on brain biopsy. All subsequent investigations were negative except viral serology demonstrating a positive chikungunya IgM with later IgG seroconversion.

The patient received steroids, anti tuberculous treatment, antibiotics and plasma exchange with little neurological improvement.

Conclusion

With the increasing incidence of chikungunya, more neurological complications are being recognised. AHLE is a very rare form of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis usually triggered by an infection; however there have been no case reports of chikungunya causing AHLE leading us to believe this may be the first case.

Introduction: Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective and licensed treatment for recurrent and refractory Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and has shown encouraging signals for treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Access to FMT has been limited by the introduction of new regulations in the UK. Centres producing FMT are now required to hold a manufacturing licence from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Methods:The first licenced FMT service in UK - University of Birmingham Microbiome Treatment Centre (UoBMTC) was launched in 2017. Policies and procedures were developed in accordance with MHRA ‘Good Manufacturing Practice’ guide.

Results: Since August 2018, 132 FMT aliquots have been supplied for recurrent and refractory CDI to 39 NHS Trusts across UK. Twenty-nine of these Trusts did not have access / perform FMT prior to this service. In all cases, FMT was delivered within 48 hours (unless delayed delivery was requested). The service is the sole supplier of FMT since 2018 via an NHS Innovation and Technology Tariff. UoBMTC has also to date supplied 360 FMT aliquots for a multi-centre trial of FMT in UC (STOP-Colitis). Furthermore, the service has provided FMT to other refractory conditions within clinical settings.

Conclusions: Development of a licenced FMT facility has greatly enhanced equality of access for this treatment across the NHS. FMT is provided at a zero-cost model for CDI and is available within 48 hours of request. UoBMTC continues to facilitate research in this field by providing FMT for clinical trials exploring its use for other indications.

Developing a PCR-Based Diagnostic Method of Detecting the Prevalence of Emerging Tick-Borne Diseases in Scotland

Ticks are able to transmit zoonotic pathogens to humans including the most frequently reported Borrelia burgdorferi, and the lesser known Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia miyamotoi, Babesia spp., and Rickettsia spp. Ticks also play an important role in the spread and maintenance of disease lifecycles. Lyme disease is currently the only tick-borne disease monitored by health professionals in Scotland, however, it is still underreported and misdiagnosed. In this study adult female ticks from 32 hedgehogs from various locations in Scotland were tested for the presence of tick-borne infections using PCR and confirmed by sequencing. PCR results showed there was an 18.75% incidence of B. burgdorferi, 34.38% of B. miyamotoi, 12.5% of Rickettsia spp., 3.13% of A. phagocytophilum, and 3.13% of Babesia spp. 100% of the ticks were confirmed as Ixodes ricinusand from hedgehog hosts. A co-infection of B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi was found by PCR and has not been previously reported in the UK. B. burgdorferi was confirmed by sequencing as B. afzelii, however, B. miyamotoi has not been confirmed by sequencing. Another co-infection of B. miyamotoi, Babesia spp., and Rickettsia spp. was found by PCR, however, not confirmed by sequencing. Detection of co-infections in human cases is difficult due to the similar nature of the infections, making it difficult to differentiate between pathogens. This study aims to develop a methodology capable of distinguishing between pathogens, identify the tick and host species, and determine the prevalence of tick-borne disease in Scotland by PCR.

Aim: There are no reliable estimates of the half-lives of maternal antibodies to the antigens found in the primary series vaccines. We aimed to calculate the half-lives of passively acquired antibodies in infants born to mothers participating in studies of tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination during pregnancy. We aimed to determine whether decay rates varied according to maternal age, birthweight, sex, socioeconomic status, country, or vaccine received.

Methods: De-identified individual participant data from infants born to women taking part in 9 studies of maternal immunization, in 8 countries (UK, Belgium, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, Pakistan, USA and the Netherlands) were combined. Blood samples were taken at two timepoints before any Tdap containing vaccines were received by the infant: at birth and at 2-months of age. Decay rates for each antigen were log2-transformed and meta-analysis performed. Half-lives were calculated by taking the reciprocal of the absolute value of the mean decay rates.

Results: A total of 4,091 samples were included in the analysis and there was significant variation between studies. There was significant variation in the half-lives of the 6 antigens of interest (p<0.001), with estimates ranging from 28.1 days for diphtheria to 35.6 days for filamentous haemagglutinin. The decay of maternal antibodies did not significantly differ by country-level socioeconomic status, maternal age, sex, birthweight or maternal vaccination.

Conclusion: Maternal antibodies decay at different rates for the different antigens, however the magnitude of the differences are small. Differences in laboratory techniques may account for some of the variability between studies.

Recurrent UTIs are associated with increased hospitalisation and antibiotic use. We investigated patients with recurrent ESBL versus non-ESBL UTIs to identify risk factors and potential treatments.

A30 month retrospective case-control study was performed in patients with recurrent EBSL versus non-ESBL UTI. Definition :1) > three in a year (>two weeks apart) or 2) > two in six months (>one week apart) with the same profile. 3) ESBL UTIs were Enterobacteriaceae resistant to cefalexin AND ceftazadime/ceftriaxone.

281/1449 “recurrent UTI” patients were ESBLs. Patients were more likely to be older, male, with associated bacteraemia, colonisation with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) and higher resistance rates to non beta-lactam antibiotics. 75% of renal patients were transplant cases, 81% of urology patients had a tube insertion.

Faecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is widely utilised for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Use of FMT for the intestinal eradication of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) has been described in the literature with decolonisation rates from 37.5% to 87.5%. We perform FMT via naso-gastric tube using donor stool prepared anaerobically, using prevention of invasive disease as an endpoint.

FMT was considered for either; 1) Patients who were colonised with >1 MDRO (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin resistant Enterococci or extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) and at risk of invasive MDRO disease or 2) patients who had recurrent MDRO-mediated invasive disease.

Sixteen MDRO colonised/infected patients underwent FMT. Nine patients had a haematological disorder. Eight of these patients had had prolonged admissions (range 6-20 weeks) complicated by septic episodes (5/9 had a MDR bacteraemia) pre-FMT. Post FMT all patients had shorter admissions including five who received higher intensity immunosuppression. Only 1/9 developed MDRO-mediated invasive disease.

Seven FMT patients had recurrent ESBL urinary tract infections (UTIs). 4/7 were renal transplant patients. Following FMT the 3 non-transplant patients had no further UTIs up to six month period. Four transplant patients had reduced number of infections, admissions and use of antibiotics.

5/13 (39%) patients were not MDRO colonised on rectal screens post-FMT (follow up range 12 weeks – 24 months).

Although decolonisation rates were low, patient outcomes post-FMT were apparently improved. Mechanisms of FMT have not fully been established, improvement of colonisation resistance by restoration of microbiota composition or functionality in at risk groups could be more important than intestinal eradication.

Background

Strokes are frequently seen in older patients mainly due to long standing hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyper cholesterolemia. It is not common in younger adults especially when there is no obvious cause. The workup to find the cause is often difficult in such cases.

Case Description

A 38-year-old paraplegic male presented in Emergency Department with the complaints of fever, headache, haematuria and awaiting closure of left hip wound; however, it seemed non infected. Regarding his medical history, he had ASD associated with pulmonary hypertension and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Besides, after 24hrs of admission he developed right sided neglect. On examination, he was febrile with increased heart rate and respiratory rate. Moreover, he had right homonymous hemianopia and NIHSS score was 3. CT PA was done to rule out pulmonary embolism. Additionally, CT CAP and CT head showed splenic infarct and occipital infarct, respectively. Therefore, a diagnosis of paradoxical embolus was made and treated accordingly. Later, blood culture revealed beta haemolytic streptococci and the underlying cause of septic stroke was thought to be hip ulcer extending to bone. This was followed by CT pelvis, on which bone destruction was seen. Therefore, antibiotics were commenced and left hemiarthoplasty was done.

Conclusion

This case illustrate that in younger population, often soft tissue and bone infection can lead to pro-thrombotic events resulting into septic emboli, a potential cause of stroke (especially when accompanied by ASD). Early assessment and management is valuable as it can lead to serious complications and increased morbidity.
