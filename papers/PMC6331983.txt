To search for 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, a new indole alkaloid termed 6-bromo-N-propionyltryptamine (1), together with one known homologue 6-bromo-N-acetyltryptamine (2) were isolated and identified from a marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas rubra QD1-2. Compound 1 with an N-propionyl side chain exhibited stronger 5-HT2A receptor antagonist activity than that of N-acetyl derivative (2), indicating that 6-bromotryptamine analogues with a longer chain acyl group perhaps displayed a more potent capacity to the target. Therefore, a series of new 6-bromotryptamine analogues (3–7) with different chain length of the acyl group (C4–C8) were prepared and evaluated activity against 5-HT2A receptor. Remarkably, 6-bromo-N-hexanoyltryptamine (5) displayed the most effective inhibitory activity, which was 5-fold stronger than that of the parent compound 1 and showed 70% efficacy of the positive control (ketanserin tartrate).

1. Introduction
Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter that modulates a wide range of physiological and behavioral functions of the central nervous system (CNS), including cognition, mood, mating, feeding, and sleeping [1,2,3]. 5-HT receptors are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, which are categorized into seven major families, 5-HT1−7. Among them, the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily contains three members, namely 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. Extensive studies have revealed that the 5-HT2A receptor played a critical role in the regulation of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with depression, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease [4,5,6,7]. Hence, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist is therapeutically relevant for neurological disorders. For instance, M100907 with the 5-HT2A antagonist activity has entered onto the phase II clinical trial for the treatment of schizophrenia [8].

In our continuing program on the discovery of 5-HT2A receptor antagonists from marine bacterial culture broths, the EtOAc extract from Pseudoalteromonas rubra QD1-2 displayed promising activity. Bioassay-guided isolation procedures led to the obtaining of 6-bromo-N-propionyltryptamine (1) and 6-bromo-N-acetyltryptamine (2) (Figure 1). Intriguingly, the new compound (1) with N-propionyl side chain showed a higher inhibitory activity than that of N-acetyl derivative (2), thus revealing that a longer chain acyl group attached to 6-bromotryptamine probably possessed a better inhibition capacity to 5-HT2A receptor. In order to test this hypothesis, a new series of 6-bromotryptamine derivatives with a longer chain length than that of compounds 1 and 2, were synthesized (3–7, Scheme 1) and evaluated the preliminary structure-activity relationships (SAR). Consequently, compound 5 with N-hexanoyl side chain was identified as the most potent one in the series of 6-bromotryptamine scaffold. Herein, we report the isolation, identification, synthesis, and SAR of 6-bromotryptamine derivatives.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Structure Elucidation of 6-Bromotryptamine Derivatives 1–2
Compound 1 was obtained as a yellowish powder. The molecular formula was established as C13H15BrN2O by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS), which gave equal-intensity ions at m/z 317.0269/319.0254 [M + Na]+, suggesting 1 contained one bromine atom. The 13C-NMR spectrum of 1 showed signals for one amide carbonyl group at δC 177.0 (C-13), four sp2 quaternary carbons at δC 113.8 (C-3), 115.7 (C-6), 127.3 (C-9), 138.9 (C-8), four sp2 methines at δC 115.1 (C-7), 120.8 (C-4), 122.7 (C-5), 124.3 (C-2), three methylenes at δC 26.1 (C-10), 43.3 (C-11), and one methyl at δC 10.5 (C-15). The 1H-NMR signals at δH 7.07 (1H, s, H-2), 7.10 (1H, dd, J = 8.5, 1.8 Hz, H-5), 7.47 (1H, d, J = 8.4 Hz, H-4), and 7.48 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz, H-7) displayed a classic pattern for a 3,5- or 3,6-disubstituted indole moiety, which was supported by the HMBC correlations of H-2/C-3 and C-8, H-4/C-6 and C-8, H-5/C-7 and C-9, and H-7/C-5 and C-9 (Table 1). Furthermore, these HMBC connectivities together with the COSY correlation of H-4/H-5, showed the location of the bromine atom at C-6, which was finally determined by comparison of the observed chemical shifts with those reported for 5 or 6-bromoindole-containing compounds [9,10]. In addition, the COSY correlation of H-10 (δH 2.91, t, J = 7.2 Hz)/H-11 (δH 3.44, t, J = 7.3 Hz) for 1 disclosed the presence of a pair of coupled methylene groups, which was attached to the 6-bromoindole moiety at C-3 due to the HMBC correlations of H-10/C-2 and C-3 and H-11/C-3, thus forming a 6-bromotryptamine moiety (Figure 2). The remaining spectroscopic features of 1 indicated the presence of a propionyl group based on the COSY correlation of H-14 (δH 2.16, q, J = 7.6 Hz)/H-15 (δH 1.09, t, J = 7.7 Hz) and HMBC correlations of H-14 and H-15/C-13 (Figure 2). Finally, the propionyl group was connected to 6-bromotryptamine moiety through an amide bond by the HMBC correlation of H-11/C-13. According to the aforementioned information, the structure of 1 was unambiguously assigned as 6-bromo-N-propionyltryptamine.

Compound 2 was a known synthetic compound but now isolated for the first time as a natural product. Its structure was determined as 6-bromo-N-acetyltryptamine, which was confirmed by comparing their spectral data with the reference reported [11].

2.2. Syntheses of 6-Bromotryptamine Derivatives 3–7
The synthetic route of 3–7 is depicted in Scheme 1, which was carried out by the condensation of 6-bromotryptamine and butyric acid, pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid and octanoic acid, respectively, using 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl) and hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in dichloromethane (DCM) solution at room temperature for 12 h [12,13,14]. Compounds 3–7 were synthesized for the first time in yields ranging from 79% to 85%, the structures of which were identified and characterized by ESI-MS and NMR spectroscopy .This method was proved to provide a rapid, and high yielding procedure to afford acyl chain derivatives of 6-bromotryptamine.

2.3. Structure-Activity Relationships
The 6-bromotryptamine derivatives (1–7) were evaluated at a concentration of 10 μM for their antagonist activity on 5-HT2A receptor detectable by calcium flux assay. The results (Figure 3) highlighted the importance of the length of the acyl chain in the 6-bromotryptamine derivatives for the antagonist activity. Interestingly, we observed that the activity gradually improved in response to increasing chain length (C2–C6), but a reverse tendency occurred when the chain length was C7 or C8. 6-Bromo-N-hexanoyltryptamine (5) thus exhibited an approximately 70% inhibition activity compared with the positive control, which was the most potency in the series. Notably, compound 5 displayed a roughly 4-fold higher inhibitory activity than the parent analogue 1. These observations might be explained by two mechanisms. A longer acyl side chain related to a higher lipophilicity, has the positive consequence in membrane permeation, probably eliciting more effective inhibitory potency for the target. However, the bulk chain (when > C6) caused an acyl group-dependent decrease in the binding affinity, and likely reduced the inhibitory potency for 5-HT2A receptor [15].

3. Experimental Section

3.2. Bacterial Material and Fermentation
The strain P. rubra QD1-2 was isolated from a seawater sample collected from Qingdao Sea area in China, which was stored in China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC, No. 6555). The fermentation was implemented in two steps: seed growth and scale-up fermentation. For the seed growth stage, P. rubra QD1-2 from a plate culture was inoculated into 100 mL of the basic seed medium (peptone 1 g/L, yeast extract 2.5 g/L, glucose 0.1 g/L dissolved in seawater, pH 7.0) in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask and grown in a shaker incubator at 25 °C and 150 rpm for 24 h. Then, seed cultures were inoculated into 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 400 mL of fermentation medium (peptone 1 g/L, yeast extract 2.5 g/L, glucose 0.1 g/L dissolved in seawater, pH 7.0). The strain was fermented on rotary shakers at 25 °C with 150 rpm for 7 days.

3.3. Extraction and Isolation
A total of the 20 L fermentation broth was harvested and filtered by centrifuge and extracted with EtOAc three times. The extract was concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator at 37 °C, which was combined to obtain 1.1 g of crude extract. The extract was directly purified by preparative-HPLC with an isocratic elution of 65% MeOH/H2O (Flow 8 mL/min, UV detection at 280 nm) to afford compounds 1 (12 mg) and 2 (14 mg).

3.5. Antagonist Activity
All the tested compounds were prepared as follows and stored at −20 °C. Compounds 1–7 and the positive control were tested at 10 μM in HBSS buffer (with 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) with 0.1% DMSO. Ketanserin tartrate was employed as positive control. According to the previous method, the inhibitory activity was performed in CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary) cells where recombinant human 5-HT2A receptor was expressed, measured by the calcium flux assay [16,17]. The experiments were carried out in triplicates.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, two 6-bromotryptamine derivatives with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist activity, including a new 6-bromo-N-propionyltryptamine (1) and a known 6-bromo-N-acetyltryptamine (2) were isolated and characterized from the culture broth of a marine-derived P. rubra QD1-2. Moreover, we synthesized a series of new 6-bromotryptamine congeners (3–7) with different chain lengths (C4–C8) and evaluated their antagonist activity for 5-HT2A receptor. Notably, the preliminary SAR studies indicated that the length of the acyl chain dramatically influenced the antagonist activity of 6-bromotryptamine derivatives. Their antagonist activity increased with elongation of the side chain acyl group (C2–C6), while the activity of compounds 6 and 7 with the side chain longer than that of 6-bromo-N-hexanoyltryptamine (C6) significantly declined or disappeared. As the most potent one in this series, 6-bromo-N-hexanoyltryptamine (5) displayed roughly 4-fold activity enhancement over the parent analogue 1, which possessed an approximately 70% inhibition activity comparable to the positive control. Overall, 6-bromo-N-hexanoyltryptamine (5) with a sound antagonist activity for 5-HT2A receptor was identified and our work provides an insight into the further structural optimization of 6-bromotryptamine derivatives for developing potential therapeutic agents to treat neurological disorders.
