Cri-du-chat syndrome (CdCs) is one of the most common contiguous gene syndromes,
with an incidence of 1:15,000 to 1:50,000 live births. To better understand the
etiology of CdCs at the molecular level, we investigated theprotein–protein
interaction (PPI) network within the critical chromosomal region 5p15.3–p15.2
associated with CdCs using systemsbiology. Data were extracted from cytogenomic
findings from patients with CdCs. Based on clinical findings, molecular
characterization of chromosomal rearrangements, and systems biology data, we
explored possible genotype–phenotype correlations involving biological processes
connected with CdCs candidate genes. We identified biological processes
involving genes previously found to be associated with CdCs, such as
TERT, SLC6A3, and
CTDNND2, as well as novel candidate proteins with potential
contributions to CdCs phenotypes, including CCT5, TPPP, MED10, ADCY2, MTRR,
CEP72, NDUFS6, and MRPL36. Although further functional analyses of these
proteins are required, we identified candidate proteins for the development of
new multi-target genetic editing tools to study CdCs. Further research may
confirm those that are directly involved in the development of CdCs phenotypes
and improve our understanding of CdCs-associated molecular mechanisms.

Introduction
Cri-du-chat syndrome (CdCs, OMIM 123450) is one of the most common contiguous gene
syndromes, with an incidence of 1:15,000 to 1:50,000 live births (Niebuhr, 1978; Duarte et al., 2004). Although 5p deletion is
clinically and genetically well described, the phenotypic variability observed among
patients with the deletion suggests that additional modifying factors, including
genetic and environmental factors, may impact patients’ clinical manifestations
(Nguyen et al., 2015).
The classic phenotype of CdCs encompasses a cat-like cry, facial dysmorphism,
microcephaly, psychomotor delays, and intellectual disability (Overhauser et al., 1994). However, the
clinical spectrum and severity of the disease depend of the size of the deleted
chromosomal region (Smith et al.,
2010). Around 80% of individuals with CdCs exhibit de
novo terminal deletions, and 5% exhibit interstitial deletions, where
the deletion is most commonly inherited (Mainardi,
2006). In this sense, approximately 10–15% of the deletions result from
an unbalanced parental translocation (Mainardi,
2006), whereas complex genomic rearrangements, such as mosaicism,
de novo translocation, or ring chromosomes, comprise fewer than
10% of cases (Perfumo et al.,
2000).

Previous studies looking for phenotype–genotype correlations through determination of
deleted regions on 5p have described critical regions related to increased
susceptibility for cat-like cry, speech delay, facial dimorphism, and intellectual
disability (Overhauser et al.,
1994; Church et al.,
1997; Marinescu et al.,
1999; Mainardi et al.,
2001; Zhang et al.,
2005; Elmakky et al.,
2014). Although studies differ in the actual contribution of these
critical regions to a particular phenotype, they allow that refinement of genes
under hemizygous conditions may contribute to the pathogenesis of CdCs (Mainardi, 2006; Damasceno et
al., 2016). Candidate genes, such as TERT,
MARCH6, CTNND2, and SLC6A3,
are considered dose-sensitive or conditionally haploinsufficient (i.e., a single
copy of these genes is insufficient to ensure normal functioning in individuals with
CdCs) (Nguyen et al., 2015).
Haploinsufficiency of the genes mentioned above has been implicated in telomere
maintenance dysfunction, cat-like cry, intellectual disability, and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, respectively (Wu et al., 2005; Du et al., 2007; Hofmeister et al., 2015; Tong et al., 2015).

Even with the increasing resolution of cytogenetic techniques and the large amount of
information available in databases, the investigation of contiguous gene syndromes
remains a challenge. Studies have attempted to characterize genomic rearrangements
and establish genotype–phenotype correlations through the identification of critical
regions of susceptibility to CdCs, candidate genes, and haploinsufficiency-related
altered mechanisms implicated in CdCs phenotypes (Lupski and Stankiewicz, 2005; Nguyen
et al., 2015). Therefore, in this study, to better
understand the etiology of CdCs at the molecular level, we applied an integrative
approach that combines conventional cytogenetic techniques, chromosomal microarray
analysis (CMA), and systems biology tools to elucidate the probable molecular
mechanisms underlying the clinical conditions present in CdCs.

Subjects and Methods
Study design and sample selection
This is a retrospective cytogenomic integrative analysis involving results of a
series of cases. Clinical and cytogenomic data were extracted from six patients
with CdCs enrolled in the Brazilian Network of Reference and Information in
Microdeletion Syndromes (RedeBRIM) project (Riegel et al., 2014, 2017; De Souza et
al., 2015; Dorfman
et al., 2015). The patients were regularly
reevaluated over several years. Psychomotor development assessments were based
on personal observations, school performance, and parent information. Daily
abilities and skills, such as language, social interactions,
concentration/attention, impulsiveness, motor control, perception, and learning
and memory were recorded and published by our group elsewhere (Damasceno
et al., 2016). The five most frequent groups of clinical
findings were selected and registered in the present study. This study has been
approved by the Ethics Research Committee of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto
Alegre (HCPA), followed the Declaration of Helsinki, and the standards
established by the author’s Institutional Review Board.

Cytogenomic Small Region of Overlap (SRO)
The deletions were mapped by whole genome array-CGH using a 60-mer
oligonucleotide-based microarray with a theoretical resolution of 40 kb (8 60K,
Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Labeling and hybridization were
performed following the protocols provided by Agilent 2011. The arrays were
analyzed using a microarray scanner (G2600D) and Feature Extraction software
(version 9.5.1) (both from Agilent Technologies). Image analyses were performed
using Agilent GenomicWorkbench Lite Edition 6.5.0.18 with the statistical
algorithm ADM-2 at a sensitivity threshold of 6.0. The detailed cytogenomic
profiles of the patients analyzed in this study were presented by our group
elsewhere (Damasceno et al., 2016). Based on it, the
chromosomal SRO was determined.

Network design
The protein–protein interaction (PPI) metasearch engine STRING 10.0
(http://string-db.org/) was used to create PPI networks based on genes located
in the SRO. The list of genes was obtained from the human assembly of February
2009 (GRCh37/hg19) (Kent et
al., 1976; von Mering
et al., 2005). The parameters used in STRING
were: (i) degree of confidence, 0.400, with 1.0 being the highest level of
confidence; (ii) 500 proteins in the 1st and 2nd shell;
and (iii) all prediction methods enabled, except for text mining and gene
fusion. The final PPI network obtained through STRING was analyzed using
Cytoscape 3.5 (Shannon et al.,
2003). Non-connected nodes from the networks were not included.

Clustering and GO analysis
The MCODE tool was used to identify densely connected regions in the final
Cytoscape network. The analysis was based on vertex weighting by the local
neighborhood density and outward traversal from a locally dense seed protein to
isolate the highly clustered regions (Bader and
Hogue 2003). The PPI modules generated by MCODE were further studied
by focusing on major biology-associated processes using the Biological Network
Gene Ontology (BiNGO) 3.0.3 Cytoscape plugin (Maere et al., 2005). The degree of functional
enrichment for a given cluster and category was quantitatively assessed
(p-value) using a hypergeometric distribution. Multiple
test correction was also implemented by applying the false discovery rate (FDR)
algorithm (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) at
a significance level of p < 0.05.

Centralities
Two major parameters of network centralities (node degree and betweenness) were
used to identify H-B nodes from the PPI network using the Cytoscape plugin
CentiScaPe 3.2.1 (Scardoni et
al., 2009). The node degree centrality indicates the
total number of adjacent nodes that are connected to a unique node. Nodes with a
high node degree are called hubs and have central functions in a biological
network (Scardoni et al.,
2009). Furthermore, we also analyzed the betweenness score, which
corresponds to the number of shortest paths between two nodes that pass through
a node of interest. Thus, nodes with high betweenness scores, compared to the
average betweenness score of the network, are responsible for controlling the
flow of information through the network topology (Newman, 2006; Scardoni
et al., 2009). These nodes are called
bottlenecks and are normally related to the control of information between
groups of proteins (Scardoni et
al., 2009).

Availability of data and materials
All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published
article and its supplementary information files (Tables S1-S17).

Results
The main clinical findings of six patients with CdCs selected to this study are
presented in Figure 1. Intellectual disability
(6/6 patients), learning difficulties (6/6 patients), multiple congenital
abnormalities (6/6 patients), hyperactivity/impulsiveness (5/6 patients), and heart
defects (4/6 patients) were the most frequent findings (Figure 1). Among the samples, three were from males, with ages
ranging from 6 to 38 years, and three were from females, with ages ranging from 7 to
20 years.

according to Damasceno et al. (2016).
Cytogenomic data analysis MR
Six de novo terminal deletions that ranged in size from
approximately 11.2 Mb to 28.6 Mb, with breakpoints from 5p15.2 to 5p13 were
mapped. The analysis of CMA profile data revealed a small region of overlap
(SRO) of 10.8 Mb encompassing the bands 5p15.33–p15.2. The approximate genomic
position of the SRO is chr5:527552–11411700, comprising 44 genes according to
the UCSC genome browser human assembly of February 2009 (GRCh38/hg19) (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Cytogenomic profile of chromosome 5. Chromosomal critical region of
5p15.33–p15.2. Genes localized to the critical region were obtained from
the human assembly of February 2009 (GRCh37/hg19). Red circles show
genes already associated with CdCs. Green circles show candidate genes
from this study for contributing to the phenotype in CdCs.
Networks and topological analysis
Overall, the scale-free network was composed of 2284 nodes (proteins) and 83340
edges (interactions) (Figure 3). Centrality
analyses were carried out to identify hub-bottlenecks (H-B), the most
topologically relevant nodes. The network hubs (nodes with an above average
number of connections) and betweenness (total number of non-redundant shortest
paths going through a node or edge) indicate the most critical points in a
biological network (Yu et al.,
2007). In our analysis, we observed 273 H-B nodes in the SRO network.
Furthermore, we performed a cluster analysis that identified 16 major cluster
regions above our cutoff score, and gene ontology (GO) analyses were performed
in the identified modules.

Clusters taken into consideration for further analysis were those containing
major proteins related to CdCs and deleted in all patients according to Espitiro Santo (2016), namely those
containing combinations of SLC6A3, SRD5A1, CCT5, ADCY2, TAS2R1, MED10, MTRR,
SLC12A7, CEP72, NDUFS6, MARCH6, LPCAT1, NKD2, CTNND2, TERT, CLPTM1L, MRPL18,
MRPL36, UBE2QL1, PAPD7, and TPPP (Figure
4). In addition, the TERT protein was a commonly clusterized protein, and
all clusters containing TERT were selected. Clusters that did not contain
multiple combinations of the CdCs protein targets mentioned above, TERT, were
excluded from the final analysis.

the NF-κB/IκB pathway. The relative number of GO terms associated with each
cluster can be found in Figure 5. Our
analysis excluded GO terms that were not associated with significant biological
processes related to the disease, or that were too general (e.g., regulation of
biological process, signaling process, or response to endogenous stimulus).

Discussion
CdCs patients are traditionally diagnosed based on a detailed clinical evaluation and
cytogenetic investigations. Furthermore, some studies have shown the importance of
characterizing the genomic position of the critical chromosomal region associated
with CdCs for a better understanding of genotype–phenotype correlations (Wu et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Damasceno
et al., 2016). Network-based approaches may contribute to the
identification of specific genes distributions in a given disease and reveal common
molecular mechanisms among genes affected by the condition. Furthermore, genes
associated with the same illness have been observed to interact with each other more
frequently than expected by chance (Barabási
et al., 2011).

Interaction between SLC6A3 TPPP and CCT5 and Processes related to neuronal
development and function in CdCs
In this study, the constructed networks and topological analysis, such as those
in clusters 1 and 8 (Figures 2 and 4), showed interactions between SLC6A3, TPPP,
and CCT5, genes which are located in the SRO, and interactions between processes
related to neuronal development and function in CdCs. The GO analysis of
clusters 1 and 8 indicated the presence of proteins deleted in hemizygous
individuals in our study that are related to the regulation of glutamatergic and
dopaminergic synaptic transmission, catecholamine uptake involved in synaptic
transmission, and norepinephrine secretion and neurogenesis. Changes in patterns
of neuronal activity modulated by dopamine and noradrenaline in the
cortico-striatal region of the brain are able to influence the emergence of
disturbances, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Del Campo et al., 2011;
Cummins et al.,
2012). Interestingly, ADHD is present in about 70% of children with CdCs
(Nguyen et al.,
2015), and, in our study, hyperactivity was present in five out of the
six subjects (Figure 1). SLC6A3, a dopamine
transporter, regulates extracellular dopamine, is responsible for the reuptake
of dopamine, and functions to balance levels of neuronal dopamine (Gizer et al., 2009).
Deficiency of this protein can lead to the accumulation of dopamine in the
cytosol, with deleterious effects (Sotnikova
et al., 2005). These effects may be associated
with hyperlocomotion, stereotyped behaviors, and hyperactivity, as in
Slc6a3 KO mice (Giros
et al., 1996; Pogorelov et al., 2005; Lohr et al., 2017), or decreased
immobility, as in Slc6a3
+/– mice (Perona et
al., 2008). Therefore, SLC6A3 can be proposed as a good
target on subsequent functional analyses that could increase the mechanistic
knowledge related to those CdCs phenotypes. Interestingly, we observed that TPPP
is among the direct neighbors of SLC6A3 in cluster 8 (Figure 4). TPPP functions in tubulin polymerization and
microtubule stabilization (Vincze et
al., 2006). TPPP plays an important role in pathological
conditions through the co-enrichment and co-localization of TPPP and α-synuclein
in human brain inclusions, such as in Parkinson’s disease (Oláh and Ovádi, 2014). Through the polymerization of the
tubulin polymer, TPPP contributes to the extension of peripheral axons in
sensory neurons (Aoki et al.,
2014). Changes in the expression of TPPP are associated with the
phenotypes of depression and anxiety following early life stress in humans
(Montalvo-Ortiz et al.,
2016). Therefore, these results identified by network analysis
suggest an important perturbation between the proteins SLC6A3 and TPPP
generating neural changes in CdCs individuals. SLC6A3 also interacts with the
H-B CCT5 in cluster 1, in which processes related to cognition, memory, and
learning can be found (Figure 4,
Table S2). The protein CCT5 is involved in
cilia morphogenesis and neurodegenerative processes, and its deficiency may
cause neurodegenerative diseases, such asspastic paraplegia (Bouhouche et al., 2006;
Posokhova et al.,
2011), supporting the GO results. Individuals with spastic paraplegia
may present with atrophy of the spinal cord and defects in the upper limbs.
These results indicate that SLC6A3, CCT5 and TPPP show
important connection. Thus, we could consider that disruption of these
interactions may change the processes related to neuronal development and
function underlying in some patients with CdCs.

Interplay between of genes in the SRO and behavioral and cognitive
impairment
The proteins encoded by CTNND2, TERT, and
MED10, which are located in the SRO determined in this
study (Figure 2), are commonly deleted in
CdCs and interact in several modules associated with neuronal
development/function and cellular death, specifically clusters 3, 5, 6, 8, 10,
and 11 (Tables S4, S5, S6, S7, S9, S11 and S12). This suggests an interplay between
genes in the SRO and behavioral and cognitive impairment. These
genes are expressed during important periods of embryonic and neuronal
development (Yui et al.,
1998; Kwon et al.,
1999; Ho et al.,
2000). CTNND2, considered a bottleneck in our
analysis, encodes δ-catenin, a component of adherens junction complexes (Kosik et al., 2005) that
regulates spine morphogenesis and synapse function in hippocampal neural cells
during development (Arikkath et
al., 2009). δ-Catenin is stabilized by N-cadherin, which
binds to PDZ domain proteins in the post-synaptic compartment at synapse
junctions and regulates spine architecture during hippocampal development and
the differentiation of neurons via downstream effectors that bind to actin in
the cytoskeleton (Kosik et al.,
2005; Yuan et al.,
2015). Among the bioprocesses investigated in the protein interaction
network, we identified the negative regulation of the Wnt receptor signaling
pathway. Through Wnt signaling, δ-catenin prevents Rho GTPase signaling,
modulating the Ras superfamily in cytoskeletal reorganization (Lu et al., 2016).
Perturbations in this pathway, observed after depletion of δ-catenin, may
contribute to functional neurological alterations (Arikkath et al., 2009). In this sense, the
loss of a copy of CTNND2 in CdCs may be associated with
intellectual disability, reading problems (Medina et al., 2000; Belcaro et al., 2015; Hofmeister et al., 2015), learning
difficulties, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Asadollahi et al., 2014) (Figure 1). The interplay of δ-catenin with cadherin suggests
its influence on Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Lu
et al., 2016), which increases keloid cell
proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through its interaction with telomerase
(Yu et al., 2016).
This mechanism perhaps explains the enrichment of the negative regulation of
apoptosis process in the GO analysis (Figure
5). In addition, reduction in MED10 levels enhances Wnt signaling and
is required for the expression of developmentally regulated genes (Kwon et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2007). The H-B
MED10 is crucial for DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA
polymerase II (Sato et al.,
2003). Lastly, the telomerase reverse transcriptase, encoded by
TERT, which behaved as an H-B, was the most clusterized
protein (Tables S15 and
S17). The hemizygosity of
TERT has been associated with shorter telomeres in
lymphocytes from CdCs patients and contributes to the phenotypic changes seen in
the syndrome (Zhang et al.,
2003). However, another study with 52 individuals affected by CdCs
showed that the telomere length in CdCs patients was within the normal range,
though the average was shorter than that in normal controls (Du et al., 2007). These
data suggest that the contribution of TERT to CdCs may involve
alterations in other biological processes or pathways. For instance,
TERT can exert protective effects. Under dietary
restriction conditions, TERT accumulates in the mouse brain, leading to
reductions in free radicals in the mitochondria, DNA damage, and apoptosis
through the inhibition of the mTOR cascade (Miwa
et al., 2016). These processes were present in
all clusters except 1 and 13 (Tables S2 and
S14).

Therefore, analyses of centrality suggest that the deficiency in
CTNND2, TERT, and MED10
genes expression during important stages of development may affect processes
related to neurogenesis and the regulation of apoptosis and DNA repair, being
inherent in the cognitive and behavioral impairments seen in CdC patients (Figure 1).

Control of NF-kB transcription factor/interleukin 1 and inflammatory
response
In several clusters, GO analysis identified processes related to the immune
system and inflammatory response. Considering this, we explored the control of
the NF-κB transcription factor/IL-1 and the inflammatory
response. The appearance of respiratory and intestinal
infections during the first years of life is common in patients with CdCs,
though it has been rarely discussed (Mainardi,
2006). Processes related to immune response-activating signal
transduction, response to IL-1, leukocyte activation, and regulation of the IκB
kinase/NF-κB cascade, which has an important role in inflammation (Deacon and Knox 2018), were observed in our
study, especially in clusters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 (Figure 5, Tables S2 -S4 and S6-S13). With the use of telomerase inhibitors
and telomerase-targeting small interfering RNAs, it has been found that H-B TERT
reduces TNF-α-induced chemokine expression in airway smooth muscle cells (SMCs)
(Deacon and Knox, 2018). Another
protein involved in the immune response is adenylyl cyclase (ADCY2), which is
also an H-B according to the centrality analysis. This protein catalyzes the
formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), involving various signal transduction pathways. ADCY2 regulates the
production of IL-6 in inflammatory processes and enhances its expression in SMCs
(Bogard et al., 2014;
Jajodia et al.,
2016). In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ADCY2 have been
associated with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Hardin et al., 2012).

These data suggest that the presence of specific pathways related to the immune
response can be affected by genes commonly deleted in CdCs (Figure 5). These results bring new insights into the
pathogenesis of the syndrome, in an attempt to explain the emergence of
recurrent respiratory and intestinal infections during the first years of life
in individuals with CdCs (Mainardi,
2006).

Association between genes in SRO and congenital malformations.
Regarding the association between genes in the SRO and the multiple congenital
malformations observed in CdCs, the network analysis demonstrated interactions
between MTRR, CEP72, NDUFS6, MRPL36, and MED10 in clusters 2 and 4, in which the
GO analysis identified processes related to DNA repair, cell cycle control,
cellular death, and mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and electron transport (Figure 5). MTRR encodes a
methionine synthase reductase that is fundamental for the remethylation of
homocysteine, which regenerates functional methionine synthase via reductive
methylation. Individuals with neural tube defects (NTDs) exhibit elevated
homocysteine concentrations (Steegers-Theunissen
et al., 1993; Zhu et al., 2003; Cheng et al., 2015). The protein MTRR emerged as a
bottleneck in our protein interaction network. Heterozygous mutations that lead
to MTRR deficiency have been implicated in homocysteine accumulation, resulting
in adverse reproductive outcomes and congenital heart defects in mice (Zhu et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005).
Therefore, defects in the activity of MTRR could be associated with frequent
clinical manifestations of CdCs, such as cardiac abnormalities. Furthermore,
neurodevelopmental disorders such as primary microcephaly are associated with
mutations in proteins that interact with the centrosomes, such as the CEP72
(Kodani et al.,
2015), which was considered an H-B in our analysis. CEP72 regulates the
localization of centrosomal proteins and bipolar spindle formation (Oshimori et al., 2009).
Therefore, CEP72 is involved in centriole duplication and biological processes
such as control of the cell cycle, and deficiency of this protein may contribute
to dysmorphic phenotypes in CdCs (Figure
1).

Another protein in cluster 2 was the H-B NDUFS6, an accessory subunit of the
mitochondrial chain NADH dehydrogenase (Murray
et al., 2003). Deletion of NDUFS6 or mutation of
its Zn-binding residues blocks a late step in complex I assembly (Kmita et al., 2015).
Mutations in this protein may also cause lethal neonatal mitochondrial complex I
deficiency (Kirby et al.,
2004) and fatal neonatal lactic acidemia (Spiegel et al., 2009). Besides these
proteins, MRPL36, a component of the ribosomal subunit (Williams et al., 2004), emerged as a hub
in our network of protein interactions. Decreases in MRPL36 prevent the correct
folding and assembly of translation products, leading to rapid degradation of
these molecules and defects in the biogenesis of respiratory chain complexes in
the mitochondria (Prestele et
al., 2009). Therefore, the hub MRPL36 may contribute to
oxidative stress-related processes found in cluster 2
(Table S3) and may be associated with excess
apoptosis and NTDs (Yang et
al., 2008).

Excessive apoptosis in fetal central nervous tissues can cause NTDs by decreasing
the number of cells in the neural folds or by physical disruption of the dorsal
midline, consequently resulting in embryonic dysmorphogenesis (Chen et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018).
Furthermore, the H-B MED10, located in clusters 2 (Figure 4), 3, and 4, regulates heart valve formation in zebrafish
(Just et al., 2016).
In addition, network analysis demonstrated an interaction between MED10 and the
protein encoded by MED24/TRAP100, located on chromosome 17.
MED24 is necessary for enteric nervous system development in zebrafish (Pietsch, 2006). Together, these findings
contribute to our understanding of the emergence of congenital heart defects,
microcephaly, and occasional abnormalities such as agenesis of the corpus
callosum, cerebral atrophy, and cerebellar hypoplasia, which may be present in
CdCs.

Conclusion
The possibility of using microarrays to characterize chromosomal rearrangements has
led to several studies aimed at establishing genotype-phenotype correlations in
several contiguous gene deletion syndromes, and some of them have proposed the
regions of susceptibility to each specific condition. However, no consensus has been
reached on the exact identity of the genes and cell signaling pathways involved in
promoting these symptoms, as e.g. in the CdCs. This is the first study to explore
the interaction network of the proteins encoded in the critical region associated
with CdCs by combining cytogenomic data and systems biology tools. This study
identified and demonstrated the biological processes involving genes previously
found to be associated with CdCs, such as TERT,
SLC6A3, and CTDNND2. Furthermore, through
analysis of the protein interaction network, we identified other possible candidate
proteins, including CCT5, TPPP, MED10, ADCY2, MTRR, CEP72, NDUFS6, and MRPL36, with
potential contributions to the phenotypes observed in CdCs. Further functional
analysis of these proteins is required to fully understand their involvement and
interplay in CdCs. Additional research in this direction may confirm those that are
directly involved in the development of the CdCs phenotype and improve
genotype–phenotype correlations.
