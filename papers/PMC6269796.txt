==== Body
1. Introduction
Recently, special attention has been paid to β-amino acids as potential starting materials for bio-organic, medicinal, and natural product chemistry [1]. Nitrogen-containing five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds and their derivatives, which can be easily synthesized in laboratories are particularly important and often found in natural sources. Synthetic thiazole derivatives possess various biological activities such as anti-inflammatory [2,3], antipyretic [4,5], antiviral [6], anti-microbial [7,8,9,10,11], antifungal [12], and anticancer properties [13,14,15,16]. They have also been used as anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics [16], antidepressants [17], in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, hypertension [18], schizophrenia [19], hepatitis C [20], allergies [21,22], HIV [23,24], diabetes [25,26], and in functional dye synthesis [27,28]. The 2-aminothiazole structure provides herbicidal [6,29] and antioxidant activities [30]. One of the most convenient methods of thiazole synthesis is the Hantzsch synthesis, which is based on condensation of α-haloketones or aldehydes with thioamides or thiourea. In our previous studies, N-aryl-N-thiocarbamoyl-β-alanines were used only for the synthesis of 1-substituted 2-thioxotetrahydro-4(1H)-pyrimidinones [31,32,33]. The aim of the present study was to synthesize new potentially biologically active N,N-disubstituted β-amino acids and their derivatives with thiazole, aromatic, heterocyclic fragments and to evaluate their chemical and biological properties.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Synthesis and Structural Peculiarities of New Compounds
3-[(4-Oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)(phenyl)amino]propanoic acid (2) was obtained from N-phenyl-N-thiocarbamoyl-β-alanine (1) and monochloroacetic acid in different solvents (water, acetic acid, DMF, ethanol), and by using different bases such as sodium acetate, sodium carbonate, and triethylamine. Reactions in acetic acid and DMF were carried out at 90–100 °C and in ethanol and water, at the mixture boiling temperature for 5 h.

The studies showed that the best yield was obtained when reactions were carried out in water in the presence of sodium carbonate. Then the reaction mixture was acidified with acetic acid to pH 6. In order to obtain more thiazole derivatives and to assess the influence of substituents on the biological activity, a series of 3-{[5-substituted 4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl](phenyl)amino}propanoic acids 3 with aromatic and heterocyclic fragments was synthesized (Scheme 1) . The syntheses were performed by condensation of dihydrothiazolone 2 and aromatic or heterocyclic aldehydes. Since the starting compound 2 and the resulting products 3 are soluble in an alkaline medium, the reactions were carried out in aqueous sodium carbonate solution in the presence of glycine as a bifunctional catalyst. The target products from the reaction mixtures were separated by acidification of the aqueous solutions with acetic acid to pH 6. The preliminary laboratory tests showed that the compounds 2 and 3 had growth regulating effects for rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) [34]. In the same way, the compound 4 was synthesized from dihydrothiazolone 2 and terephthaldehyde.

The structure of the synthesized compounds 3a–i was confirmed by elemental analysis, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and IR spectral data. For example, in the 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 3a, the CH2CO and NCH2 group proton signals appear at 2.57 and 4.26 ppm, whereas aromatic and CH proton signals are observed in the range of 7.32 to 7.63 ppm. In the 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 3a, the signals of the CH
2CO and NCH2 groups are observed at 34.57 and 51.44 ppm, respectively, whereas aromatic and CH= group carbon signals are observed in the range 111.96–140.42 ppm. The combination of CS, CN, CO, and COOH carbon signals are observed at 133.34, 171.94, 175.79, and 179.19 ppm respectively. In the IR spectrum, the C=N absorption band is observed at 1,540 cm−
1, two C=O bands at 1,686 and 1,725 cm−
1, and a band belonging to the OH group at 3,435 cm−
1 are observed. The formation of isomeric structures in these reactions was not observed. According to data published in the literature, glycine used as a bifunctional catalyst gives a single isomer (Z) [35].

3-[Phenyl(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)amino]propanoic acid (5) was synthesized from compound 1 and chloroacetaldehyde in refluxing water solution after 2 hours. A water-soluble amino acid hydrochloride is formed, which is present in the base transferred by the addition of sodium acetate to the reaction mixture. The structure of compound 5 is confirmed by its NMR spectral data: in the 1H-NMR spectrum two triplets at 2.62 and 4.11 ppm are assigned to the CH2CO and NCH2 group protons, while two doublets at 6.71 and 7.18 ppm belong to the thiazole ring and the SCH NCH group protons. Aromatic ring proton signals are observed at 7.31–7.50 ppm, and broad proton singlets of the carboxyl group are detectable at 12.30 ppm.

Reactions of 1 with various haloketones were also performed, and a number of new thiazole derivatives 6–11 with aliphatic, aromatic, or heterocyclic substituents were thus synthesized. The compounds 6–10 were synthesized in acetone or 2-propanol at boiling temperature. Cyclic diketones—quinones—are interesting both for their chemical properties and practical uses. Besides, many compounds containing the quinone group are found in Nature. Various assays showed that these compounds are characterized by a broad spectrum of biological activities [36]. A quinone fragment- containing compound 11 in this work was synthesized from N-phenyl-N-thiocarbamoyl-β-alanine (1) and 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone. The reaction was carried out in acetic acid at 80 °C for 24 h in the presence of sodium acetate. Then the mixture was cooled and diluted with water. The synthesized 3-(N-(4,9-dihydro-4,9-dioxonaphtho[2,3-d]thiazol-2-yl)-N-phenylamino)propanoic acid (11) was purified by dissolving it in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, filtering, and then acidifying the filtrate with acetic acid to pH 6.

The compound 8 was modified by introducing a hydrazone fragment into its molecule with the porpose of increasing its antimicrobial properties (Scheme 2). Firstly, acid 8 was esterified with methanol to obtain the corresponding ester 12, which afterwards was boiled in 2-propanol with hydrazine monohydrate. The resulting acid hydrazide 13 was condensed with aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes. The NMR spectra of the synthesized hydrazones 14 showed that in DMSO-d
6 solution they exist as a mixture of E/Z isomers due the presence of a CO-NH fragment in the molecule and its hindered rotation around the CO-NH bond; however, the Z isomer was dominant.

The minimum bactericidal values (MBC) are presented in Table 2. These data also revealed pronounced inhibitory activity of some synthesized compounds against some bacteria species, particulalry S. aureus and B. cereus at 250 µg/mL. For instance, the lowest MBC values (250–500 µg/mL) were found for the compounds 3i, 3g, 11. However, the compounds 2, 3h, 5 didn’t show any bactericidal activity against the tested microorganisms.

Among the all synthesized compounds, the highest antibacterial activity was exhibited by thiazole compound 11 containing a naphthoquinone ring. Among compounds 3a–i, the highest antibacterial activity was shown by the compounds with furan and bromothiophene substituents in their structure. Aromatic substituents with different groups (NO2, F, Cl) didn’t show any inhibiting effect. Among thiazole compounds 5–9, the highest antibacterial activity was exhibited by compound 8 with a phenyl substituent in the 4-position of the thiazole ring.

Attempting to increase antimicrobial activity the structure of compound 8 was modified by replacing the carboxy group by hydrazone and hydrazide derivatives with aromatic and heterocyclic substituents, however, the results obtained suggest that modification of the carboxy group decreases the antimicrobial activity.

It may thus be concluded that the antimicrobial activity of the tested compounds depends on their structural peculiarities. 3-(N-(4,9-dihydro-4,9-dioxonaphtho[2,3-d]thiazol-2-yl)-N-phenylamino)propanoic acid (11), 3-(N-(5-((furan-2-yl)methylene)-4,5-dihydro-4-oxothiazol-2-yl)-N-phenylamino)propanoic acid (3g), and 3-(N-(5-((5-bromothiophen-2-yl)methylene)-4,5-dihydro-4-oxothiazol-2-yl)-N-phenyl- amino)propanoic acid (3i) were found to exhibit a promising antibacterial activity.

2.3. Evaluation of Synthesized Compounds on Rapeseed Yield and Biochemical Content
The effect of 3-[(4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)(phenyl)amino]propanoic acid (2) on the rapeseed yield and biochemical content is presented in Table 3. When rapeseed seedlings were sprayed with solutions of 2 of various concentrations, the yield of seeds ranged from 2.07 to 2.44 t/ha, i.e., 19%–40% higher in comparison with the control sample. The highest seed yield was obtained when rapeseed seedlings were sprayed with 150 mg/L of the test compound solution. Other quality characteristics were also affected by spraying rapeseed seedlings with the test compound; for instance, the highest mass of 1,000 seeds (4.17 g) was determined when 25 mg/L were applied, whereas at the same concentration the oil content increased by 13.3%–39.3% in comparison with the control sample.

Application of 3-[(4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)(phenyl)amino]propanoic acid (2) increased both the content of oil and protein. The highest content of oil (334 kg/t) and protein (31.2 mg/100g) was obtained upon using the 75 mg/L concentration of the study compound solution. The content of protein varied from 15.9 to 31.2 mg/100 g. When rapeseed seedlings were sprayed with 75 mg/L of the test compound solution, protein content was two times higher in comparison with the control sample.

The effect of 3-[(4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)(phenyl)amino]propanoic acid (2) on the composition of fatty acids in rapeseed is presented in Table 4. The results showed that the variation of oleic acid content was insignificant (−0.09 to +0.77%) in comparison with the control sample. When rapeseed had been sprayed with 50 mg/L of the aforementioned solution, the highest content of oleic acid (61.51%) was obtained in the seeds. The content of saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic) varied insignificantly in comparison with the control sample. When rapeseed had been sprayed with the test compound solutions at various concentrations, some increase in the content of linolenic acid was observed; however, it was insignificant. Upon spraying rapeseed seedlings with 75 mg/L of the study compound solution, the highest content of linoleic acid (20.96%) was obtained in the seeds.

Summarizing the data of the field experiments spraying rapeseed seedlings with different concentrations of 3-[(4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)(phenyl)amino]propanoic acid (2) solutions resulted in the following:
(a) 100 mg/L: the highest number of pods and siliques was obtained;

(c) 25 mg/L: the highest seed mass was obtained.




During osmotic stress plants accumulate in the cytoplasm of their cells organic osmolytes such as proline, valine, isoleucine, ectoine, aspartic acid, betaine, glucose, fructose, sucrose, fructans, mannitol, pinitol, and myo-inositol (inositol) [37]. The regulating effect of compound 2 on rapeseed could be explained by the properties of typical structure osmolytes: they could exist in the zwitterionic form (Scheme 3).

The methods used to follow the reactions were TLC and NMR. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova (300 MHz) spectrometer (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) and Bruker Avance III/400 (400 MHz). Chemical shifts are expressed as δ, ppm relative to TMS. The J constants are given in Hz. The IR spectra (ν, cm−1) were recorded on a Perkin–Elmer BX FT–IR spectrometer (Perkin–Elmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) using KBr tablets. Mass spectra were obtained on a Waters ZQ 2000 spectrometer (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) using the electrospray ionization (ESI) mode and operating at 25 V. Elemental analyses were performed with a CE-440 elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical Inc., Chelmsford, MA, USA). Melting points were determined with a B-540 Melting Point Analyzer (Büchi Corporation, New Castle, DE, USA) and are uncorrected.

3.4. Antimicrobial Activity
The following bacteria strains were used: gram-negative rods of Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NCTC 6750), gram-positive cocci of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144) and gram-positive spore forming rods of Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778). Tryptic soy agar (TSA) and tryptic soy broth (TSB) were used for bacteria cultivation and antibacterial activity tests.

Antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined by testing their different concentrations against B. cereus, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. coli bacteria by the broth-dilution and spread plate methods [39,40]. A range of concentrations, 1000, 500, 350, 250, and 125 µg/mL were prepared for each sample. They were streaked out on TSA plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A representative colony was placed in 5 mL of TBS and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.


B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa cultures containing 108 CFU/mL (colony-forming units corresponding to McFarland’s 0.5) were diluted with TSB and used for the antibacterial test. The test organisms (100 µL) were added to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. At the end of this period, a small amount of the diluted mixture (different materials) from each tube was pulled out and spread on TSA. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The growth of bacterial cells was observed on agar plates. The lowest concentration of the bacterial material at which no growth was observed was considered as the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) value [41]. The antibacterial compound oxytetracycline inoculated with each test bacterium in the tubes and plates was used as a control. The growth of the test bacteria was observed in all plates as positive controls.

3.5. Field Trials and Rapeseed Biochemical Ontent
The influence of N-substituted β-alanine derivatives on the growth of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and St. John wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) in vitro was explored. According to the results, 3-[(4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)(phenyl)amino]propanoic acid (2) was selected, because it had the most remarkable positive effect on the growth of rapeseed and St. John wort in vitro [34]. Following the data obtained during the in vitro experiments, compound 2 was selected for the field trials.

Experiments with 3-[(4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)(phenyl)amino]propanoic acid on spring rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) of the SW Landmark variety were carried out in field trials in 2012 at the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry branch Rumokai experimental station. Spring rapeseed was sprayed with the study compound solutions (concentrations 25–150 mg/L) before flowering. For each field, 1 L of the solution was used. The soil of the experimental field was carbonaceous shallow luvisols (Calc or epihypogleyic luvisol IDg8-k (LVg-w-cc) with the following charateristics: pHKCl 6.7, humus 1.82%, Ntotal 0.12%, 308 mg kg−1 of mobile P2O5, 296 mg kg−1 of mobile K2O. Soil samples were collected on 25.04.2012. Barley was the preceding crop. The size of the initial and accounted fields was 2.7 × 11 m and 2.2 × 10 m, respectively. Experiments with rapeseed were performed in April–August. The average air temperature ranged from 7.9 to 19.3 °C, the rainfall ranged from 44.4 to 118.4 mm per month, and during the experiment it was 361.1 mm. The rainfall was by 11.1 mm higher than the average multi-annual precipitation. Biometric measurements were carried out after harvesting. The moisture of rape seeds was 8.5%. The oil content in rape seeds was measured by extraction with hexane for 3 hours in a Soxhlet apparatus (Behr Labor-Technik, Dusseldorf, Germany). Fatty acid composition was analysed with a HRGC 5300 Mega Series gas chromatograph Carlo Erba Strumentazione (Milano, Italy). The protein content in rape seeds was measured by the Bradford method.

4. Conclusions
The N-phenyl-N-thiocarbamoyl-β-alanine was used for the first time for the synthesis of biologically active 2-aminothiazole derivatives. By a new method of synthesizing the target structures we have established a convenient way to produce a number of compounds, which were used for biological testing. Some of the synthesized compounds exhibited promising antimicrobial activity, and 3-[(4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)(phenyl)amino]propanoic acid (2) was found to promote the growth, to increase seed yield and oil content in rapeseed.
