on remote effects within connected networks, frequently extending into the
contralesional hemisphere. However, the pattern of large-scale contralesional
network remodeling remains largely unresolved. In this study, we applied
diffusion-based tractography and graph-based network analysis to measure
structural connectivity in the contralesional hemisphere chronically after
experimental stroke in rats. We used the minimum spanning tree method, which
accounts for variations in network density, for unbiased characterization of
network backbones that form the strongest connections in a network.
Ultrahigh-resolution diffusion MRI scans of eight post-mortem rat brains
collected 70 days after right-sided stroke were compared against scans from 10
control brains. Structural network backbones of the left (contralesional)
hemisphere, derived from 42 atlas-based anatomical regions, were found to be
relatively stable across stroke and control animals. However, several
sensorimotor regions showed increased connection strength after stroke.
Sensorimotor function correlated with specific contralesional sensorimotor
network backbone measures of global integration and efficiency. Our findings
point toward post-stroke adaptive reorganization of the contralesional
sensorimotor network with recruitment of distinct sensorimotor regions, possibly
through strengthening of connections, which may contribute to functional
recovery.

==== Body
Introduction
Stroke regularly results in loss of motor function and is one of the main causes of
disability in adults worldwide. Nevertheless, most patients experience partial
recovery of sensorimotor function in the weeks and months following the stroke,
which is believed to be associated with reorganization of surviving neural networks.1 This provides opportunities for recovery-promoting therapies that target
intrinsic neurorestorative mechanisms.

Post-stroke brain reorganization manifests from micro- (e.g. synaptic plasticity) to
macroscale (e.g. cortical remapping). Various studies have revealed local
microstructural reorganization around brain lesions after stroke, including
dendritic branching, synaptogenesis and neurite outgrowth, which affect networks of
neuronal connections at a larger scale.2–4 Post-stroke structural
remodeling is not limited to perilesional sites and may also extend to the
contralesional hemisphere, as has been demonstrated in animal stroke
models5–8 and human stroke
patients.9–15 Contralesional structural
alterations may be particularly prominent in regions that are homologous to the
ipsilesional stroke-affected regions10,12,15, and could thereby contribute
to partial retrieval of acute stroke-induced loss of specific function.9–11,14,15 However, the pattern of
remodeling of contralesional neuronal circuitry, particularly at meso- and
macroscale, remains largely unresolved.

Post-stroke large-scale neural network alterations can be assessed with neuroimaging
techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which offer powerful means to
map structural and functional networks non-invasively in animal models and
patients.1,16 Today, the gold standard neuroimaging technique to characterize
whole-brain structural connectivity in vivo is diffusion-based
tractography.17,18 Diffusion imaging characterizes the degree and directionality
of tissue water diffusion, which informs on the underlying tissue architecture –
particularly the arrangement of axonal projections – and allows three-dimensional
tracking of neuronal fibers.18 A growing amount of data has demonstrated that diffusion-based tractography
may inform on alterations in structural brain connectivity after stroke, possibly
associated with neuroplasticity.10,14,15 However, to our knowledge, so
far only one diffusion-based tractography study has reported on contralesional
remodeling of network connectivity in stroke patients.10

Neural network features are frequently quantified with graph analysis based on nodes
(e.g. predefined brain regions) and edges (e.g. connecting fiber tracts).19–22 However, graph-based
comparison of networks with different edge densities and connectivity distributions
remains challenging.23,24 Since focal brain injury typically results in less dense
structural networks with fewer connected node pairs, alternative network analysis
strategies that are not influenced by variations in network size and density could
be more appropriate for the characterization of reorganizing networks after stroke.
A promising approach is assessment of the network backbone with minimum spanning
tree (MST) analysis, which involves a sub-graph of the original network comprising
the strongest network connections.25–27 Backbone analysis enables
unbiased comparison of networks irrespective of differences in density and
connectivity distributions, and has been successfully applied to capture network
changes during brain development and in brain disorders such as epilepsy, multiple
sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, brain tumors and schizophrenia.25,26,28–32

In the present study, we aimed to identify macroscale alterations in structural
network connectivity and organization in the contralesional hemisphere chronically
after experimental stroke. To that aim we acquired diffusion MRI data of post-mortem
brains from healthy control rats and from rats with sensorimotor deficits after
unilateral stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. Post-mortem imaging
allows very long scanning times, enabling acquisition of images with ultrahigh
spatial resolution and great structural detail, not feasible under in vivo
conditions. We measured white matter volume and integrity in the contralesional
hemisphere, and analyzed backbones of diffusion tractography-based structural
networks in relation to sensorimotor performance.

Methods
Stroke model, sensorimotor function and in vivo MRI
Ethical approval was given by the Animal Experiments Committee of the University
Medical Center Utrecht and the Utrecht University, and experiments were
performed in accordance with the guidelines of the European Communities Council
Directive.

Eighteen adult male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing 280–320 g, were included in the
study. Eight rats underwent transient focal cerebral ischemia by 90-min
intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, as previously
described.33,34 Ten rats served as age-matched controls. Behavioral data
and in vivo functional MRI data from these animals have been reported previously.34

All rats were trained at four and three days before stroke, and behaviorally
tested at 2 days before and at 3, 7, 21, 49, and 70 days after stroke. A
sensorimotor deficit score was acquired through grading on different subscales
of ‘motility, spontaneous activity’ (e.g. moving limbs without proceeding),
‘gait disturbances’ (e.g. walking toward contralateral side), ‘postural signs’
(e.g. forelimb flexion) and ‘limb placing’ (e.g. normal, weak or no placing).35 The total sensorimotor deficit score had a range of 0 (i.e. no deficit)
to 20 (i.e. maximal deficit) points.

Infarction size and location were assessed at 70 days after stroke on a 4.7T
Varian MR scanner with T2-weighted MRI (multiple spin echo;
repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 3000/17.5 ms; echo train length = 8; field
of view = 32 × 32 mm2; matrix =128 × 128; 19 coronal slices; slice
thickness = 1 mm). Quantitative T2 maps were computed as previously described.34 Stroke lesions characterized by T2 prolongation and tissue
liquefaction were manually outlined on T2 maps by two independent
neuroscientists, and the overlapping area was assigned as infarcted tissue.

Post mortem anatomical and diffusion MRI
Stroke and control rats were euthanized at day 70 and transcardially perfused
with phosphate-buffered saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. After one year of
storage in paraformaldehyde, post mortem brains were fixated in a syringe filled
with proton-free perfluoropolyether (Fomblin®, Solvay Solexis) to prevent
magnetic susceptibility artifacts around the borders of the brain, which
facilitates image post-processing.

High angular resolution diffusion imaging of post mortem rat brain was conducted
on a 9.4T Varian MR scanner (eight-shot EPI; TR/TE = 6000/32 ms;
FOV = 25 × 25 mm2; acquisition matrix = 128 × 128; zero-filled to
256 × 256; 91 coronal slices with slice thickness of 0.2 mm; isotropic voxel
resolution =0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3; 4 images without
diffusion-weighting; diffusion-weighted images in 2 sets of 60 directions
equally spaced on a sphere with b = 2871.50 s/mm2 in opposite
gradient directions (Δ/δ = 13/6 ms); total acquisition
time = 13.25 h/dataset).

Image processing
Images were pre-processed with FSL 5.0 (http://ww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/).36 The image processing pipeline as described below is pictured in Figure 1. For each
dataset, whole-brain fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were linearly and
nonlinearly matched with a custom-built 3D reconstruction of the Paxinos and
Watson rat brain atlas,37 using affine and nonlinear registrations (FLIRT/FNIRT).38,39 FA maps
were determined from the diffusion tensor. The contralesional hemisphere was
partitioned in 42 cortical and subcortical network regions based on standard
anatomical atlas boundaries (see Figure 1) and projected in subject space.
Anatomical region details are given in Table 1. A mask that only covered the
contralesional hemisphere was created using the R package
oro.nifti [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oro.nifti/index.html].
This R package provides functions for the input, output and visualization of
medical imaging data that follow standard imaging formats. Tractography was done
in subject space within the contralesional hemisphere mask. Figure 1. Image processing pipeline. A schematic overview of the image
processing steps. After registration with the Paxinos and Watson rat
brain atlas, 42 unilateral brain regions were resampled in subject
space and used to extract weighted structural networks from
diffusion-based tractography in the contralesional hemisphere. A
minimum spanning tree (MST) was extracted from the weighted networks
and quantified using MST metrics. Atlas labels are plotted on top of
a grayscale image of a transverse rat brain slice (first picture).
Color-coded contralesional fiber tracts are shown for a single
subject (>5 mm tract length only; approximate lesion site
depicted in yellow) (second picture). Magnified illustrations

(third picture), and corresponding MST (MST leaf nodes in orange)
(fourth picture).

Anatomical characteristics
A white matter mask was constructed using an FA threshold of 0.2 (i.e. all voxels
with a subthreshold value were regarded as grey matter). We determined white and
grey matter volumes of the contralesional hemisphere. For white matter voxels,
we determined the mean FA, radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity
(AD).

Diffusion tensor-based tractography
Diffusion-based tractography and subsequent connectome reconstructions were
performed in MRtrix3® (http://www.mrtrix.org/).40 We used diffusion tensor-based tractography to reconstruct whole brain
white matter fiber connections on a voxel-wise basis from the diffusion MRI
data.18,41 Seeds were equally distributed over the whole
contralesional hemisphere, from which tracts were generated using a
voxel-by-voxel stepwise approach following the principal diffusion directions.
Based on our previous work,42 we selected tractography parameter settings that yield highest
specificity for reconstruction of intrahemispheric connections as suggested for
network analyses.43 We used an FA threshold of 0.15 (i.e. tract generation was terminated in
sub-threshold voxels), a step-size of 130 µm, an angular threshold of 20° (i.e.
tracts were terminated when bending with an angle exceeding the threshold) and
25 k streamlines. The relative low FA threshold allowed for optimal tract
termination within the cortical gray matter regions.

We used spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT) to
improve the accuracy of reconstructed sets of white matter bundles by optimizing
and fitting them to the underlying diffusion-weighted images.44,45 Thereby,
the number of tracts is normalized and corrected for density differences across
different regions and datasets.

Structural network reconstruction
Structural connectivity was determined for each pair of atlas regions. Two
regions were considered connected if one or more filtered tracts had their end
point in both regions. These were subsequently used to construct a weighted
network, represented by the graph S = (N,
W) where N is the set of 42 unilateral
network regions and W = wij is the
N × N weight matrix, where
wij is set to the SIFT-corrected number of
all tracts connecting the region pairs. Self-connections were excluded. The
filtered number of tracts was used as a measure of connectivity strength. The
density of undirected networks, with no self-connections, was defined as the
ratio of the number of existing edges over the total possible number of edges
(that is, N × (N – 1)/2)).

Weighted connectivity matrices were formed for 42 × 42 atlas regions. To examine
inter-subject consistency of connections, group-based average structural
networks were generated from the prevalence of connections (after binarization
of individual network matrices (i.e. all connection weights were set to a value
of one)) within the control and stroke group.

Sensorimotor network reconstruction
We extracted 15 sensorimotor regions from the acquired structural network
matrices, i.e. the primary motor cortex (M1), secondary motor cortex (M2),
caudate putamen, thalamus, globus pallidus, sub-regions of the primary
somatosensory cortex (S1) (i.e. forelimb region, oral dysgranular zone, upper
lip region, shoulder region, hindlimb region, dysgranular zone, trunk region,
barrel field, jaw region and S1 not otherwise specified) and secondary
somatosensory cortex (S2). Sensorimotor connectivity matrices were formed from
16 × 16 unilateral sensorimotor regions.

MST analysis
For all rats’ graphs G, the MST was calculated using the
Prim–Jarník algorithm. Every graph G has a set of nodes
N, an edges set W and a real valued cost
ℓ w assigned to each edge w∈W, i.e. the connectivity cost is the inversed edge weight along
the connection. A spanning tree, defined as subset of the network nodes forming
graph G which connects all nodes and does not contain any
cycles or loops,27 was computed for all unilateral (contralesional) structural network
reconstructions. A MST T minimizes the sum of the costs of its
edges, ℓ(T)=∑w∈Tℓw over the set of all possible MSTs on G.46 Group-based MST connectivity matrices were generated from the prevalence
of MST connections (after binarization of individual MST network matrices) for
the control and stroke groups.

The following metrics were calculated for the MSTs at nodal or network level:
Betweenness centrality (nodal): an often used
network measure of hubness,21 which is based on the number of shortest paths passing
through a node. Betweenness centrality of a node increases with the
number of those passages and is defined as bci=1(n-1)(n-2)∑j≠k,k≠i,j≠ingjk(i)gjk where gjk is the shortest path between two nodes of the MST
and gjk(i) is the number of node paths that pass actually
through node i.

Strength (nodal): the tree node strength is a
summation of all nodal connection weights.21,47

Leaf number (Nleaf) (network): the number
of tree nodes having exactly one connection to another tree node. A
higher leaf number reflects increased global network integration and
efficiency.25,26

Diameter (d) (network): the largest distance between
any two nodes of the tree, ranging from 2 to
M = N – 1, where
M is the number of connections in the tree. The
largest possible diameter decreases with increasing leaf number
Nleaf (i.e. improved network
integration or global efficiency).25,26

Eccentricity (network): the shortest path length
between a tree node I and any other node from the
tree. Eccentricity decreases when nodes become more central in the
tree.25,26

Kappa (network): width of degree distribution:
Κ = <
k2 > / < k > .25
This measure reflects the vulnerability to hub-node damage. Networks
characterized with a scale-free degree distribution,48 e.g. neural networks, have particularly high Kappa
values.



Contralesional network backbone metrics versus lesion size and sensorimotor
outcome
We related network backbone characteristics to lesion size and sensorimotor
deficit score at day 70, using univariable linear regression. A
p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Software
Network analyses, statistical modelling and generation of some figures were
performed in R 3.2 (http://www.r-project.org/)
using the packages igraph, reshape2, network, lattice,
oro.nifit, plyr, sna, lm and ggplot2.

Results
Post mortem anatomical and diffusion MRI data
Post-mortem MRI 10 weeks after stroke (N = 8) displayed ischemic lesions in the
subcortical and cortical MCA territory (Figure 2, top row). Mean lesion volume
was 264 ± 72 mm3. Individual lesion volumes are shown in Table S1.

control and post-stroke rat brain slice (T2-weighted and
diffusion MRI sequences are described in the Methods section). The
unilateral ischemic lesion area is depicted by a red overlay in the
anatomical image and delineated by a white line in the tractogram.
Loss of fiber connections is clearly visible in the ipsilesional
hemisphere of stroke animals. In the contralesional hemisphere,
fiber density was comparable to that in controls.



We found no significant change in volumes of the contralesional white matter,
gray matter or total hemisphere of stroke animals as compared to controls (Table 2). Furthermore
contralesional white matter FA, RD and AD values were not significantly
different from control values (Table 2). Table 2. Gray and white matter characteristics for control and stroke
animals.

Figure 2 (bottom row)
shows representative examples of tractography-based structural connectome
reconstructions of control and post-stroke rat brain. Loss of fiber connections
is clearly visible in the ipsilesional hemisphere where the lesion area is
characterized by complete absence of fibers. In the contralesional hemisphere of
stroke animals, fiber density was slightly (1.1 ± 0.01 %) higher than in control
animals (t = 2.05, p = 0.06).

Group-based structural network and MST connectivity matrices
Figure 3 shows
group-based average connectivity matrices for the total structural network and
the network backbones (MST) for the left (contralesional) hemisphere of stroke
and control animals (see Figure S1 for representative examples of individual
weighted networks and corresponding backbones). Some structural connections are
highly stable (high prevalence), whereas existence of other connections varies
across individual animals (low prevalence). The MSTs, reflecting the backbone
connections, primarily consisted of connections between sensorimotor regions,
such as the primary motor cortex, the secondary motor cortex, caudate putamen
and the forelimb and hindlimb regions of the primary somatosensory cortex.
Overall, the connectivity pattern in the contralesional hemisphere of stroke
animals was quite similar to its counterpart in control animals. However, subtle
differences were apparent in the connectivity matrices. For example in the
caudate putamen, which revealed connections with the ventral area of the
secondary auditory cortex and the primary auditory cortex in the stroke group
but not in the control group. Also, for the backbone connections, we observed
connections (e.g. between the upper lip region and jaw region of the primary
somatosensory cortex or between the secondary motor cortex and piriform cortex)
in the stroke group that were not apparent in controls. However, no significant
differences in group-based average network backbone characteristics were found
between the left, contralesional hemisphere in stroke animals and the left
hemisphere in control animals (Figure S2). Figure 3. Average connectivity matrices for the total networks and minimum
spanning trees. Average structural connectivity matrices of total
networks (left) and MST backbones (right) of the left

animals. Connectivity weights are based on prevalence of connections
for each group, ranging from low (white) to high (red). ‘le_[Name]’
indicates node in left (contra-lesional) hemisphere. The MSTs,
reflecting the backbone connections, primarily consisted of
connections between sensorimotor regions, such as the primary motor
cortex, the secondary motor cortex, caudate putamen and the forelimb
and hindlimb regions of the primary somatosensory cortex. Overall,
the connectivity pattern in the contralesional hemisphere of stroke
animals was quite similar to its counterpart in control animals,
although some subtle differences are apparent in the connectivity
matrices.



Nodal MST metrics
Figure 4 (left) shows the
ranking of individual node strengths measured from MSTs from the individual
control and stroke animals. The caudate putamen and hippocampus were the
strongest connected nodes in control as well as stroke animals. The upper lip
and jaw region of the primary somatosensory cortex displayed considerable
modifications, i.e. increased node strength (Figure 4) and degree (Figure S3), in
stroke animals. Figure 4. Node strengths and betweenness centralities from individual networks.
Node strength (left) and betweenness centrality (right)
(mean ± standard deviation) – calculated from MSTs of the left
(contralesional) hemisphere in individual control and stroke animals
– ranked from high to low (based on control group data). ‘le_[Name]’
indicates brain atlas region in left (contralesional) hemisphere.
Red bars represent sensorimotor regions. The caudate putamen and
hippocampus were the strongest connected nodes in control as well as
stroke animals. The upper lip and jaw region of the primary
somatosensory cortex displayed considerable modifications, i.e.
increased node strength in stroke animals. The caudate putamen, the
hippocampus, the primary motor cortex and the secondary motor cortex
were the four most significant hub-nodes, for control as well as
stroke animals. Some regions displayed increased (e.g. the upper lip
and jaw regions of the primary somatosensory cortex) or decreased
betweenness centrality (e.g. the pre-limbic cortex) after
stroke.



Ranking of individual node betweenness centralities (i.e. hubness) (Figure 4, right) showed
that the caudate putamen, the hippocampus, the primary motor cortex and the
secondary motor cortex were the four most significant hub-nodes, for control as
well as stroke animals. Nevertheless, some regions displayed increased (e.g. the
upper lip and jaw regions of the primary somatosensory cortex) or decreased
betweenness centrality (e.g. the pre-limbic cortex) after stroke.

Network backbone metrics versus lesion size and functional outcome
Linear regression revealed no trends or significant association between
contralesional network backbone metrics at post-stroke day 70 and lesion volume
(Figure S4). Also, sensorimotor deficit score at day 70 (shown in Table S1) was
not significantly correlated with MST backbone characteristics of the total
structural network (Figure
5, left). However, sensorimotor deficit score was positively
associated with eccentricity (p = 0.02) and average betweenness
centrality (p = 0.08) of the specific MST from the
contralesional sensorimotor network (Figure 5, right). Figure 5. Contralesional backbone metrics versus sensorimotor deficit score.

significantly correlated with MST backbone characteristics of the

network.



Discussion
To characterize the configuration of structural network backbones in the
contralesional hemisphere chronically after stroke, we analyzed high-resolution
post-mortem MRI data of rat brains collected at 70 days after unilateral stroke.
Structural backbones, assessed with an unbiased network analysis approach based on
MSTs, were relatively consistent across control and stroke animals, but
modifications in nodal importance of specific sensorimotor network regions were
apparent in post-stroke brains. Furthermore, we found that sensorimotor outcome was
associated with backbone metrics related to network efficiency.

Changes in the organization of neural networks in the contralesional hemisphere after
stroke may reflect remote tissue degeneration as well as remote tissue plasticity in
response to focal ischemic injury.1–4,10,16,49 In our study, we measured an
increase in connectivity strength and hubness of certain contralesional sensorimotor
regions (e.g. upper lip and jaw regions of the primary somatosensory cortex) in
brains from rats that were sacrificed at a plateau stage of sensorimotor recovery
after stroke. These findings suggest adaptive reorganization of the contralesional
sensorimotor network with recruitment of distinct sensorimotor regions, possibly
through strengthening or formation of connections. This corresponds with our
previous findings of enhanced in vivo functional connectivity (part of which
measured in the same group of stroke animals34) and stronger neuroanatomical connectivity between contralesional sensory and
motor regions.34,50 In the current study, the observed increased consistency,
strength and hubness of network backbone regions in stroke animals may particularly
denote strengthening of existing connections. In an earlier diffusion MRI study in
which network communicability was measured chronic stroke patients, several regions
with increased communicability were identified in the contralesional hemisphere.10 Yet, contralesional regions with decreased communicability were also
observed, which may be related to secondary degeneration of transhemispheric white
matter pathways.14 However, diffusion MRI data from our study in rats did not reveal significant
changes in white matter volume or integrity in the contralesional hemisphere.

Sensorimotor outcome at day 70 was negatively associated with eccentricity and
average betweenness centrality of specifically the sensorimotor part of the
contralesional network backbone (no significant correlation was found for the
backbone of total contralesional network). This implies that low integration and
global efficiency (i.e. high network eccentricity), and strong reliance on highly
connected nodes (i.e. high average betweenness centrality) in the contralesional
sensorimotor network may impede recovery of sensorimotor function after stroke,
which would further emphasize the importance of efficient (modified) network
functioning in the contralesional hemisphere of recovering stroke patients.

Despite the potential of network backbone analysis for reliable and robust assessment
of the strongest and most important connections, we cannot draw conclusions about
the contribution of other structural connections that may have played a role in
network remodeling in our study. Furthermore, although our post mortem dataset
offered high-quality reconstruction of structural connections, it was limited to a
single chronic time-point after stroke, which did not allow us to look into earlier
structural network changes when functional recovery is particularly ongoing, i.e. in
the first weeks after stroke. Nevertheless, our study shows that modifications in
structural network backbones at meso- to macroscale level can be identified from
high-resolution diffusion-based tractography in rat brain. We measured alterations
in MST metrics in the contralesional hemisphere chronically after stroke, which we
could relate to the degree of functional outcome.

The relative voxel size as compared to total rat brain volume (8 × 10−3
mm3/900 mm3) in our post mortem study, is comparable to
that of in vivo DTI studies in humans (8–27 mm3/1500 × 103
mm3). It would be valuable, for translational purposes, to assess
structural network backbone configurations with DTI in stroke patients. Furthermore,
longitudinal studies could help to resolve the temporal pattern of structural
network alterations in relation to loss and recovery of functions. Alternative
network methods, based on generative models, may be employed to further elucidate
structural repair mechanisms in post-stroke brain at whole-connectome level. These
include Bayesian exponential random graph models,51,52 or mixed-effect models53 and Gibbs distribution models54, which also allow comparison of networks with different densities. Insights
from these studies may aid in the development and selection of new treatment
strategies for patients recovering from stroke.
