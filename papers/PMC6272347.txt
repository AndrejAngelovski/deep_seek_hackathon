1. Introduction
The thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives occupy special place and have attracted considerable attention because of their broad pharmacological activities, including anticancer [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], antiviral [10,11,12,13], anti-inflammatory [14,15,16,17], antimicrobial [18,19], antidiabetic [20,21,22,23], antihypertensive [24,25,26] and osteogenic [27,28] activities, in addition to treatment of CNS disorders [29,30,31]. Also, pyridine derivatives of different heterocyclic nucleus have shown potent pharmacological properties like antifungal [32,33], antitubercular [34], antibacterial [35], antimicrobial [36], insecticida [37]. In view of these findings and in continuation to our previous work [38,39,40,41,42,43], we report here the convenient synthesis of some new thieno[2,3-b]pyridines, pyrimidino[4',5':4,5]thieno[2,3-b]pyridines and pyridines incorporating 5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl moiety.

2. Results and Discussion
Treatment of sodium 3-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-olate (1) [44] with each of cyanothioacetamide or 2-cyanoacetohydrazide in piperidinium acetate under refluxed to give 6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-2-thioxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carbonitrile (2) and 1-amino-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-pyridine-3-carbonitrile (3), respectively in a good yield (Scheme 1). Structure 2 was elucidated by elemental analysis, spectra, and chemical transformation. 6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-2-thioxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carbonitrile (2) was reacted with chloroacetone in N,N-dimethylformamide containing potassium hydroxide to afford the product corresponding to addition and dehydrochlorination reactions. The IR spectrum of this product showed bands at 2218 and 1700 cm−1 corresponding to CN and CO groups. Its 1H-NMR spectrum revealed the signals at δ 2.39 (s, 3H, CH3), 4.38 (s, 2H, SCH2) and 7.23–7.97 (m, 6H, ArH’s). Based on these data, these reaction products could be formulated as 2-(2-oxopropylthio)-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)pyridine-3-carbonitrile (5a). Further confirmation of the structure of 5a arose from their cyclization in boiling ethanol containing a catalytic amount of piperidine to give the corresponding 1-(3-amino-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridin-2-yl)ethanone (6a) (Scheme 1). The IR spectrum of 6a showed no band of the CN function but the bands at 3274, 3174 (NH2 group). 1H-NMR spectrum of 6a revealed an absence of signals of the -SCH2- group and the presence of the NH2 protons. These findings proved that the CN and the -SCH2- groups were both involved in the cyclization step leading to 6a.

Also, 2 was reacted with each ω-bromoacetophenone and idomethane in N,N-dimethylformamide containing potassium hydroxide to afford 6-(5-bromo-benzofuran-2-yl)-2-(2-oxo-2-phenyl-ethylsulfanyl)-nicotinonitrile (5b) and 6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-2-(methylthio)nicotinonitrile. Compound 5b was converted to (3-amino-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridin-2-yl)(phenyl)methanone (6b) by its boiling in ethanolic piperidine solution. 1H-NMR of 6b showed signals at δ 4.05 (s, 2H, NH2), and 7.14–7.78 (m, 11H, ArH’s) (Scheme 1).

In contrast, compound 2 was reacted with each of chloroacetonitrile and ethyl chloroacetate afforded 3-amino-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carbonitrile (6c) and ethyl 3-amino-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxylate (6d), in a good yield. Structure of 6c was confirmed by elemental analysis, spectral data and chemical transportation. Thus, compound 6c was reacted with each of formic acid or formamide to give the corresponding 7-(2-thienyl)-3-hydropyrimidino[4',5':4,5]thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-4-one (7) and 7-(2-thienyl)pyrimidine[4',5':4,5]thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-4-ylamine (8), respectively (Scheme 1). Structures 7 and 8 were established on the basis of spectral data and elemental analysis. Thus, IR spectrum of 7 revealed a band at 1666 (CO). IR spectrum of 8 revealed bands at 3320, 3151 (NH2). Meanwhile, 6c reacted with triethyl ortho-formate to give ethyl N-[6-(5-bromo-benzofuran-2-yl)-2-cyano-thieno[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl]-formimidoate (9). The latter compound was reacted with ammonia or formamide gave a product identical in all aspects (mp., mixed mp., and spectra) with compound 8.

Treatment of 2 with 2,4-pentanedione, ethyl 3-oxobutanoate, ethyl cyanoactate, malononitrile or benzoylacetonitrile in boiling acetic acid and ammonium acetate under refluxed gave 1-(6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-2-methylpyridin-3-yl)ethanone (10) and ethyl 6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-2-methylpyridine-3-carboxylate (11), ethyl 2-amino-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)pyridine-3-carboxylate (12), 2-amino-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)pyridine-3-carbonitrile (13) and 2-amino-6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-3-benzoylpyridine (14), respectively (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of pyridines 10–14.

Next, Compounds 11 was reacted with hydrazine hydrate afforded 2-methyl-6-(2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)pyridine-3-carbohydrazide (15). The structure of 15 was elucidated by elemental analyses, spectra and chemical transformations. Thus, compounds 15 was reacted with each of ethyl acetoacetate, acetylacetone and nitrous acid, gave 2-[6-(5-bromo-benzofuran-2-yl)-2-methyl-pyridine-3-carbonyl]-5-methyl-2,4-dihydropyrazol-3-one (16a), [6-(5-bromo-benzofuran-2-yl)-2-methyl-pyridin-3-yl]-(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-methanone (16b) and 6-(5-bromobenzofuran-2-yl)-2-methylnicotinoyl azide (20), respectively (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of pyridines 15–18, 20–22, quinazoline 22 and carbamates 23.

Structures 16a, 16b and 20 were confirmed by elemental analyses, spectral data and chemical transformations. Thus, treatment of 16a and 16b with benzenediazonium chloride in ethanolic sodium acetate gave 17 and 18, respectively. Structures 17 and 18 were confirmed by elemental analyses, spectral data and alternative synthetic route (reaction of the appropriate ethyl 3-oxo-2-(2-phenylhydrazono)butanoate (19a) [45] or 3-(2-phenylhydrazono)pentane-2,4-dione (19b) [46] with 15 in boiling acetic acid under refluxed gave identical product in aspects (mp., mixed mp. and spectra) with corresponding compounds 17 and 18). structure 20 was established by elemental analyses, spectral and chemical transformation. Thus, treatment of 20 with each of the appropriate aromatic amine (aniline, p-toluidine, p-anisidine, 3-amino-5-phenylpyrazole or anthranilic acid (or methyl anthranilate) in boiling dioxane and phenol in boiling benzene gave 1-[6-(5-bromo-benzofuran-2-yl)-2-methyl-pyridin-3-yl]-3-substituted urea 21a–d, 3-[6-(5-bromo-benzofuran-2-yl)-2-methylpyridin-3-yl]-1H-quinazoline-2,4-dione (22) and phenyl [6-(5-bromo-benzofuran-2-yl)-2-methyl-pyridin-3-yl]-carbamoate (23) (Scheme 3). Structures 21–23 were elucidated by elemental analyses and spectral data.

4. Conclusions
Compound 1 proved to be a useful precursor for synthesis of various pyridines and thieno[2,3-b]pyridines via its reactions with the appropriate cyanothioacetamide, 2-cyanoacetohydrazidem, pentane-2,4-dione, ethyl 3-oxobutanoate, ethyl cyanoacetate or benzoylacetonitrile. Moreover, compound 15 proved a useful precursor in the synthesis of various urea and carbomate derivatives. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral data and elemental analyses.
