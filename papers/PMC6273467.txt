==== Body
1. Introduction
The development of antimicrobial agents is an area of great activity due to the emergence of multidrug resistance in common pathogens and the appearance of new infections. Infectious diseases are considered the second-leading cause of death worldwide; consequently, tremendous efforts have been made to develop new antimicrobial agents that are active especially against the drug resistant strains.

The majority of antimicrobial agents are diverse five- and six-membered heterocyclic molecules that play a crucial role in the metabolism of all living cells [1]. Moreover, a great deal of interest has been directed toward condensed ring systems due to their various types of physiological activities and the success in utilizing them as privileged medicinal scaffolds. In particular, fused chromene and benzochromene molecules have become some of the best potential candidates for pharmacological purposes due to their antimicrobial [2,3], antileishmanial [4,5], anticancer [6,7], antiproliferative [8], antioxidant [9,10], hypertensive [11], antitumor [12,13,14,15] effects and activities, as well as for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease [16] and schizophrenia disorders [17].

Fused chromene ring systems also displayed blood platelet antiaggregating [18], antihistaminic [19], analgesic [20,21,22], hypolipidemic [23], DNA breaking and mutagenicity activities [24]. Furthermore, several reports have shown that 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine and 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine moieties are promising and attractive scaffolds for the development of potent antimicrobial agents [4,25,26,27,28]. In addition, 7H-benzo[h]-chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives exhibit anticancer activities [29,30,31,32,33].

In continuation of the previous works [15,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,34,35,36,37], it seemed interesting to synthesize some new 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]-pyrimidine and 14H-benzo-14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine derivatives and to appraise their antimicrobial activities. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) are discussed in this work to correlate between the substituent effects and the activities that aid in drug design.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Chemistry
The first series of the new chromene compounds was synthesized via multi component reactions of 4-methoxy-1-naphthol (1) with 4-halobenzaldehydes 2a–c and malononitrile (3) in ethanolic piperidine solution. The solution was refluxed for 1 h and gave the corresponding 2-amino-4-(4-halophenyl)-6-methoxy-4H-benzo[h]chromene-3-carbonitriles 4a–c. The desired compounds were also obtained from the same precursors using microwave irradiation for 2 min. at 140 °C. These results are depicted in Scheme 1.

Treatment of compounds 4a–c with triethyl orthoformate in acetic anhydride at reflux gave the 2-ethoxymethyleneamino-4-(4-halophenyl)-6-methoxy-4H-benzo[h]chromene-3-carbonitriles 5a–c. Subsequent hydrazinolysis of the latter in ethanol under stirring at room temperature gave 9-amino-7-(4-halophenyl)-5-methoxy-8-imino-7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d] pyrimidines 6a–c, as illustrated in Scheme 2.

The aminoimino compounds 6 proved to be useful intermediates for the synthesis of a variety of 2-substituted 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine derivatives. Thus, treatment of the aminoimino compounds 6a–c with either formic acid or methyl formate in benzene at reflux gave 14-(4-halophenyl)-12-methoxy-14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e]-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]-pyrimidines 7a–c, whilst acylation of compounds 6a–c with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride gave the pentacyclic 2-methyltriazolopyrimidine derivatives 7d–f. On the other hand, condensation of compounds 6a–c with diethyl oxalate and ethyl cyanoacetate afforded 2-ethoxycarbonyltriazolo-pyrimidines 7g–i and 2-cyanomethyltriazolopyrimidine derivatives 7j–l, respectively, as shown in Scheme 3.

Aroylation of compounds 6a–c with benzoyl chloride in refluxing dry benzene proceeded readily to give the 2-phenyltriazolopyrimidine derivatives 7m–o, Scheme 3. Condensation of the aminoimino compounds 6a–c with benzaldehyde in ethanolic piperidine solution under reflux gave the open chain product 9-benzylideneamino-7-(4-halophenyl)-5-methoxy-8-imino-7H-benzo[h]-chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidines 8a–c, Scheme 3. Compounds 7m–o were also prepared by cyclization of compounds 8a–c in 1,4-dioxane/piperdine solution under reflux [26] as confirmed by the m.p., mixed m.p., and their identical IR and MS spectra, Scheme 3.

Interaction of the aminoimino compounds 6a–c with ethyl chloroformate in dry benzene at reflux gave the corresponding 1:2 adducts, the 3-ethoxycarbonyl-14-(4-halophenyl)-12-methoxy-14H-benzo[h]-chromeno[3,2-e]-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-2-ones 12a–c instead of the 1:1 adducts, the triazolopyrimidin-2-one derivatives 11a–c. These results are depicted in Scheme 4. The formation of 12a–c is assumed to proceed via interaction of 6a–c with one mole of ethyl chloroformate and elimination of HCl to yield the intermediates 9a–c, which then cyclized to the non-isolable compounds 11a–c via elimination of EtOH. The intermediates 11a–c then reacted with another mole of ethyl chloroformate to eliminate HCl and give 12a–c. Alternatively, interaction of 6a–c with two moles of ethyl chloroformate could eliminate two HCl molecules and yield the intermediate bis-(ethoxycarbonyl) derivatives 10a–c, which then cyclized to 12a–c with elimination of an ethanol molecule (Scheme 4). The structures of 7, 8 and 12 were established on the basis of IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and MS data. The 7-position of compounds 8 and the 14-position of compounds 7 and 12 are chiral centers, and all the reactions were monitored using the TLC technique.

2.2. Antibacterial Evaluation
The target compounds 7a–o, 8a–c and 12a–c were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activities by the agar diffusion method using Mueller-Hinton agar medium for bacteria and Sabouraud’s agar medium for fungi [32,33]. The tested microorganisms were obtained from the Regional Center for Mycology & Biotechnology (RCMP), Al-Azhar University.

The assayed collection included four Gram-positive species of pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (RCMB 000106), Staphylococcus epidermidis (RCMB 000107), Bacillis subtilis (RCMB 000108), Bacillus pumilus (RCMB 000109), and two Gram-negative ones: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (RCMB 000102), Escherichia coli (RCMB 000103), using two standard antibiotics, ampicillin, and streptomycin (25 µg/mL) as reference drugs, and three fungi: Aspergillus fumigatus (RCMB 002003), Candida albicans (RCMB 005002) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RCMB 006002), using two standard antibiotics, mycostatine and clotrimazole (25 µg/mL) as reference drugs. The mean zone of inhibition in mm ± standard deviation beyond the well diameter (6 mm) was determined using a 25 µg/mL concentration of the tested compounds. The inhibitory effects of the synthetic compounds against these organisms are given in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 and Table 1.

2.3. SAR Studies
The structure activity relationship (SAR) studies of compounds 7a–o, 8a–c and 12a–c revealed that compounds 8a–c and 7j with inhibitory effects of 21.8 ± 0.14, 24.6 ± 0.21, 26.6 ± 0.13 and 27.3 ± 0.47 µg/mL were 1.3, 1.1, 1.0, 1.0 times more active than the standard antibiotic ampicillin (27.4 ± 0.15 µg/mL), while compounds 8a, b were 1.2 and 1.0 times more active than the standard antibiotic streptomycin (25.1 ± 0.18 µg/mL) against S. aureus, respectively, and other compounds showed almost equipotent activities or were inactive, implying that the 7H-benzo[h]chromeno-[2,3-d]-pyrimidine nucleus was more active than the 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo-[1,5-c]-pyrimidine one and grafting a lipophilic hydrophobic group (=NH-8, –N=CHPh-9) or halogen (F > Cl > Br) on the 4-position of the phenyl group at the 7-position of the 7H-benzo[h]chromeno-[2,3-d]pyrimidine moiety is more beneficial than a CH2CN group at the 2-position of a 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine. Compounds 7a,i,h,g,m,b,n,d,o, 8a, 7c,e,f,j, 8b, 7k,l, 8c were found to be the most potent against S. epidermidis, with inhibitory effects ranging from 11.9 to 28.5 µg/mL compared to standard antibiotics ampicillin and streptomycin (28.6 ± 0.5 and 29.1 ± 0.3 µg/mL), suggesting that the 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine nucleus was more effective than the 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus. Moreover, the non-substituted triazolo ring at the 2-postion is better than a hydrophobic moiety like a CO2Et, Ph, Me and CH2CN group. In addition, compounds 7k,j,l and 8a–c) showed good activity against B. subtilis with inhibitory effects ranging 12.2–25.1 µg/mL as compared to the standard antibiotics ampicillin and streptomycin (29.4 ± 0.7 and 30.1 ± 0.9 µg/mL), while compounds 7k,j,l and 8c,b,a with inhibitory effects ranging 12.2–24.0 µg/mL, exhibited good activity against B. pumilus as compared to the standard antibiotics ampicillin and streptomycin (29.9 ± 0.3 and 30.8 ± 0.4 µg/mL). These results implied that 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine nucleus with hydrophobic group CH2CN group at 2-position was more beneficial than 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus with a lipophilic hydrophobic groups (=NH-8, –N=CHPh-9). Furthermore, compounds 8a–c exhibited good activities against P. aeruginosa, with inhibitory effects ranging from 19.3–23.3 µg/mL, as compared to the standard antibiotics ampicillin and streptomycin (26.3 ± 0.3 and 24.3 ± 0.8 µg/mL), while compounds 8c,b,a and 7k,j,l showed high activities against E. coli, with inhibitory effects ranging from 20.7–27.8 µg/mL as compared to the standard antibiotics ampicillin and streptomycin (28.5 ± 0.1 and 25.6 ± 0.4 µg/mL), suggesting that a 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus with a lipophilic hydrophobic group (=NH-8, –N=CHPh-9) was more effective than a 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine nucleus with a hydrophobic CH2CN group at the 2-position. Finally, compounds 7l,k,j, 7j–l and 8c,b,a)with inhibitory effects ranging from 12.1–12.3, 19.3–21.2, 22.1–23.8 and 21.7–22.9 µg/mL, respectively, showed high activity against A. fumigatus and C. albicans as compared to the standard antibiotics mycostatine (29.5 ± 0.1 and 27.1 ± 0.1 µg/mL) and clotrimazole (26.1 ± 0.1 and 23.1 ± 0.3 µg/mL), respectively, implying that the 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine nucleus with a hydrophobic CH2CN group at the 2-position was more active than a 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus with a lipophilic hydrophobic group (=NH-8, –N=CHPh-9), while compounds 8a–c and 7l,k,j with inhibitory effects between 16.8–19.5 and 18.2–23.3 µg/mL, respectively, are more effective against S. cerevisiae as compared to the standard antibiotic mycostatine (24.1 ± 0.3 µg/mL) and compounds 8a,b and 7l (16.8–18.2 µg/mL) are more active than the standard antibiotic clotrimazole (18.3 ± 0.1 µg/mL). The rest of the compounds showed almost equipotent and moderate activities or were inactive.

3. Experimental Section
3.1. General Information
Commercial-grade solvents and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and used without further purification. Melting points were measured with a Stuart Scientific (Stone, Staffordshire, UK) apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were determined as KBr pellets on a Jasco FT/IR 460 plus spectrophotometer (Jasco, Tokoyo, Japan). 1H-NMR (500 MHz) and 13C-NMR (125 MHz) spectra were recorded using a Bruker AV 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per million (ppm). The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the compounds are provided in the Supplementary Material. The MS were measured using a Shimadzu GC/MS-QP5050A spectrometer (Shimadzu, Tokoyo, Japan). Elemental analyses were carried out at the Regional Centre for Mycology & Biotechnology (RCMP, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt) and the results were within ±0.3% of calculated values. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel precoated F254 plates (Merck, Billerica, MA, USA) was used to check the purity of the final compounds and intermediates.

3.3. Antimicrobial Assay
All the newly synthesized compounds 7a–o, 8a–c and 12a–c were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity at 25 µg/mL to determine the zone of inhibition against four Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (RCMB 000106), Staphylococcus epidermidis (RCMB 000107), Bacillis subtilis (RCMB 000108), Bacillus pumilus (RCMB 000109), and two Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (RCMB 000102), Escherichia coli (RCMB 000103) using two standard antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin) as reference drugs, and three fungi: Aspergillus fumigatus (RCMB 002003), Candida albicans (RCMB 005002) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RCMB 006002) using two standard antibiotics (mycostatine, clotrimazole) as reference drugs. The activities of these compounds were tested by agar diffusion method using Mueller-Hinton agar medium for bacteria and Sabouraud’s agar medium for fungi [31,32]. The tested compounds were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to give a solution of 1 mg·mL−1. The inhibition zones (diameter of the hole) were measured in millimeters (6 mm) at the end of an incubation period of 48 h at 28 °C; N,N-dimethylformamide showed no inhibition zone.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, several 14-(4-halophenyl)-12-methoxy-14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine and 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized in good yields, starting from 4H-benzo[h]chromene derivatives. The structures of compounds 7, 8 and 12 were established on the basis of IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and MS data. A pharmacological study has been performed in order to evaluate the effects of substituents on the antibacterial and antifungal activities. Compounds 12a–c did not show any antimicrobial activity against any of the tested bacteria and fungi, while compounds 7a,i,h,g,m,b,n,d,o,c,e,f showed high to good activities only against Staphylococcus epidermidis as compared to ampicillin and streptomycin. In contrast, compounds 7j–l and 8a–b showed high activity against all tested microorganisms. The rest of compounds showed almost equipotent and moderate activities or were inactive. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) study revealed that the antimicrobial activity of 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]-pyrimidine nucleus was more affected by the lipophilicity of the non-substituent or 2-substituents than by lipophilic hydrophobic groups (=NH-8, –N=CHPh-9) on the 7H-benzo[h]-chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus and the 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]-pyrimidine nucleus was more beneficial than the 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus for the antimicrobial activity.
