Patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) usually display cognitive deficits with
aging. However, the correlation between BD and dementia syndromes is
inconclusive, despite the similarity with behavioral variant frontotemporal
dementia. We report a 78-year-old female patient who had bipolar type 1 disorder
since adolescence. Her symptoms ranged from apathy to psychotic mania. She had
had three hospitalizations, and since her last stay 10 years ago, her symptoms
had remained stable. However, in the past 2 years, she displayed different
symptoms, such as irritability manifested as verbal and physical aggression,
cognitive impairment, repetitive pattern of behavior, perambulation, persecutory
delusions, disorientation, and hyporexia. Treatment with anticholinesterases or
mood stabilizers promoted no improvement. She scored 17/30 points on the
Mini-Mental State Examination. Neuropsychological assessment suggested deficits
in executive function, attention, and memory. Neuroimaging tests revealed
frontotemporal degeneration and hypoperfusion. Diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches for this type of patient represent a significant challenge for
clinicians.

RESUMO
Pacientes com Transtorno Bipolar (TB) costumam apresentardéficits cognitivosao
envelhecer. No entanto, a correlação com síndromes demenciais é inconclusiva,
apesar da similaridade com a variante comportamental da demência frontotemporal
(bvFTD). Nósrelatamos uma paciente de 78 anos de idade com TB tipo 1 desde a
adolescência. Seus sintomas variavam de apatia a mania psicótica. A paciente
passou por 3 internações, sendo a última há 10 anos, seguida de estabilização
clínica. No entanto, nos últimos 2 anos, ela apresentou sintomas diferentes,
como irritabilidade expressada por agressões verbal e física, comprometimento
cognitivo, padrão repetitivo de comportamento, perambulação, delírios
persecutórios, desorientação e hiporexia. O tratamento com anticolinesterásicos
ou estabilizadores de humor não revelou melhora. Apresentou 17/30 pontos no
miniexame do estado mental, a avaliação neuropsicológica sugeriu déficit de
função executiva, atenção e memória. Os exames de neuroimagem demonstraram
atrofia e hipoperfusão fronto-temporal. Abordagens diagnósticas e terapêuticas
para este tipo de paciente representam um desafio significativo para os
clínicos.

==== Body
Cognitive impairment has a close relationship with mental disorders. In this scenario,
Bipolar Disorder (BD) presents the highest risk for the development of dementia
syndromes when compared to other clinical diseases.1 Cognitive impairments in the course
of BD affect mainly memory, attention, language, and executive functions, even during
the euthymia stage.2 Despite the similarities with behavioral variant frontotemporal
dementia (bvFTD), attempts to correlate BD with dementia syndromes have proved
inconclusive.3 Although some studies reveal stability of cognitive impairment,4 others
show cognitive impairment and neuroprogression to dementia.5

It is worth mentioning that doubts concerning the differentiation between the cognitive
impairment typi cal in older patients with bipolar I disorder (BDI) and that seen in
other dementias pose diagnostic challenges and can lead to treatment failures. For
instance, the use of anticholinesterasics in patients with ith BDI may not be
appropriate, with some cases of manic-switch reported.6 In this context, the present study aims to describe the observations of a
patient who clearly displayed neuropsychiatric symptoms and the possibility of
neuroprogression in BDI. Based on this report, we intend to draw neuropsychological
inferences and demonstrate the need for a better understanding on evolution of bipolar
patients. 

CASE REPORT
A 78-year-old woman was admitted to a university clinic with complaints of cognitive
impairment associated with functional deterioration and worsening behavior. At
admission, she was totally dependent according to the Lawton Instrumental Activities
of Daily Living Scale (IADLs) (0/9 points)7
and semi-dependent according to the Katz index of independence in Activities of
Daily Living (Katz ADL) (4/6),8 requiring
assistance for bathing and tooth brushing. The patient had received 4 years of
education and was diagnosed with BDI at age 16. She had been given galantamine 16
mg/day because of suspected Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the treatment, the
patient displayed worsening hyporexia, psychomotor agitation, and no clinically
significant improvements in cognition, behavior, or functioning. 

She had had three hospitalizations and the symptoms ranged from apathy to euphoria
with psychotic symptoms. The last hospitalization occurred 10 years before referral.
After hospital discharge, the patient remained in euthymia for 6 years and was
treated with oxcarbazepine at a dose of 600 mg/day, bromazepam 3 mg/day, and
risperidone 1 mg/day. However, the patient reported progressive neuropsychiatric
alterations in the last 2 years with different characteristics, such as impulsivity
and irritability manifesting as verbal and physical aggression, short-term memory
loss, repetitive pattern of behavior, perambulation, persecutory delusions,
disorientation, and hyporexia. She also presented with occupational impairment and
loss of functionality, forcing her to take leave from her work activities.

Neuropsychological evaluation revealed executive function, language, memory and
attention deficits, with considerable frontal lobe involvement (Table 1). In her recent neuroimaging studies,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed brain atrophy with
frontotemporal predominance and incipient ischemic microangiopathy (Figure 1). Single-photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) revealed moderate-to-severe bilateral frontotemporal
hypoperfusion/activation (Figure 2) The patient
had a long history of medication use, which included lithium carbonate, sodium
valproate, olanzapine, sertraline, escitalopram, and trazodone. She presented with
systemic arterial hypertension and hypothyroidism. She reported no history of
alcoholism, smoking, or illicit drug use. Two sisters had psychiatric disorders and
the mother had an unspecified dementia syndrome.

Clinical examination revealed signs of parkinsonism, aggressiveness, apathy, speech
impairment, depressed mood, and facial hypomimia. On cognitive assessment, the
patient scored 17/30 points in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 5 points
in the verbal fluency test using the animal category. Laboratory and serology tests
for secondary dementia screening were all within the normal range. In addition, the
diagnosis of delirium was excluded based on complementary exams and
also considering that the disease is characterized by acute symptoms with
fluctuating clinical course.

In this context, we hypothesized the presence of a non-Alzheimer’s dementia syndrome
with possible bvFTD or cognitive impairment as a result of neuroprogression in BDI.
We opted to suspend galantamine, withdraw risperidone and continue with quetiapine.
Although the patient progressed with partial improvement of psychomotor agitation,
she showed gradual worsening of apathy and aphasia, with progressive
cognitive/functional losses. The patient died 4 years later from pulmonary
infectious complications.

DISCUSSION
Although our patient revealed a profile and clinical evolution similar to those
described in neuroprogression in BD,9 the
association with other dementia syndromes, especially bvFTD, could not be excluded.
A systematic review describing cognitive impairment in bipolar patients has been
published, especially addressing executive function disorder.10 It suggested that bipolar patients have a reduced cerebral
reserve capacity, demonstrated by worsening cognitive impairment throughout the
lifespan.10 The type of cognitive
impairment observed in BD patients may have a clinical, neuropsychological and
imaging presentation that resembles bvFTD.11
Clinical observations report neuroprogression to dementia in patients with BD over a
30-year period.12 Some recent studies have
suggested an etiopathogenic association between BD and a specific dementia syndrome,
similar to bvFTD.12


In the present case, we observed a change in our patient’s patterns of behavior when
compared to the symptoms previously presented, but occurring at a later age. These
changes failed to respond adequately to the use of mood stabilizers or
anticholinesterasics, evolving with behavioral worsening, and progressive cognitive
and functional impairment. Based on the current diagnostic criteria for bvFTD,13 and on evidence showing that age has little
influence on manic psychopathology,14 it is
possible to affirm that our patient had probable bvFTD, although we understand that
BD could cause underlying cognitive impairments. Even though bipolar patients have
an increased risk of cognitive impairment associated with age-related
pathologies,1 atypical Alzheimer’s
dementia was not considered as a differential diagnosis based on initial behavioral
worsening, therapeutic response and neuroimaging findings. 

The literature shows impact on the psychosocial functioning of these patients mainly
due to mood state and cognition, which may remain even after the acute phases of the
disease.2


Factors linked to BD that may influence cognition include number of mood or psychotic
episodes, hospitalizations, age at onset, duration of illness, polypharmacy, and
presence of clinical comorbidity.10 Our
patient had a long history of BDI, with past psychiatric hospitalizations, psychotic
symptoms, and use of various psychotropic medications.

Elderly patients with BD had worse performance on psychomotor speed, attention,
memory, verbal fluency, and executive functions, as well as worse psychosocial
functioning, independent of current mood state or iatrogenic effects of psychotropic
drugs.15
,
16 Neuropsychological assessment suggested an
impairment pattern that could be present both in patients with BDI and dementia
syndromes.2 Thus, establishing a
differential diagnosis of bvFTD in a bipolar patient becomes a challenge, and we
could not rule out a causal association between the two entities.

There is weak evidence that cortical atrophy and white-matter vascular lesions are
more common in older people with BD than in normal controls, where it remains
uncertain whether this finding is attributed to the psychopathological process or to
secondary factors.17 We performed
neuroimaging analysis to evaluate the differential diagnosis considering that the
patient exhibited behavioral and cognitive changes suggestive of bvFTD. In our
patient, functional and structural neuroimaging studies revealed signs of
hypofunction and atrophy of the frontotemporal region, as demonstrated in scientific
literature establishing a possible association between frontal and temporal circuit
dysfunction and certain cognitive impairments.18 A follow-up study established an association between BDI severity,
memory loss, and reduction of gray matter volume in the medial temporal cortex.19 This information may be strongly associated
with frontal and social deficits exhibited by individuals with BD. The vascular
hypothesis for the impairments found in our patient would be less likely given the
minor subcortical vascular damage observed, relatively common in patients from this
age group.20


Although signs of memory deficits have been reported as commencing together with the
patient’s functional decline, disagreement between the onset of objective memory
impairments and the observation of the symptoms by third-parties is not uncommon,
usually because these individuals are unaware of dementia syndromes. A possible
hypothesis could be the mistaken notion that memory loss and functional decline are
an inevitable part of aging or a refusal to accept a decline in the functional
abilities of relatives with dementia.21
Although memory is only affected in more advanced stages of FTD, the initial picture
of apathy, irritability, and impairment in self-control, self-care, and body hygiene
revealed by our patient fits into the clinical manifestations typical of FTD
patients. In the case of FTD, behavioral changes tend to be more prominent in the
early stages, with preservation of visuospatial functions, spatial orientation, and
memory, contrasting with milder changes in behavior, less self-neglect and emotional
blunting, and a longer course related to a possible distinct dementia in BD.13

22


The concept of clinical heterogeneity is present in both pathologies, representing a
difficulty in establishing precise diagnostic criteria, particularly in bvFTD, whose
criteria have been the subject of discussion and proposals for revision due to the
expansion of the functional, genetic, and biochemical knowledge.23 Hypotheses related to neuroprogression and
neurodegeneration may justify the cognitive impairments presented by patients with
BD, probably due to a combination of early genetic factors, environmental risk
factors, medical comorbidities, iatrogenic effects, and aging itself.23
,
24 Glial cell density reductions demonstrated
in postmortem studies in patients with BD reveal that their brains may be more
vulnerable to toxic, metabolic, and ischemic insults during adult life.25


In view of the information presented here, it is pertinent to infer the need for
further prospective studies, especially cohort studies associated with postmortem
pathological analysis involving patients with BDI, to better clarify the biological
plausibility of cognitive impairment, which might be a multifactorial entity with
different evolution patterns from those observed in bvFTD. Another important aspect
is the establishment of new protocols for neuropsychological assessment and of
nosological classification criteria with the use of neuroimaging for diagnostic
elucidation.
