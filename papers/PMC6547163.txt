In the original article, there was an error. We did not add an acknowledgement section, which is required in order to acknowledge a financial contribution we recently received.

A correction has therefore been made to the original article and the section ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS has been added:

“Sergio Eduardo de Carvalho Machado, was supported by a grant from the Carlos Chagas Foundation for the Research Support in the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), Young Scientists from the State of Rio de Janeiro, E -26/203.295/2017.”

The authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way. The original article has been updated.
