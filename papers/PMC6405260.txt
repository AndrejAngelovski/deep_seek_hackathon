plays a role in a multitude of cellular processes and abnormal S100B is
associated with various neurological diseases and cancers. S100B recognizes and
binds effector proteins in a calcium-dependent manner. S100B has been shown to
interact with the actin capping protein CapZ, protein kinase C, Hdm2 and 4, RAGE
receptor, and p53, among others. These protein partners interact with
a common area on the S100B protein surface, validating the method of using the
consensus sequence for S100B target search. In addition, each S100B target
protein distinguishes itself by additional contacts with S100B. This perspective
suggests that the combination of sequence homology search and structural
analysis promises to identify newer S100B-binding partners beyond the use of the
consensus sequence alone as the given example in the XPB subunit of the TFIIH
general transcription factor. XPB is a helicase required for both transcription
and DNA repair. Inherited xpb mutations are associated with human disease
Xeroderma Pigmentasum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy. S100B protein
is likely associated with much more biological pathways and processes. We
believe that S100B will attract more and more attentions in the scientific
community and S100B related studies will have important implications in human
health and medicine.

Introduction
The S100B protein belongs to the S100 family of Ca2+-binding
signaling proteins which share dual conserved calcium-binding EF- hand motifs. S100
proteins exist exclusively in vertebrates, with 24 members observed in humans [1]. S100B is expressed in astrocytes, Schwann
cells, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, among others [2].

Acting as both an intracellular regulator and as a secreted signaling
molecule, the S100B protein plays a role in a myriad of cellular processes,
including cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and differentiation [3–7].

Consequently, aberrant expression levels of S100B have been implicated in a
variety of neurological diseases, cancer, and inflammatory disorders [8–14]. As
S100B has no intrinsic enzymatic activity, its intra and extracellular functions are
achieved exclusively by physical interactions to its target molecules in a
calcium-dependent manner.

Currently S100B has been reported to interact with a variety of protein
targets including the p53 tumor suppressor, CapZ, the RAGE receptor, NDR kinase,
neurotensin, cathepsin L inhibitor, Hdm2, Hdm4, protein kinase Cα, ROS-GC1,
microtubule-associated tau proteins, melittin, amyloid-β, interleukin-11, the
serotonin 5-HT7 receptor, the dopamine D2 receptor and RSK1 [15–29].
This short perspective focuses on the structural basis of S100B-protein
interactions.

Literature Review
Structural comparison of S100B-peptide complexes
S100B exists primarily as a homodimer of two approximately 11 kDa
monomers (Figure 1A), though stable and
active tetrameric, hexameric, and octameric forms have been reported [30]. The S100B monomer consists of four
α-helices with a β-strand between both helices 1 and 2, and 3 and
4, composing two helix-loop-helix EF-hand motifs connected by a linker region.
The C-terminal canonical motif is made up of 12 amino acids involved in
Ca2+-ion binding, while the N- terminal EF-hand (also termed the
“S100-hand” ) contains 14 amino acids, therefore being considered
by some as a pseudo-EF-hand because of the extra two amino acids [31,32]. Calcium binding in the N-terminal site I induces limited
changes to the structure as a whole (RMSD = 1.472 over 33 atoms), while binding
at the C-terminal site II induces a conformational change in helix 3 of up to
90°, leading to the exposure of the binding site for target proteins to
access (Figure 1B) [33,34].

S100B interacting protein targets are largely identified by a
sequence-based approach using the consensus S100B-interacting sequence
([K/R]-[L/I]-x-W-x-x-I-L). Pioneered by Ivanenkov et al. [18], the sequence was initially proposed based on
phage display library screening for bacteriophage exhibiting
Ca2+− dependent interaction with S100B. Employing the
consensus sequence in homology searches revealed the actin capping protein
(CapZ) as a potential target [18].
Specifically, the peptide TRTKIDWNKILS, referred to as TRTK-12, was chosen due
to its significant homology to the consensus sequence. Further investigation
revealed Ca2+− dependent interaction between S100B and TRTK-12
or CapZ, leading to the TRTK-12 inhibition of the S100B-CapZ interaction [18]. Subsequent expansion of the
S100B-interaction consensus sequence by Wilder et al. to
[K/R]-[L/I]-[P/S/N/D]-[W/L/I]-[S/D/L]- x -[L/I]-[L/F] allowed for additional
protein targets to be identified and analyzed for S100B interaction. S100B has
so far been shown to interact with short peptides derived from protein sequences
of the p53 tumor suppressor, CapZ, the RAGE receptor, NDR kinase,
neurotensin, cathepsin L inhibitor, Hdm2, Hdm4, protein kinase Cα,
ROS-GC1 [21,22], microtubule-associated tau proteins, melittin,
amyloid-β, interleukin-11, the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor, the dopamine D2
receptor and RSK1 [15,19–29].

The NMR structure solution of the bovine S100B apo-form yielded the first
structural view of a S100B protein [35].
Since then, the past 20 years has seen a wealth of information on S100B
conformational variability induced by pH [36], temperature [37], and
metal ion- dependence [30,33,38–41]. S100B
primarily interacts with its target proteins in the Ca2+−bound
state [42]. Other targets, such as the
giant phosphoprotein AHNAK, are recognized in a Zn2+−
dependent manner [43]. Several complexes
of Ca2+− bound S100B with short peptides derived from its
known targets have been evaluated by NMR and X-ray crystallography, including
p53, the NDR kinase, the RAGE receptor, RSK1 and CapZ [19,29,43–48].

The S100B interaction with p53 was first proposed by Baudier
et al. based on the similarity of the p53 PKC-phosphorylation site to
that of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein
[49]. MARCKS phosphorylation is
inhibited by EF-hand proteins, including S100B, though the MARCKS PKC-site is
not in a good agreement with the S100B consensus sequence [50]. In addition, another region of p53
capable of interacting with S100B was identified in the p53
oligomerization domain [17]. S100B thus
inhibits p53 oligomerization [4], as well as phosphorylation by PKC at the p53 C- terminus
[49]. It was further shown that a
peptide derived from the p53 carboxy-terminal regulatory domain (CTD)
could be phosphorylated by PKC, and this activity could be inhibited by S100B
[16]. Such inhibition events
consequently reduce the p53 transcriptional activity, preventing its
stimulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [4].

To counteract the deleterious effects of S100B on p53
activity, small molecule screening studies have revealed several inhibitors of
the S100B-p53 interaction including pentamidine (Pnt) in the form of
pentamidine isethionate, an antiprotozoal drug currently approved for treatment
of Pneumocystis cariini pneumonia [51,52]. Pnt has been shown to
disrupt the S100B-p53 complex, resulting in increased cell apoptosis,
p53 expression, and decreased cell migration [53]. Phase II clinical trial results revealed a
myriad of adverse effects during melanoma treatment with Pnt (www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier
NCT00729807). Structure solution of the S100B-Pnt complex showed two Pnt
molecules bound per monomer, occupying two sites adjacent to the p53
binding surface [40]. Further screening
studies found several potential inhibitors binding in the hydrophobic cleft of
the p53 binding site [52,54]. These findings together show three
binding sites for drug inhibitors of the S100B-p53 interaction. Currently, the
goal is to design inhibitors that span all three sites, likely providing higher
affinity and specificity for S100B binding. The Weber group has performed
several studies investigating small molecules binding in the three different
sites and identifying the so called “FF-gate” composed of Phe87
and Phe88, normally occupying a channel between sites 1 and 2, occluded by a Pnt
analog [52,55–57].
They also identified molecules exclusive to site 3 [56]. With the extensive structural and biochemical
data available, a potent inhibitor of the S100B-p53 complex formation seems
right around the corner.

Discussion
Structural analysis of the complex between S100B and a p53-CTD
peptide (amino acids 367–388) revealed an induced folding of the peptide,
normally unstructured, into an α-helical structure (Figure 2A) [44].
This same induced helical fold is observed in other targets of S100B: RSK1, RAGE,
and the NDR kinase (Figure 2B). While all three
of these peptides adopt a similar fold when bound to S100B and share a common
binding area on the surface of S100B, each target protein does distinguish itself by
additional contacts with S100B. In the complex of S100B with an NDR kinase peptide,
several hydrophobic contacts are made between NDR side chains and the hydrophobic
core of the S100B binding site [19]. In
addition, electrostatic interactions are observed between helical side chains from
NDR with the linker region of S100B [19]. In
the S100B-RSK1 study, Gogl et al. used several peptides to generate co-crystals of
the protein-peptide complex, resulting in several crystal structures showing altered
binding of peptide(s) to S100B dimers [29].
These interactions have been confirmed by SAXS analysis and NMR NOE assignments
[29]. Two of the four tested peptides
adopted a helical fold extending through the binding pocket of S100B, with one
nearly extending into the unbound S100B subunit of the dimer (Figure 2B). Both structures, however, seem to bypass
completely the canonical hydrophobic binding pocket of Ca2+-bound S100B,
with primarily hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with the S100B linker
and surface residues facilitating the interaction. Binding of the RAGE peptide, on
the other hand, relies almost exclusively on the S100B hydrophobic binding pocket
[45]. With minimal hydrogen bonding and
no clear salt bridge formation between the peptide and S100B, the interaction is
maintained via burying three hydrophobic residues in the S100B site after the
induced helical fold of the peptide (Figure
2B). Indeed, the diversity observed in the interaction surfaces among S100B
and its target proteins reveals an extremely large binding surface on S100B allowing
for binding a diverse selection of peptide sequences (Figure 2B) [15].

To quantitatively compare the interaction energies of the S100B- peptide
complexes, we analyzed the structure models using the Proteins, Interfaces,
Structures and Assemblies (PISA) server [58];
the results are summarized in Table 1. The
results of the PISA analysis compared to the dissociation constants reported for the
different complexes reveal a strong correlation between the ΔG of solvation
and the Kd values. One exception was the TRTK-12 peptide, though this is likely due
to the exceptionally hydrophobic nature of its interface as evidenced by its low
ΔG P-value. Indeed, the strongest interaction (Kd = 0.04 ± 0.02
μΜ) coincides with the largest ΔG (−13.4 kcal/mol) in
the RSK1-A peptide while the weakest interaction (Kd = 23.5 ± 6.6)
has the smallest ΔG (−5.0 kcal/mol) in the p53
peptide-S100B complex.

This apparent correlation between the in silico and
in vitro quantitative data suggests that known structures can
be used as the guidance to identify new S100B targets of high-affinity. As the pool
of available S100B-target peptide complex structures grows, it has become clear that
the S100B-interaction consensus sequence is largely limiting in that the specific
residues involved in interaction with S100B vary greatly between peptide sequences
[15]. To reflect this in the search for
new S100B targets, specific peptide sequences should be used together with
structural homology of the interacting residues. Utilizing this new approach, we
identified a new potential target of S100B in the XPB helicase subunit of the
general transcription factor TFIIH.

XPB-S100B proposed interaction
The Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group B (XPB) helicase is the
largest subunit of the general transcription factor II (TFIIH) complex. XPB
plays vital roles in both transcription and nucleotide excision repair [59]. Being an ATP-dependent
3̛-5̛ helicase, the XPB helicase facilitates the opening of the
DNA helix during NER to allow for removal of bulky DNA adducts generated as a
consequence of UV exposure or chemical therapies for anticancer treatment [59,60]. In addition, the XPB ATPase activity is critical for initiation
and promoter melting during transcription [61–63].

Several structural studies have provided a framework for how XPB
functions as a molecular wrench to melt dsDNA both alone [64,65] and in
the context of TFIIH [66–68]. In addition, a high-resolution crystal
structure by Hilario et al. provided a model for how the proposed XPB-XPF
complex forms to facilitate the 5̛ -incision during NER [69]. Phosphorylation of Ser751 in the C-terminus of
XPB acts as a key regulatory site during NER via modulating XPF activity [70]. Furthermore, we notice that the XPB
extreme C-terminus shares sequence homology with key residues of the
p53-CTD, and so we propose that XPB should interact with S100B in
a similar fashion to that of the p53-S100B complex [44]. Interestingly, such interaction was postulated
previously by Lin et al. based on the XPB-p53 C-terminal interaction
[4]. XPB could block the inhibitory
S100B targeting of p53 in a competitive manner. A similar mode of
regulation was proposed for the S100B-RSK1 complex by Gogl et al. Based on their
structural modeling, S100B binding could block ERK2 binding to RSK1, and thus
inhibit the phosphorylation of the RSK1 activation loop [29]. This inhibition of RSK1 phosphorylation by
S100B, coupled with its inhibition of the RSK1 C-terminal kinase domain,
explains how S100B blocks the MAPK signal cascade via RSK1 in malignant melanoma
[29]. In a similar fasion, S100B-XPB
interactions could have a regulatory role in transcription and/or DNA repair.
Specifically, S100B binding to the XPB C-terminal tail could interfere with the
phosphorylation of Ser751 of XPB and/or dephosphorylation, resulting in
inhibition or stimulation, respectively, of the XPF endonuclease during DNA
repair [70]. Alternatively, S100B could
physically block the interaction of XPB with the XPF endonuclease complex
directly.

Although the amino acid sequences of the XPB and p53 extreme
C-termini share low sequence homology (~23% using BLAST), most of the
conserved residues in p53 form direct contacts with S100B in the
S100B-p53 peptide complex (PDB entry 1DT7) (Figures 3A and 3B). Specifically, Arg379, His380,
Lys382, Met384, Phe385, and Lys386 of the p53 peptide show direct
contacts with residues of S100B, implying similar interactions in the S100B-XPB
complex involving the identical or similar residues Lys771, His772, His774,
Leu776, Phe777, and Lys778 of XPB, respectively. Our preliminary results do
suggest a stable complex formed between S100B and the XPB C-terminal half
consisting of residues 494–782 (Figure
4). During gel filtration chromatography, the peaks of individual XPB
and S100B are both shifted to a higher apparent molecular weight when the two
proteins are mixed together (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, we noticed that a degraded XPB protein (XPBc-Δ) lack of the
last 52 residues did not shift, in agreement with our prediction that XPB
interacts with S100B via its C-terminal residues. These observations confirm
that the sequence conservation between the C-termini of XPB and p53
seems sufficient for the interactions with S100B. However, one important
discrepancy lies with Leu383 of p53, as the corresponding residue of
XPB is Pro775. The presence of a proline residue in the XPB sequence would
prevent formation of an alpha-helical structure in this region of XPB due to the
geometric restrictions of the proline side-chain. This would suggest some
changes in the S100B-XPB interface compared to that of S100B-p53 complex. It
will be very interesting to further investigate the structural features of the
S100B-XPB interface and the biological impact of such an interaction (Figure 4B).

Conclusion and Future Research
In this review, we analyzed the structural basis of the S100B-peptide
interactions on available data and literature information. Besides the common
binding area shared by all S100B interacting proteins, the additional contacts
provided by each target warrant the limitation of sequence only search in
identifying new S100B target proteins. We believe that the combinatorial
sequence/structure-homology approach for S100B target identification will expand new
S100B targets beyond the use of sequence-based searches alone. The identification of
the XPB protein as a new S100B target likely reveals a new means of regulating
transcription and/or DNA repair through S100B. With the diversity of targets already
identified, the processes involving S100B, and other S100 proteins, are likely far
more extensive than what we currently know and could have important implications in
human health and medicine.
