Background
Infertile females experience some types of distress such as social stress, depression, and sexual dys-
function that may be exacerbated by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The current study aimed at comparing
psychological profile of infertile females with PCOS with that of women without PCOS with respect to four domains:
infertility stress, depression, sexual dysfunction, and alexithymia.

Materials and Methods
The current case-control study was conducted on 240 infertile females (120 with
PCOS and 120 without PCOS) in Fatemeh Azahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center (Babol,
Iran) from 2016 to 2017. The following questionnaires were used to collect data: the fertility problem inven-
tory (FPI), the female sexual function index (FSFI), the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Toronto
alexithymia scale (TAS-20).

Results
Females with PCOS had higher FPI total scores than the ones without PCOS (120.68 ± 29.42 vs. 112.83 ±
30.94). Of the subscales of infertility stress, the mean scores of social stress and rejection of a future life without a
child were higher in females with PCOS than the ones without PCOS (P<0.05). Also, the mean total scores of alexithy-
mia symptoms (TAS-20) in females with PCOS were significantly higher than those of the ones without PCOS (59.83
± 11.36 vs. 55.69 ± 11.52). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean scores of
depression symptoms and sexual function.

Conclusion
Infertile females with PCOS experienced higher levels of infertility stress and inability to distinguish
and describe their feelings compared with the ones without PCOS. It is suggested that infertility care providers should
provide more psychosocial support for infertile females with PCOS.

==== Body
Introduction
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the 
most common etiological factors of infertility which is 
identified in up to 20% of infertile females (1). Studies 
emphasized that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders 
is high in patients with PCOS. A longitudinal 
study reported a prevalence of 40% for depression in 
patients with PCOS (2). A cohort study reported that 
PCOS can increase the risk of schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder, personality disorders, and tics (3). Other psychiatric 
disorders such as anxiety, eating disorders, and 
sexual dysfunction disorders are common in patients 
with PCOS (4). In addition, females with PCOS reported 
lower body image satisfaction compared to the ones 
without PCOS (5). Clinical manifestations of PCOS including 
menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and acne may 
exacerbate distress in the affected females (6). 

Many females experience infertility as a feeling of 
distress and stigma (7). Infertile females experience 
some types of distress such as social stress, depression, 
sexual dysfunction, and marital dissatisfaction (8-10) 
that may be exacerbated by PCOS. Kitzinger and Willmott 
(11) introduced PCOS as a stigma, “the thief of 
womanhood”. Infertile females with PCOS and infertility 
problems may experience being less feminine, due 
to excessive hair growth and absence of or irregular 
menstrual periods (12). Additionally, infertility management 
processes such as assisted reproductive techniques 
are more stressful in females with PCOS than 
the ones without it (13). 

Alexithymia is a personality construct with inability 
in normal affect regulation that is comprised of five 
characteristics including difficulty to identify and distinguish 
emotions from bodily sensations, difficulty to 
describe and verbalize emotions, externally oriented 
thinking style, poverty of fantasy life, and poor empathy 
(14). This personality construct is a risk factor for 
various physical and mental health problems including 
anxiety, depression, compulsive or addictive behaviors, 
physical symptoms, and potentially somatic diseases 
(15). Since a previous study showed that infertile 
females had higher rates of alexithymia than the fertile 
ones (16), it was assumed that the rate of alexithymia 
may differ among infertile females with different levels 
of stress. Therefore, infertile females with PCOS may 
have different levels of alexithymia compared with the 
ones without PCOS.

Although many previous studies indicated that psychiatric 
disorders are common in patients with PCOS 
(2-6), few researches reported psychiatric symptoms 
in females with PCOS and infertility. Diamond et al. 
(16) concluded that female sexual dysfunction does not 
vary between infertile females with PCOS and the ones 
with unexplained infertility. Another study reported that 
infertility did not appear to constitute a risk factor of 
psychological distress in females with PCOS (17). As 
differences in psychological profiles between infertile 
females with PCOS and those without PCOS are not 
clear yet, the current study aimed at comparing the psychological 
profile of these two groups. To the authors’ 
best knowledge, it was the first study that compared psychological 
profiles of infertile females with and without 
PCOS in terms of four domains: infertility stress, 
depression, female sexual dysfunction, and alexithymia 
(i.e. the inability to distinguish and describe feelings and 
the absence of fantasies).

Materials and Methods
Participants
The current case-control study was conducted in Fatemeh 
Azahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research 
Center (Babol, Iran) from May 2016 to December 
2017 on 240 infertile females selected through census 
sampling method. The case group was composed of 120 
females with a definite diagnosis of PCOS. The control 
group was comprised of 120 infertile females without 
PCOS based on Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. Besides, 
the control group was matched with the case group in 
terms of age, level of education, and duration of infertility.

Inclusion criteria for infertile females with and without 
PCOS were being 15-45 years old, completion of 
primary school as the minimum level of education, being 
married and having an active sex life, and lacking 
any problems in speaking or understanding the Persian 
language; also, a definite diagnosis of PCOS was an 
additional criterion for PCOS group. Definite diagnosis 
of PCOS was done based on two of the following Rotterdam 
diagnostic criteria: ultrasound scan of PCOS 
(presence of .12 follicles in one or both ovaries and/
or increased ovarian volume >10 mL), clinical signs of 
hyperandrogenism (hirsutism or obvious acne), and/or 
an elevated plasma testosterone level, and/or irregular 
menstrual periods (interval between menstrual periods 
>35 days, amenorrhea defined as the absence of vaginal 
bleeding for .6 months, and/or variable menstruation) 
(18, 19).

Exclusion criteria for all participants (females with 
and without PCOS) were diagnosis of the husband with 
azoospermia or oligospermia, presence of other disorders 
that could mimic PCOS syndrome such as congenital 
adrenal hyperplasia, thyroid disease, or hyperprolactinemia.

Procedure
Four staff of the infertility center explained the study’s 
objectives to the participants and accordingly, the subjects 
were required to sign the written informed consent 
forms. The staff interviewed the subjects and recorded 
their demographic characteristics, as well as their medical 
and gynecological history. Furthermore, the subjects 
were asked to complete five questionnaires of the study 
including the fertility problem inventory (FPI), the female 
sexual function index (FSFI), the Beck depression 
inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Toronto alexithymia scale 
(TAS-20). First, 258 females (129 with and 129 without 
PCOS) were enrolled of which 240 females with infertility 
(120 with and 120 without PCOS) completed the 
questionnaires. 

Ethical considerations
The current study was approved by the Ethics Committee 
of Babol University of Medical Sciences 
(No.4834).

Measures 
Demographic questionnaire
Demographic characteristics including age, educational 
level, infertility history, clinical information of 
PCOS, and assisted reproductive technology (ART) history 
were obtained from the subjects. In addition, weight 
and height were measured in order to obtain body mass 
index (BMI).

Infertility stress
Infertility stress was assessed using FPI developed by 
Newton in 1999. It is a multi-dimensional tool to detect 
stress and infertility problems. The FPI is comprised 
of 46 questions divided in five subscales: social concern, 
sexual concern, relationship concern, rejection of 
parenthood, and the need for parenthood. Each item is 
scored based on a six-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 
(strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The total score 
ranges from 46 to 276 with higher scores representing 
higher levels of stress (20). Validity and reliability of the 
Persian version of FPI were previously examined (21). 
In the current study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 
the FPI was 0.898.

Sexual function
The FSFI was used to assess sexual function in subjects. 
The FSFI assesses sexual function over the past four 
weeks. It covers six domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, 
orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The score for each domain 
ranges from 0 or 1 to 5 with higher scores representing 
better sexual function (22). It was previously shown that 
the Persian version of FSFI has high validity and reliability 
(23). In the current study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient 
of the FSFI was 0.896.

Depression symptoms
Depression was measured by the BDI-II. It is a self-
reported scale and a screening instrument for depression 
with 21 items, most of which assess depressive symptoms 
on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. Total 
scores range from 0 to 63. In clinical settings, the severity 
of depression based on BDI-II, is classified as follows: 
0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-
28: moderate depression; and 29-63: severe depression 
(24). A valid Persian version of the BID-II was used in 
the current study. The internal consistency (Cronbach’s 
alpha=0.87) and test re-test reliability (r=0.74) of the 
BID-II Persian was high and acceptable (25). In the current 
study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the BDI-II 
was 0.915.

Alexithymia
In the current study, alexithymia was assessed using 
TAS-20. It is one of the most common instruments to 
measure alexithymia that has 20 items in three subscales: 
difficulty to describe emotions, difficulty to 
identify feelings (DIF), and externally-oriented thinking. 
Items are scored based on a five-point Likert 
scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly 
agree). The total alexithymia score ranges from 20 to 
100 (26). A study conducted by Besharat supported the 
internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent 
validity of the Persian version of TAS-20 (27). In 
the current study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 
the TAS-20 was 0.809.

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows, 
version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To present 
characteristics of females with and without PCOS, 
continuous variables are expressed as mean ± SD and 
categorical variables as numbers (%). Chi-square test 
was employed to compare categorical variables such 
as educational attainment level, duration of infertility, 
regularity of menstruation, and BMI between the two 
groups. Also, independent samples t test was employed 
to compare the means of age and duration of marriage 
between the two groups. In addition, comparisons of 
the mean scores between females with PCOS and those 
without PCOS in all four questionnaires and their subscales 
including FPI, FSFI, TAS-20, and BDI-II, were 
done using independent t test. A P<0.0.5 was considered 
statistically significant.

Results
Table 1 provides the summarized demographic information 
of subjects in the two groups. There were no 
significant differences between the two groups regarding 
the subjects’ age, husbands’ age, educational level 
of the subjects, educational level of their husbands, and 
duration of infertility (P>0.05 in all cases). The frequency 
of irregular menstruation was significantly higher 
in females with PCOS than the ones without PCOS 
(P<0.001).

Of the subscales of infertility stress, the mean scores of 
social stress and rejection of life without child were higher 
in females with PCOS than those of the other group 
(P=0.024 and P=0.021, respectively). There were no significant 
differences in the mean scores of subscales of 
sexual stress, marital stress, and parental stress between 
the two groups. Also, females with PCOS had higher total 
mean scores of alexithymia symptoms (TAS-20) than 
the ones without PCOS (59.83 ± 11.36 vs. 55.69 ± 11.52, 
P=0.005). Of the subscales of TAS-20, DIF and difficulty 
to describe feeling were significantly higher in females 
with PCOS than the ones in the other group (P<0.001 and 
P=0.015, respectively). There was no significant difference 
between the two groups in the mean scores of depression 
symptoms. In addition, severity of depressive 
symptoms did not significantly differ between the two 
groups (18.06 ± 12.03 vs. 15.65 ± 11.76, P=0.121). Total 
scores of FSFI and all its six subscales did not significantly 
differ between the two groups (25.13 ± 3.95 vs. 25.35 
± 3.87, P=0.660).

Discussion
The current study aimed at comparing the psychological 
profiles of infertile females with PCOS with those of 
women without PCOS. The results showed that females 
with PCOS had higher total mean scores of infertility 
stress (FPI) than the ones without PCOS. Infertile females 
with PCOS had more social concerns than the ones 
in the other group. Also, infertile females with PCOS had 
more stress of rejection of life without child than the other 
group. To the authors' best knowledge, no published study 
has examined various aspects of infertility stress in infertile 
females with and without PCOS. However, some studies 
evaluated social relationships in patients with PCOS 
compared to the controls. Such studies reported that the 
social relationships of patients with PCOS was more impaired 
compared to the normal population (28, 29). A recent 
study on the development of specific measurements 
of quality of life in patients with PCOS emphasized on the 
negative effects of PCOS on family and friends and social 
relationships (30). Consistently, another study reported 
that the majority of females with PCOS (76.1%) worried 
about their future life without any children (15).

Now, higher intensity of infertility stress observed in infertile 
females with PCOS compared to the ones without 
PCOS, should be explained. There are some hypotheses 
to explain this finding. First, the secondary analysis of the 
data showed that symptoms of PCOS such as obesity and 
hirsutism were related to infertility stress. Second, some 
previous studies confirmed that females with PCOS experienced 
social pressure due to hirsutism, especially excessive 
facial hair (31). A study showed that hirsutism score 
of females with PCOS was significantly correlated with 
mental health status (32). Infertile females with PCOS 
that had hirsutism felt “unfeminine” and “different” (33). 
Therefore, social concerns of infertile females with PCOS 
may be more than those of the ones without PCOS.

In contrast with the current study’s expectation, the total 
scores of FSFI and all of its six subscales did not significantly 
differ between females with PCOS and those without 
PCOS. Results of some previous studies were consistent 
with the findings of the present study reporting that 
females with PCOS did not have more depression symptoms 
than the ones without PCOS (34, 35). However, a 
study reported that infertile females with PCOS had significantly 
higher depression scores compared to the ones 
without PCOS (36). A study reported that females with 
PCOS with ones with no desire for a child did not show 
significant differences in specific aspects of sexual satisfaction 
compared to the ones with no desire for a child 
(17). A recent study reported no significant difference in 
female sexual dysfunction disorders between infertile females 
with PCOS and those without PCOS (16).

The current study also aimed at comparing the alexithymia 
between infertile females with and those without 
PCOS. The results of the current study indicated that infertile 
females with PCOS had higher alexithymia scores 
than the ones without PCOS. Infertile females with PCOS 
had more difficulty to identify their feelings and describe 
their emotions compared to the ones without PCOS. To 
the authors’ best knowledge, no previous study assessed 
the alexithymia in infertile females with PCOS. Although 
the current study did not have enough information about 
the reasons for higher alexithymia in females with PCOS 
compared to the ones without PCOS, several hypotheses 
could be proposed. First, there are associations between 
alexithymia and maladaptation to stress. A study investigated 
the association between alexithymia and fertility-
related stress in females with infertility demonstrated that 
alexithymia was related to fertility-related stress. The 
authors concluded that alexithymia acted as a secondary 
coping strategy in females with infertility (37). Second, 
alexithymia is related to somatization disorders. A recent 
meta-analysis reported that females with PCOS were more 
likely to have higher somatization disorders compared to 
the ones without PCOS (38). Third, another study introduced 
alexithymia and somatization as the consequences 
of maladaptation to stress of infertility (39). Therefore, it 
is supposed that high somatization in females with PCOS 
and infertility was comorbid with alexithymia and higher 
infertility stress than ones without PCOS.

Due to some limitations of the current study, data 
should be interpreted with caution. First, the case-control 
nature of the current study prevents drawing any conclusions 
concerning possible relationships. Prospective 
cohort studies in the area using reliable approaches are 
required to describe the casual relationship between infertile 
females with PCOS and those without PCOS. Second, 
data was collected using self-report scales that may result 
in underreporting of the conditions. Future studies using 
more reliable methods such as interviewing, might give a 
better picture of the psychological profile of infertile females 
with PCOS. Third, all of the patients included in 
the current study were recruited from one hospital, rather 
than multiple centers, that could be a limitation of the current 
study. Fourth, the study sample was small and cannot 
be generalized to numerous phenotypes of PCOS. Further, 
multi-centered studies with larger sample sizes are 
recommended. Finally, since the study was the first work 
that showed higher alexithymia in infertile females with 
PCOS, more studies in the area should investigate the extent 
of the associations between alexithymia and PCOS 
in females with infertility. Additionally, future studies are 
required to clarify how alexithymia arises in infertile females 
with PCOS.

Conclusion
The current study results showed that infertile females 
with PCOS experience more infertility stress than the 
ones without PCOS. Also, infertile females with PCOS 
had higher means of alexithymia, especially with respect 
to the ability to distinguish and describe, compared to the 
ones without PCOS. The results of the current study indicated 
that infertility care providers should provide more 
psychosocial support for infertile females with PCOS. 
The current study was a step to present the profiles of infertile 
females with PCOS; thus, further longitudinal studies 
are required to follow the changes in psychological 
profiles of females with and without PCOS during infertility 
treatment.
