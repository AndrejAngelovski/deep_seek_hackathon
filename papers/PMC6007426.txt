Background
The genetic basis of animal domestication remains poorly understood, and systems with
substantial phenotypic differences between wild and domestic populations are useful for
elucidating the genetic basis of adaptation to new environments as well as the genetic
basis of rapid phenotypic change. Here, we sequenced the whole genome of 78 individual
ducks, from two wild and seven domesticated populations, with an average sequencing
depth of 6.42X per individual.

Results
Our population and demographic analyses indicate a complex history of domestication,
with early selection for separate meat and egg lineages. Genomic comparison of wild to
domesticated populations suggests that genes that affect brain and neuronal development
have undergone strong positive selection during domestication. Our FST
analysis also indicates that the duck white plumage is the result of selection at the
melanogenesis-associated transcription factor locus.

Conclusions
Our results advance the understanding of animal domestication and selection for complex
phenotypic traits.

Background
Animal domestication was one of the major contributory factors to the agricultural
revolution during the Neolithic period, which resulted in a shift in human lifestyle from
hunting to farming [1]. Compared with their wild
progenitors, domesticated animals showed notable changes in behavior, morphology,
physiology, and reproduction [2]. Detecting
domestication-mediated selective signatures is important for understanding the genetic basis
of both adaptation to new environments and rapid phenotype change [3, 4]. In recent years, to
characterize signatures of domestication, whole-genome resequencing studies have been
performed on a wide range of agricultural animals, including pig [5], sheep [6], rabbit [7], and chicken [8, 9].

Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are the world's most widely distributed and
agriculturally important waterfowl species and are of particular economic importance in Asia
[10]. Southeast Asia, particularly southern
China, is the major center of duck domestication, with records indicating duck farming in
the region dating at least 2,000 years [11, 12], particularly in wet environments [13] associated with rice crops [14]. In the absence of archaeological evidence, the exact timing of
domestication and the time of meat and egg type ducks split remains unknown, with the first
written records of domestic ducks in central China shortly after 500 BC [15].

It is clear that the domesticated duck originated from mallards [16], and domestic ducks can be classified as those produced primarily
for meat (similar to chicken broilers) or eggs (similar to chicken layer lines). Together
with the timing of duck domestication, the relative separation of duck meat and egg lines is
also unknown. It is unclear whether ducks were domesticated once and subsequently selected
for divergent meat and egg production traits or whether meat and egg populations were
derived independently in two domestication events from wild mallards.

Moreover, domesticated mallards show many important behavioral [17] and morphological [18–20] differences from their wild
ancestors, particularly related to plumage and neuroanatomy. However, the genetic basis of
these phenotypic differences is still poorly understood.

Data Description
In order to determine the timing of duck domestication in China, as well as identify the
genomic regions under selection during domestication, we performed whole-genome resequencing
from 78 individuals belonging to seven duck breeds (three for meat breeds, three for egg
breeds, and one dual-purpose breed) and two geographically distinct wild populations. Using
the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as small insertions and
deletions (INDELs), we tested for population structure between domesticated and wild
populations and we assessed the genome for signatures of selection associated with
domestication. We tested alternative demographic scenarios with the pairwise sequential
Markovian coalescent method combined with the diffusion approximation method.

Analyses
Genetic variation
We individually sequenced 22 wild and 56 domestic ducks from two wild populations and
seven domestic breeds (three meat breeds, three egg breeds, and one dual-purpose breed)
from across China (Fig.1A) to an average of 6.42X
coverage per individual (613.37 Gb of high-quality paired-end sequence data) after
filtering and quality control, resulting in 535 billion mappable reads across 78 ducks
(Supplemental Table S1).

Figure 1: Experimental design and variants statistics. A)null Sampling sites in this study. A
total of 78 ducks from two wild populations (mallard Ningxia [MDN] n = 8; mallard
Zhejiang [MDZ] n = 14), three meat breeds (Pekin [PK] n = 8; Cherry Valley [CV] n = 8;
maple leaf [ML] n = 8), three egg breeds (Jin Ding [JD] n = 8; Shan Ma [SM] n = 8;
Shao Xing [SX] n = 8), and one dual-purpose breed (Gao You [GY] n = 8) were selected.
B) Genomic variation of nine populations. Mean number of SNPs and heterozygous and
homozygous SNP ratio in the nine populations are shown at the bottom. Nucleotide
diversity ratios of the nine populations are shown at the middle. The nucleotide
diversity ratios in wild mallards are dramatically higher than ratios in domesticated
ducks. Number of insertions and deletions in the nine populations are shown at the
top. The number of deletions was higher than the number of insertions in all nine
populations.

Across samples, we identified 39.2 million variants, consisting of 36.1 million SNPs
(average per sample = 4.5 m SNPs; range = 2.34 – 9.52 M SNPs) and 3.1 million INDELs
(average per sample = 0.4 million INDELs; range = 0.21 – 0.89 million INDELs) (Fig.1B, Supplemental Figs. S1 and S2, Supplemental Table S2). Single base-pair INDELs were the most common, accounting
for 38.63% of all detected INDELs (Supplemental Table S3). Our dataset covers 96.2% of the duck dbSNP database
deposited in the Genome Variation Map (GVM) [21].
In general, domesticated populations showed lower number of SNPs (t test,
P = 3.13 × 10−12) and nucleotide diversity
(t test, P = 2.20 × 10−16) compared to wild
mallards (Fig.1B). Moreover, homozygosity in
domesticated ducks was significantly higher than ratios in wild mallards
(t test, P = 1.35 × 10−10) consistent with
the larger panmictic wild population or with the higher artificial selection and
inbreeding within domesticated stocks.

Population structure and domestication
Phylogenetic relationships, based on a neighbor-joining of pairwise genetic distances of
whole-genome SNPs (Fig.2A) and principal component
analysis (PCA; Fig.2B), revealed strong clustering
into three distinct genetic groups. In general, we observed separate clusters
corresponding to wild ducks (MDN and MDZ), ducks domesticated for meat production (PK, CV,
and ML), and ducks domesticated for egg production (JD, SM, and SX). The dual-purpose
domesticate (GY) clustered with ducks domesticated for egg production (Fig.2B and C).

inferred Ne dynamics. The lines represent inferred population sizes and the gray
shaded areas indicate the Pleistocene period, with Last Glacial Period (LGP) shown in
darker gray, and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) shown in light blue areas.

We further performed population structure analysis using FRAPPE [22], which estimates individual ancestry and admixture proportions
assuming K ancestral populations (Fig. 2C). With K
= 2, a clear division was found between wild-type ducks (MDN and MDZ) and domesticated
ducks (PK, CV, ML, JD, SM, SX, and GY). With K = 3, a clear division was found between
meat type ducks (PK, CV, and ML) and egg type ducks mixed with dual-purpose type ducks
(JD, SM, SX, and GY).

Next, we explored the demographic history of our samples to differentiate whether
domestication of meat- and egg-producing ducks was the result of one or multiple events.
First, we estimated changes in effective population size (Ne) in our three
genetic clusters in a pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) framework [23]. The meat type ducks (PK, CV, and ML) showed
concordant demographic trajectories with egg and mixture dual-purpose type populations
(JD, SM, SX, and GY), with one apparent expansion around the Penultimate Glaciation Period
(0.30-0.13 million years ago) [4, 24] and Last Glacial Period (110–12 thousand years
ago) [25, 26], followed by a subsequent contraction (Fig. 2D). Next, we tested multiple demographic scenarios related to domestication
using a diffusion approximation method for the allele frequency spectrum (∂a∂i) (Supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Among
the four isolation models tested (models 1 – 4), the model of a single domestication with
subsequent divergence of the domesticated breeds (model 2) was both consistent with our
population structure results (Fig.2) and had the
lowest Akaike information criteria (AIC) value, indicating a better overall fit to the
data (log-likelihood = –33 388.43; AIC = 66 788) (Supplemental Fig. S3).

Demographic parameters estimated from the single domestication model (model 2) indicated
that domestication occurred 2,228 years ago, with 95% confidence interval (CI) ± 441 years
ago, followed by a rapid subsequent divergence of the meat breed from the egg/dual-purpose
breeds roughly 100 years after the initial domestication event (Table1). Our results suggest that following an initial
bottleneck associated with domestication, with an estimated Ne of 320 (95% CI ±
3) individuals for the ancestral domesticated population, the population has expanded to
the current Ne of 5,597 (95% CI ± 1,195) and 12,988 (95% CI ± 2,877) in the
meat type and egg/dual purpose breeds, respectively. Ne estimates for
domesticated breeds are lower than the Ne of 88,842 (95% CI ±18,065) in wild mallards,
consistent with the large panmictic wild population.

Best fit parameter estimates for the model of a single domestication event followed
by divergence of the domesticated breeds, including changes in population size. The
95% confidence intervals were obtained from 100 bootstrap datasets. Time estimates
are given in years and migration are in units of number of migrants per
generation.

Gene flow estimates were relatively high, with 1 and 4 migrants per generation from the
meat and egg/dual-purpose breeds, respectively, into the wild population. Our results
suggest duck domestication was a recent single domestication event followed by rapid
subsequent selection for separate meat and egg/dual-purpose breeds.

Selection for plumage color
Derived traits in domesticated animals tend to evolve in a predictable order, with color
variation appearing in the earliest stages of domestication, followed by coat or plumage
and structural (skeletal and soft tissue) variation, and finally behavioral differences
[27, 28]. One of the simplest and most visible derived traits of ducks is white
plumage color. In order to detect the signature of selection associated with white
feathers, we searched the duck genome for regions with high FST between the
populations of white-feather (PK, CV, and ML) and non-white-feather (MDN, MDZ, JD, SX, and
GY) birds based on sliding 10-kbwindows. We identified a region of high differentiation
between white-plumage and non-white-plumage ducks overlapping the melanogenesis associated
transcription factor (MITF; FST = 0.69) (Fig. 3A). In the intronic region of MITF,
we identified 13 homozygous SNPs and 2 homozygous INDELs present in all white-plumage
breeds (n = 24) and absent in all non-white-plumage breeds (n = 54) (Fig.3B). These mutations were completely associated with
the white-plumage phenotype, suggesting a causative mutation at the MITF
locus. Moreover, to validate the reliability of variants detected in MITF gene, we
amplified the first three SNPs (SNP817793, SNP817818, and SNP818004) and all INDELs by
diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with Sanger sequencing in the 78
white- and non-white-plumage ducks. The results show that the three SNPs and INDEL817958
completely match our NGS analysis (Supplemental Fig. S5). For INDEL818495, we were unable to design a suitable PCR
primer to amplify this region.

ducks. A) FST plot around the MITF locus. The FST value of MITF is highest
for scaffold KB742527.1, circled in red. Each plot represent a 10-kb window. B) The 13
homozygous SNPs and 2 homozygous INDELs were identified in white-plumage ducks and
absent in non-white-plumage ducks. SNPs and INDELs were named according to their
position on the scaffold.

Selection for other domestication traits
In order to detect the signature of selection for other traits associated with duck
domestication, we scanned the duck genome for regions with a high coefficient of
nucleotide differentiation (FST) among the populations of wild (MDN and MDZ)
and domesticated (PK, CV, ML, JD, SM, SX, and GY) ducks based on 10-kbsliding windows, as
well as global FST between each population (Supplemental Table S4). Owing to the
complex and partly unresolved demographic history of these populations, it is difficult to
define a strict threshold that distinguishes true sweeps from regions of homozygosity
caused by drift. We therefore also calculated the pairwise diversity ratio
(θπ(wild/domesticated)). We identified 292 genes in the top
5% of both FST and θπ scores, putatively under
positive selection during domestication (Fig. 4A,
Supplemental Table S5).

domesticated population ducks. A) Distribution of θπ ratios θπ (wild/domesticated) and
Z(FST) values, which are calculated by 10-kbwindows with 5-kbsteps. Only
scaffolds >10 kbwere used for our calculation, as FST results calculated
on a small scaffold are unlikely to be accurate. Red data points located to the
top-right regions correspond to the 5% right tails of empirical
log2 (θπ wild/θπ
domestic) ratio distribution, and the top 5% empirical Z(FST)
distribution are genomic regions under selection during duck domestication. The two
horizontal and vertical gray lines represent the top 5% value of Z(FST)
(2.216) and log2 (θπ wild/θπ

****P value from t test (P <

All 292 genes located in the top 5% FST regions were used for the gene
ontology GO (The framework for the model of biology, which provides the most comprehensive
rescoure currently available for computable knowledge regarding the functions of genes and
gene products) analysis, resulting in a total of 57 GO enrichment terms (Supplementary Table S6). Because
domesticated ducks are known to differ from wild ducks in body size, body fat percentage,
behavior, egg productivity, growth speed, and flight capability, we focused our analysis
on GO annotations of neural-related processes, lipid metabolism and energy metabolism,
reproduction, and skeletal muscle contraction for our 292 putative positive selection
genes. In this reduced data set, the neuro-synapse-axon and lipid-energy metabolism
pathways were overrepresented (Supplemental Table S7) in our list of genes under selection.

From the highlighted GO terms, 25 neuro-synapse-axon genes were identified as being under
positive selection, with six (ADGRB3, EFNA5,
GRIN3A, GRIK2, SYNGAP1, and
HOMER1) in the top 1% of FST and
θπ (Supplemental Table S8). In particular, GRIK2 (glutamate
receptor, ionotropic kainate 2) and GRIN3A (glutamate receptor, subunit
3A) both showed high FST and θπ value compared to
neighboring regions, suggesting functional importance (Fig. 3B, Supplemental
Tables S5, S8).

Beyond the neuronal-synapse-axon genes, 115 genes were identified in the four lipid- and
energy-related pathways with high FST and θπ
values, particularly related to fatty acid metabolism. Among these genes, 37 were found
with both parameters yielding top 1% ranked values (Supplemental Table S8) such as
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) and
patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 8 (PNPLA8).

To infer whether selection extends beyond allelic variation and also affects gene
expression, we compared individual gene expression in the brain, liver, and breast muscle
between seven wild mallards and seven domesticated ducks in natural states with
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) (Supplemental
Table S9). We detected three genes (PDC, MLPH,
and NID2) in the brain, two genes (MAPK12 and
BST1) in the liver, and no genes in breast muscle with significantly
different expression between wild and domesticated ducks. Of the five differentially
expressed genes, PDC was the only gene that also showed evidence of a
selective sweep at the genomic level (Supplemental Table S5, Fig.3C and D). The results suggest that the PDC
gene is of substantial functional importance in phenotypic differentiation among wild and
domestic ducks.

Discussion
Domesticated animals have contributed greatly to human society and human population growth
by providing a stable source of animal protein, fat, and accessory products such as leather
and feathers (including down). To illuminate the genetic trajectories of duck domestication,
we performed whole-genome sequencing of 78 ducks including seven domesticate breeds and two
wild populations. This is the first study to characterize the genetic architecture,
phylogenetic relationships, and domestication history of domesticated ducks and wild
mallards.

Using this powerful dataset and a suite of cutting-edge population genomic and functional
genetic analyses, we observed higher mean variant numbers and nucleotide diversity for the
wild mallard populations compared to the domestics, consistent with both a greater panmictic
mallard population as well as recent sweeps associated with domestication.

Population structure and domestication
We observed a large expansion of the duck population at the interglacial period, which
could be the result of beneficial climatic changes including rising temperatures and sea
levels. In contrast, the glacial maximum coincided with a reduction in population size,
consistent with harsher conditions and limited access to arctic breeding grounds [4, 29–31]. The demographic pattern we observe in wild ducks
is similar to that observed in wild boars [5],
wild yaks [32], and wild horses [33]. However, it is worth noting that although PSMC
is a powerful method to infer changes in Ne over time, it is also sensitive to
deviations from a neutral model. The effects of genetic drift and/or selection could lead
to time-dependent estimates of mutation rate and could bias our estimates of population
expansion [26].

We observed three genetic clusters, with wild mallard, meat breeds, and egg/dual purpose
breeds each representing unique groups. These results suggest either a single
domestication event followed by subsequent breed-specific selection or two separate
domestication events. In order to distinguish alternative models of domestication, we
modeled population demographics and found strong support for a single domestication event
roughly 2,200 years ago, with the rapid subsequent selection for separate meat and
egg/dual-purpose breeds roughly 100 generations later. Difficulty in differentiating
between very recent divergence and high migration rates in the frequency spectrum
prevented convergence between independent runs when trying to fit other migration
parameters to our model. We note that the evolutionary history of wild mallards and
domesticated duck breeds is likely to be more complex than the simple demographic
scenarios modeled here, and further studies may be needed to fully capture the
evolutionary dynamics of duck domestication. Given the recent origin of wild ducks, as
well as the high levels of diversity we observe in the wild and domestic duck genomes, it
is not possible to differentiate recent admixture from incomplete lineage sorting with our
current data. This issue has important conservation implications and represents an
interesting area for future study. Nevertheless, the time estimates obtained with our
model are compatible with previous written records from 500 BC [15].

Selection for white plumage
Plumage color is an important domestication trait, and we compared breeds with white
plumage to those with colored plumage. We identified high levels of divergence in the
intronic region of the MITF gene, an important developmental locus with a
complex regulation implicated in pigmentation and melanocyte development in several
vertebrate species [34–36], including Japanese quail [37], dog [38], and duck [39, 40].

Selection for other domestication traits
In order to identify those genomic regions that have been the target of selection during
domestication, we used estimates of diversity between wild and domestic samples, retaining
those 292 genes in the top 5% of both FST and θπ
values for further analysis. These genes were overrepresented for both neural
developmental and lipid metabolism, suggesting that these functionalities were under
strong selection during domestication. Two loci, GRIK2 and GRIN3A, showed
particularly strong signs of selective sweeps presumably associated with domestication.
GRIK2 encodes a subunit of a glutamate receptor that has a role in
synaptic plasticity and is important for learning and memory. GRIN3A
encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which are expressed abundantly in
the human cerebral cortex [41] and are involved
in the development of synaptic elements.

We also identified five genes with significantly different expression in the brain and
liver of domesticated ducks compared to their wild ancestor. One of these,
PDC also showed evidence of selective sweeps at the genomic level.
PDC encodes phosducin, a photoreceptor-specific protein that is highly
expressed in the retina and the pineal gland [42], as well as the brain [43].

Our results suggest that PDC, GRIK2, and
GRIN3A may have played a crucial role in duck domestication by altering
functional regulation of the developing brain and nervous system. This finding is
consistent with theories that behavioral traits are the most critical in the initial steps
of animal domestication, allowing animals to tolerate humans and captivity [44, 45].
Indeed, compared to wild mallards, domestic ducks are more docile, less vigilant, and show
important differences in brain morphology [17,
18]. Interestingly, differences between wild
and domesticated animals in brain and nervous system functions due to directional
selection were also observed in domestication studies of rabbits [7], dogs [46], and chickens
[8]. In particular, GRIK2 was
also found to play a crucial role during rabbit domestication [7].

In addition to brain- and nervous system-related genes, we also identified several genes
that play an important function in lipid and energy metabolism. For example,
PIK3C3 plays an important role in ATP binding but also regulates brain
development and axons of cortical neurons [47–51]. PNPLA8 is
involved in facilitating lipid storage in adipocyte tissue energy mobilization and
maintains mitochondrial integrity [52, 53], as well as plays a role in lipid metabolism
associated with neurodegenerative diseases [54–56]. PRKAR2B is
associated with body weight regulation, hyperphagia, and other energy metabolism [57, 58].

Taken together, our results show that duck domestication was a relatively recent and
complex process, and the genetic basis of domestication traits show many striking overlaps
with other vertebrate domestication events. The whole-genome resequencing data and SNP and
INDEL variant datasets are valuable resources for researchers studying evolution,
domestication, and trait discovery and for breeders of Anas
platyrhynchos. Furthermore, the data represent a foundation for development of
new, ultrahigh-density variant screening arrays for duck population level trait analysis
and genomic selection.

Methods
Sample selection
A total of 78 ducks were chosen for sequencing, seven populations of domesticated ducks
and two populations of mallards from different geographic regions. The domesticated ducks
include three meat type populations, i.e., Pekin duck (PK; n = 8), Cherry Valley duck (CV;
n = 8), and maple leaf duck (ML; n = 8); three egg type populations, i.e., Jin Ding duck
(JD; n = 8), Shao Xing duck (SX; n = 8), and Shan Ma duck (SM; n = 8); one egg and meat
dual-purpose type (DP type) population, i.e., Gao You duck (GY; n = 8); and two wild
populations come from two provinces in China separated by nearly 2,000 km, i.e., mallard
from Ningxia Province (MDN; n = 8) and mallardform Zhejiang Province (MDZ; n = 14). The
classification of production types follow the description of Animal Genetic Resources in
China Poultry [59]. PK, CV, and ML ducks
originated from Beijing; JD and SM ducks originated from Fujian Province; and SX and GY
ducks originated from Jiangsu Province. Whole blood samples were collected from brachial
veins of ducks by standard venipuncture.

In addition, 14 male ducks (MDNM, n = 3; MDZM, n = 4; PKM, n = 1; CVM, n = 1; MLM, n = 1;
JDM, n = 1; SMM, n = 1; SXM, n = 1; GYM, n = 1) were chosen for RNA-seq.

Sequencing and mapping statistic of individual ducks in genome and transcriptome analyses
are detailed in the Supplementary
files (Supplemental Tables S1,
S7).

Sequencing and library preparation
Genomic DNA was extracted using the standard phenol/chloroform extraction method. For
each sample, two paired-end libraries (500 bp) were constructed according to the
manufacturer's protocols (Illumina) and sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 sequencing
platform. We sequenced each sample at 5X depth in order to reduce the false-negative rate
of variants due to our strict filter criteria. We randomly selected one individual for 10X
coverage, except for the MDN population, where we sequenced seven individuals at 5X
coverage and random one at 20X coverage and the MDZ population, where we sequenced all
individuals at 10X coverage. We generated 628.37 Gb of paired-end reads of 100 bp (or 150
bp; MDZ) length (Supplemental Table
S1).

The mRNA from brain, liver, and breast muscle of 14 ducks were extracted using the
standard trizol extraction methods. For each sample, two paired-end libraries (500 bp)
were constructed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Illumina). All samples were
sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencing platform with the coverage of 6X. We
generated 278.62 Gb of paired-end reads of 150 bp length (Supplemental Table S9).

Read alignment and variant calling
To avoid low-quality reads, mainly the result of base-calling duplicates and adapter
contamination, we filtered out sequences according to the default parameters of NGS QC
Toolkit (v2.3.3) [60]. Those paired reads that
passed Illumina's quality control filter were aligned using BWA-MEM (v0.7.12) to version
1.0 of the Anas platyrhynchos genome (BGI_duck_1.0) [10]. Duplicate reads were removed from individual
sample alignments using Picard tools MarkDuplicates, and reads were merged using
MergeSamFiles [61].

The Genome Analysis Toolkit v3.5 (GATK, RRID:SCR_001876),
RealignerTargetCreator, and IndelRealigner protocol were used for global realignment of
reads around INDELs before variant calling [62,
63]. SNPs and small INDELs (1–50 bp) were
called using the GATK UnifiedGenotyper set for diploids with the parameter of a minimum
quality score of 20 for both mapped reads and bases to call variants, similar to previous
studies [64–68]. We filtered variants both per population and per individual using GATK
according to the stringent filtering criteria. For SNPs of population filter: a) QUAL
>30.0; b) QD >5.0; c) FS <60.0; d) MQ >40.0; e) MQRankSum >-12.5; and f)
ReadPosRankSum >-8.0.Additionally, if there were more than 3 SNPs clustered in a
10-bpwindow, all three SNPs were considered as false positives and removed [69].

We used the following population criteria to identify INDELs: QUAL >30.0, QD >5.0,
FS <200.0, ReadPosRankSum >-20.0. Of individual filters, we also removed all INDELs
and SNPs where the depth of derived variants was less than half the depth of the sequence.
All SNPs and INDELs were assigned to specific genomic regions and genes using SnpEff v4.0
(SnpEff, RRID:SCR_005191) [70] based on the Ensembl duck annotations. After
filtering, 36,107,949 SNPs and 3,082,731 INDELs were identified (Supplemental Table S2).

SNP validation
In order to evaluate the reliability of our data, we compared our SNPs to the duck dbSNP
database deposited in the GVM at the Big Data Center at the Beijing Institute of Genomics,
Chinese Academy of Science [71]. A total of
7,908,722 SNPs were validated in the duck dbSNP database, which covered 96.2% of the
database (Supplemental Table
S2). For the 28,199,227 SNPs not confirmed by dbSNPs, 390 randomly selected
nucleotide sites were further validated using diagnostic PCR combined with Sanger sequence
method described in previous researchM [8, 72, 73]. The
result showed 100% accuracy, indicating the high reliability of the called SNP variation
identified in this study.

Population structure
We removed all SNPs with a minor allele frequency < = 0.1 and kept only SNPs that
occurred in more than 90% of individuals. Vcf files were converted to hapmap format with
custom perl scripts and to PLINK format file by GLU v1.0b3 [74] and PLINK v1.90 (PLINK, RRID:SCR_001757) [75, 76],
when appropriate. We used GCTA (v1.25) [77] for
PCA, first by generating the genetic relationship matrix from which the first 20
eigenvectors were extracted.

To estimate individual admixture assuming different numbers of clusters, the population
structure was investigated using FRAPPE v1.1 [22]
base on all high-quality SNPs information, with a maximum likelihood method. We increased
the coancestry clusters spanning from 2 to 4 (Supplemental Fig. S6), because there are four duck types (wild, meat,
egg, and dual-purpose) across the nine duck populations, with 10,000 iterations per
run.

A distance matrix was generated by calculating the pairwise allele sharing distance for
each pair of all high-quality SNPs. Multiple alignment of the sequences was performed with
MUSCLE v3.8 (MUSCLE, RRID:SCR_011812) [78]. A neighbor-joining maximum likelihood
phylogenetic tree was constructed with the DNAML program in the PHYLIP package v3.69
(PHYLIP, RRID:SCR_006244) [79] and MEGA7 [80, 81]. All implementation was
performed according to the recommended manipulations of SNPhylo [82].

Demographic history reconstruction
The demographic history of both wild and domesticated ducks was inferred using a hidden
Markov model approach as implemented in pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescence based
on SNP distributions [23]. In order to determine
which PSMC (v0.6.5) settings were most appropriate for each population, we reset the
number of free atomic time intervals (-p option), upper limit of time to most recent
common ancestor (-t option), and initial value of r = θ/ρ (-r option) according to
previous research [26] and online suggestions by
Li and Durbin [83]. Based on estimates from the
chicken genome, an average mutation rate (μ) of 1.191 × 10-9 per base per
generation and a generation time (g) of 1 year were used for analysis [84].

Three-population demographic inference was performed using a diffusion-based approach as
implemented in the program ∂a∂i (v1.7) [85]. To
minimize potential effects of selection that could interfere with demographic inference,
these analyses were performed using the subset of noncoding regions across the whole
genome and spanning 750,939,264 bp in length. Noncoding SNPs were then thinned to 1% to
alleviate potential linkage between the markers. The final dataset consisted of 95,181
SNPs with an average distance of 7,112 bp (± 18,810 bp) between neighboring SNPs. To
account for missing data, the folded allele frequency spectrum for the three populations
(wild, meat, and egg/dual-purpose breeds) was projected down in ∂a∂i to the projection
that maximized the number of segregating SNPs, resulting in 92,966 SNPs.

We tested four scenarios to reconstruct the demographic history of the domesticated
breeds of mallards: simultaneous domestication of the meat and egg and dual-purpose breeds
(model 1); a single domestication event followed by divergence of the meat and egg and
dual-purpose breeds (model 2); two independent domestication events, with the meat type
breed being domesticated first (model 3); and two independent domestication events, with
the egg and dual-purpose breeds being domesticated first (model 4). Using the “backbone”
of the best model, we then used a step-wise strategy to add parameters related with
variation in population sizes and population growth, keeping a new parameter only if the
AIC and log likelihood improved considerably over the previous model with fewer
parameters. In cases where additional parameters resulted in negligibly improved AIC and
likelihood, we retained the simpler, less parameterized model. Gene flow was modeled as
continuous migration events after population divergence. Each model was run at least 10
times from independent starting values to ensure convergence to the same parameter
estimates. We rejected models where we failed to obtain convergence across the replicate
runs. Scaled parameters for the best-supported model were transformed into real values
using the same average mutation rate (μ) and (g) as
described above for the PSMC analysis. Parameter uncertainty was obtained using the
Godambe information matrix [86] from 100
nonparametric bootstraps.

Selective-sweep analysis
In order to define candidate regions that have undergone directional selection during
duck domestication, we calculated the coefficient of nucleotide differentiation
(FST) between mallards and domesticated ducks described by Weir and Cockerham
[87]. We calculated the average FST
in 10-kbwindows with a 5-kbshift for all seven domesticated duck populations combined and
two mallard populations combined. Only scaffolds longer than 10 kb, 2,368 of 78,488
scaffolds, were chosen for the analysis. We transformed observed FST values to
Z transformation (Z(FST)) with μ = 0.1154 and σ = 0.0678 according to
previously described methods [88].

To estimate levels of nucleotide diversity (π) across all sampled populations, we used
the VCFtools software (v0.1.13) [89] to calculate
θπ(wild/domesticated) [90], computing the average
difference per locus over each pair of accessions. As the measurement of FST,
averaged π ratio (θπ(wild/domesticated)) was calculated for each scaffold in 10–kbsliding
windows.

Functional classification of GO categories was performed in Database for Annotation,
Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, v6.8) [91]. Statistical significance was accessed by using a modified Fisher exact test
and Benjamini correction for multiple testing.

RNA-seq and data processing
To infer whether novel allelic variants located in the top 5% FST regions of
genome comparison between wild mallards and domesticated ducks could also affect gene
expression, we compared gene expression in brain, liver, and breast muscle between wild
mallards and domesticated ducks. To make our result more universal, seven male mallards
and seven male domesticated ducks were choose for RNA-seq. All samples were individually
sequenced using the Illumina Highseq 4000 sequencing platform.

For each sample, adapters and primers of paired-end reads were removed using the NGSQC
Tool kit (v2.3.3) [60]. For each paired-end read
pair, if one of two reads had an average base quality less than 20 (PHRED quality score),
then both reads were removed. If one end of a paired-end read had a percentage of
high-quality base less than 70%, the two paired reads were also removed. After that,
high-quality reads were mapped to the reference genome using STAR (v.2.5.3a) [92]. The featureCounts function of
the Rsubread (v.1.5.2) [93,
94] was used to output the counts of reads
aligning to each gene. We detected the differential expression genes with edgeR (v3.6)
[95–98] using a padj <0.05 threshold.
