==== Body
1. Introduction
The group of vitamin B6 unites the water-soluble vitamers pyridoxine (PN, 1), pyridoxal (PL, 2), pyridoxamine (PM, 3) and their respective phosphorylated derivatives pyridoxine 5′-phosphate (PNP), pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) [1,2,3,4] (Figure 1).

Among these, PLP exhibits the highest biological activity and can be provided through in vivo transformation from the other aforementioned vitamers, which allows the enzymatically catalyzed biosynthesis of this vitamin as one of the main cofactors in human metabolism. In this regard, vitamin B6 participates in more than 160 enzymatic reactions, from which a major part includes amino acid biosynthesis and degradation [5,6,7,8,9].

First studies regarding this set of molecules blossomed in connection with the discovery of its function as antineuritic factor back in 1932 [10]. Because of its participation in a manifold of enzymatic reactions, the B6 group currently found its way into a various research fields, but nevertheless is mostly topical in medical research. Its correlation was examined inter alia to Parkinson’s disease [11], rheumatoid arthritis [12], depression [13], schizophrenia [14] antibacterial activity [15] and cancer [16,17]. Its potential as an antioxidant thus increasing resistance towards biotic and abiotic stress was also a matter of discussion [18]. Pyridoxine and its vitamers attracted further attention as it has been found to inhibit starch hydrolyzing enzymes in the GI tract and, therefore, may be potentially active in prevention of type2 diabetes [19].

Synthetic approaches towards this group of vitamers, and in this regard specifically PN, started in 1939, on the one hand, by investigating a pyridone-condensation (b) from ethyl acetylacetate and cyanoacetamide as starting materials and, on the other hand, via oxidative degradation of isoquinoline derivatives (a) [20,21,22,23] (Scheme 1).

Other retrosynthetic strategies described the condensation of N-alkyl- or N-arylalkyl-alanine esters with α-formylsuccinic esters followed by Dieckmann-cyclisation or the assembly of the PN backbone from β-aminocrotononitril and ethyl hydroxymethyleneoxalacetate [24,25].

In 1944, studies regarding the influence of PN on the growth of lactic acid bacteria encouraged the search for further PN-based derivatives, which were later characterized as PL (2), PM (3) [26,27] and their respective phosphates [28,29,30]. Their synthesis commonly involves the formation of an imine derivative prepared by oxidation of PN (1) using manganese compounds in various oxidation states (i.e., KMnO4, MnO2) followed by reaction with amine substrates. Afterwards, acid hydrolysis or hydrogenation using palladium/platinum as catalyst leads to the desired product 2/3 [28,31,32,33] (Scheme 2).

A revolutionizing step enabling industrial scale production of PN involved the incorporation of Diels-Alder reactions into the synthetic route through condensation of 4,5-substituted-oxazoles and diverse ene-substrates in order to synthesize pyridine-based structures [34,35,36,37,38] (Scheme 3).

Building upon this strategic pathway, various modifications regarding the synthesis of PN have been developed until today [39,40,41,42], not only optimizing its preparation, but furthermore facilitating the implementation of isotopic labelling into the chemistry of vitamin B6. In that regard, carbon-13C labelling of the CH2-side chains in 4′ and 5′-positions has been reported using diethyl-di-13C-maleate ester (a) (Figure 2) or by acid catalyzed cyclisation of [1,4-13C2]-2-butenedinitrile and [1-13C,2-15N]-2-formylaminopropanenitrile [32,43,44,45]. In addition, nitrogen-15N isotopes have been integrated either inside the heterocycle or—in the case of amine derivatives—in the 4′-side chain (b) [31,46]. 13C- and 15N-labelling inside the core-structure was accomplished starting from either [15N-3-13C]-alanine and [13C]-formic acid (c) [47] or [15N-13C3]-alanine (d) [48], respectively.

Stable isotopologues of vitamins are particularly valuable as tracers in metabolic studies or as internal standards in quantitations by stable isotope dilution assays (SIDAs) [49]. In this regard, different labellings are of particular interest, when double isotope studies for differentiating between vitamers or between their function as tracer and internal standards have to be developed [50]. Although there exists a variety of synthetic strategies towards the preparation of stable isotopologues of the single vitamers, so far no preparation of [13C3]-labelled B6 vitamers starting from propionic acid has been reported. In pursuit of this purpose, the aim of this work focused on the investigation of current synthetic strategies in order to incorporate them into the preparation of isotopically labelled B6 vitamers. In order to guarantee a sufficient extent of labelling, which constitutes an important aspect regarding the application in SIDA inter alia because of the facilitated differentiation from other isotopologues, a consecutive threefold labelling within propionic acid has been chosen as starting material because of the direct incorporation into the “backbone” of PN when transformed according to the chosen reaction pathway (Scheme 4). Additionally, the commercial availability in proportion to its price played a decisive role when contrasted to other starting materials (e.g., alanine), which are frequently used in the literature.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Synthesis of 13C3-PN
As for the synthetic strategy, first, propionic acid was converted into alanine via halogenation and amination (Scheme 4). The second half of the reaction procedure comprised the conversion of the amino acid into PN through the formation of an oxazole intermediate followed by a Diels-Alder reaction.

Starting from propionic acid (4), halogenation in α-position was accomplished using thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and bromine (Br2) [51] (Scheme 4).

The in situ generated α-halogenated acyl halides were directly transformed into the respective esters with moderate to good yields (67–88%, Table 1, Scheme 5).

Variations of the reaction conditions indicated that aspects like brominating time (tBr2; 2d ~ 5.5 h > 3.5 h, Table 1, entry 1/2/3) and the scale of the reaction (PA; 5 g > 2 g > 1 g, Table 1, entry 2/4/7) had a higher impact on the reaction outcome, whereas the amount of added bromine (1.05/1.50 eq., Table 1, entry 2/3) or alcohol (Alc; 2.5–13 eq.) depicted only a minor influence. Alteration of the alcohol (R) showed that ethanol served well as esterification substrate, whereas methanol and n-butanol delivered lower yields (Table 1, entry 8/10). Using tert-butanol, no product could be isolated probably due to instability of the product under given conditions (Table 1, entry 9). Raising the temperature during the esterification step led to lower yields and increased formation of side products (Table 1, entry 6). Attempts to omit the esterification by addition of water instead of alcohol and thus to isolate the α-bromo carboxylic acid resulted also in lower yields (26%), whereas saponification of the α-halogenated esters led to the respective carboxylic acid in moderate yield (77%). Furthermore, the formation of a side product was observed independent of the reaction conditions (e.g., added bromine or reaction time). Although this substance can be separated from the product through distillation, we decided to skip this purification step and to immediately subdue the mixture to the next reaction because of potentially occurring losses of the target 6 during isolation.

The transformation of halogenated substrates into the respective amines can be carried out with various reagents like ammonia, ammonium chloride or phthalimide derivatives [31,52,53,54]. In this work, the selective amination in α-position was conducted applying the Gabriel synthesis. At first, potassium phthalimide, prepared from phthalimide and potassium hydroxide, was used to generate the N-substituted phthalimide 6 ([(M + H)+] m/z = 251.3). Subsequent attempts to cleave the phthalimide group with ethylene diamine or hydrazine hydrate—reagents which are frequently used for the mild removal of phthalimide groups [55,56,57,58,59,60,61]—led to the formation of undesired amide derivatives of the starting material irrespective of the reaction conditions. In order to circumvent this problem, we decided to cleave the phthalimide group through acid hydrolysis and remove the formed phthalic anhydride via extraction with ethyl acetate resulting in the hydrochloride salt of alanine 7 ([(M − HCl + H)+] m/z = 93.0) with an overall yield of 78% over the first five steps.

Because of the accompanying hydrolysis of the ester functionality during the removal of the phthalimide group, the next step involved the esterification with thionyl chloride and the respective alcohol resulting in the alanine butyl ester 8 ([(M − HCl + H)+] m/z = 149.0, 83%) [62].

N-formylation of amines can be accomplished according to a numerous selection of methods comprising different reagents, with one of the more often chosen being formic acid along with different additives in combination with acid or organic/metal catalysts [63,64]. A rather elegant method involves the use of triethylorthoformiate (TEO) [65,66,67]. Whereas the latter reagent is more commonly preferred, we chose the methyl derivate trimethylorthoformiate (TMO, Scheme 6) because of its lower boiling point, thus facilitating purification and resulting in the desired formylated product 9 ([(M + H)+] m/z = 177.2, 84%, Table 2, entry 16).

Main aspects affecting the outcome of the reaction besides reaction temperature and time (Table 2; entries 1–5) were also the size of the alkyl chain. Generally, higher yields could be achieved by either raising the temperature to 160 °C or maintaining the reaction time up to two hours. Choosing higher alkyl homologues increased the overall yield of the reaction almost regardless of the other parameters. This is illustrated by switching from an ethyl substituent to n-propyl and n-butyl, respectively. With the latter, reactions proceeded nearly quantitatively even at temperatures of 150 °C and reaction times of 1.5 h (Table 2; entries 6–15).

5-Alkoxy-4-methyl-oxazoles represent the key substrates of this synthetic path featuring their diene functionality. The ring closure is commonly undertaken by reaction with phosphorus pentoxide while sometimes adding oxides of alkaline earth metals [31,43,66,67,68]. Although a variety of derivatives have been investigated as substrate for Diels-Alder reactions, the reaction still remains the bottleneck of the pathway because of the rather moderate yield, mainly because of the volatility of the oxazole and its sensitivity towards hydrolysis.

In this work, we focused on the impact of the addition of alkoxides and the variation of the alkyl chain on the reaction outcome (Scheme 7). First, the effect of magnesium oxide (MgO) without the use of celite was examined. This attempt resulted in a rather unsatisfying outcome (22%, Table 3, entry 1).

Increasing the amount of MgO, dividing the addition of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) or using celite, on the one hand, did not affect the yield to a great extent (27%, Table 3, entry 2), while utilizing a higher excess of MgO, on the other hand, led to a significant increase (40%, Table 3, entry 3). Switching to tin chloride (SnCl2) or no addition of an additive (not shown) led to worse or no reaction compared to MgO (19%, Table 3, entry 4). Compared to the previous experiments, switching to calcium oxide (CaO) resulted in an improved yield right away (46–48%, Table 3, entry 5/6). Furthermore, exchanging the alkoxy-substituent by a higher homologue resulted in higher yields (48–70%, Table 3, entry 6/7/8). This is probably due to, inter alia, the resulting lower volatility of the product and, therefore, presumably lower losses during the isolation of the product. While the preparation of these oxazoles (e.g., 5-butoxy-oxazole) was reported starting from other substrates such as n-butyl α-isocyanopropionate or 1-bromo-1-n-butoxyacetone, the influence of the alkoxy chain on this specific cyclisation procedure using P2O5 has not been documented in the literature yet [38,42]. The labelled oxazole 10 was finally prepared using the optimized reaction conditions and verified via ESI-MS ([(M + H)+] m/z = 159.1, 62%, Table 3, entry 9).

Utilizing the diene structure of the oxazole, the transformation of 10 involved a Diels-Alder reaction with 2,5-dihydrofuran (2,5-DHF) in a pressure vial to obtain the bicyclic compound 11 ([(M + H)+] m/z = 155.1, 61%, Table 4, entry 4) [31]. In accordance with earlier reaction steps during this study a longer alkyl chain suggested a higher yield (57–72%, Scheme 8, Table 4, entry 1/3). Furthermore, the absence of trichloroacetic acid (CCl3COOH) resulted in a drastically lower reaction outcome (27%, Table 4, entry 2).

The subsequent ring opening by hydrolysis leading to the bromine salt of pyridoxine was performed using aqueous hydrogen bromide. Finally, the hydrochloride salt of PN (1) was obtained by reaction with silver chloride ([(M − HCl + H)+] m/z = 173.0, 82%) [21,22].

Generally, all synthesized products were verified via ESI-MS and NMR-spectroscopy. In the latter, the signals of the labelled carbon atoms in the respective 13C-NMRs showed the same shifts as unlabeled substrates, but differed with regard to the resulting multiplicities (e.g., methyl-13C splitting up into a doublet due to interaction with the nearby 13C-carbon) and overall intensity.

As mentioned in the introduction, the preparation of fourfold-isotopically labelled PN was reported in the literature in five steps with a yield of approximately 25% [48]. The major difference to our synthetic route is that we added five reaction steps dedicated to the preparation of [13C3]-labelled alanine. Therefore, we increased the total linear steps to ten, while obtaining PN in an overall yield of 17%. Hereby, Caulkins et al. chose [15N-13C3]-alanine as a starting point, whereas [13C3]-propionic acid marked ours. Both strategies intertwine in alanine being a substrate, but our proposed route holds the potential to include also a 15N-nitrogen when using 15N-ammonia labelled substrates (e.g., 15N-phtalimide) resulting in the same substrate. Here, as a further aspect, the factor of costs has to be taken into account: although both substrates being commercially available, fully labelled alanine represents a rather expensive investment, whereas the use of fully labelled propionic acid and the fact that alanine can be prepared in the first five steps in 78% yield, grants a higher return regarding the amount of finally produced substrate even if 15N-labelled substances are included into the account for additional labelling. Moreover, as both strategies make use of a Diels-Alder reaction, further isotopes could be incorporated with isotopically labelled ene-substrates.

2.2. Synthesis of [13C3]-PL and [13C3]-PM
With [13C3]-PN in hand, the path towards other vitamers of the B6 group started with the preparation of [13C3]-PL. Therefore, the primary alcohol in 4′-position was oxidized and directly transformed into the imine 13 by addition of methylamine hydrochloride ([(M + H)+] m/z = 184.0, 34%, Scheme 9).

While a diverse selection of procedures has been reported regarding the oxidation of PN, most reactions have in common the utilization of manganese dioxide (MnO2) as oxidizing reagent [69,70]. With water as solvent [31,32,33], the implementation of MnO2, either commercially available or freshly prepared colloidal one [71], resulted in mediocre yields (34%, Table 5, entry 1). Changing the solvent from water to toluene had a minor improving impact on the reaction (42%, Table 5, entry 2), while conversion of PN in toluene under removal of water through azeotropic distillation [72] resulted in the formation of various side products. Next to manganese dioxide, potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was also tested regarding the oxidation of PN [27], but did not improve the reaction outcome despite variation of the reaction conditions, e.g., variation of the amount of KMnO4 (0.4–1.6 eq.) resp. methylamine (CH3NH2) (3–10 eq.), reaction temperature (rt to 70 °C) and time or neutralization of PN hydrochloride beforehand (11–42%, Table 5, entries 3–12).

Substitution of methylamine with benzylamine or ethylene diamine in order to test other amine substrates did not provide the respective imine derivative. Efforts to prepare PL using TEMPO or IBX resulted in no transformation of the starting material at all. The obtained isolated imine was converted into [13C3]-PL (2) by acid hydrolysis ([(M + H)+] m/z = 171.0, 77%, Scheme 9).

For the preparation of [13C3]-PM, the aldehyde 2 was firstly transformed into the respective oxime 12 using hydroxylamine hydrochloride ([(M + H)+] m/z = 186.1, 52%, Scheme 10).

Reportedly, an excess addition of sodium acetate (NaAc) is necessary to ensure a positive reaction outcome (65%, Table 6, entry 1) [33,46,73]. The reduction of the amount of sodium acetate towards stoichiometric quantities resulted in no conversion of the starting material, thus confirming the results from literature (Table 6, entry 2).

Because of the presumable pH-dependence of the reaction, the next step in the optimization involved the substitution of NaAc with a sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer (pH = 4.8), which instantly led to a higher yield (71%, Table 6, entry 3). Variation of the reaction time showed that a slightly longer reaction time (2 × 20 min) improved the reaction outcome (79%), whereas further prolongation (2 × 30 min) had no further enhancing effect (78%, Table 6, entry 4/5). Moreover, a second addition of buffer appeared to be necessary for the continuance of the reaction (61%, Table 6, entry 6). Reduction of the amount of hydroxylamine hydrochloride resulted in a decrease of yield (45%, Table 6, entry 7). Finally, the [13C3]-Oxime 12 was hydrogenated using H2 and Pd/C to obtain [13C3]-PM (3, [(M + H)+] m/z = 172.1, 65%, Scheme 10).

4. Conclusions
In summary, the first synthetic route for the preparation of [13C3]-labelled vitamers of the B6 group (PN, PL, PM) starting from [13C3]-propionic acid was presented. Hereby, higher alkyl homologues showed a positive impact on the yield of various intermediates: Next to switching from TEO towards TMO, and thus facilitating the purification, increasing the alkyl chain of the alcohol resulted in nearly quantitative conversions towards the formylated alanine ester. Furthermore, we investigated the influence, on the one hand, of CaO as an additive in comparison to MgO, which represents the commonly used reagent in this type of reaction, and, on the other hand, higher alkyl residues—in this regard the first time with n-BuOH under the noted conditions—on the formation of 5-Alkoxy-4-methyl oxazoles, both factors leading to a significant increase of the reaction outcome. While utilization of hydroxylamine and sodium acetate belongs to the catalogue of common craftsmanship regarding the preparation of PN-oxime, we came across the enhancing effect on the yield using a sodium-acetate buffer instead of neat NaAc. Finally, choosing this route reduces the cost for the preparation of labelled product due to fully labelled propionic acid being a cheaper commercially available substrate than alanine, which is mostly used in the literature.
