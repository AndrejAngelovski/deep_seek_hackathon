* Visit rates are based on the July 1, 2017–July 1, 2019, estimates of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population as developed by the U.S. Census Bureau Population Division; 95% CIs are indicated by error bars.

† ED visits with diagnosed MHDs were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes F01–F99 and were categorized into the following disorder categories: psychoactive substance use disorders (F10–F19); anxiety, stress-related, or other nonpsychotic mental disorders (F40–F48); mood (affective) disorders (F30–F39); other MHD (F01–F09 or F50–F99); and schizophrenia, schizotypal, delusional, or other nonmood psychotic disorders (F20–F29). A visit could be included in more than one disorder category.

§ Based on a sample of visits by adults aged ≥18 years to EDs in noninstitutional general and short-stay hospitals located in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, excluding federal, military, and Veterans Administration hospitals.
