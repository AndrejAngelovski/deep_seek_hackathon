flow via mechanisms that may involve elevated microgliosis and pro-inflammatory
pathways. In the present study, the effects of severe cerebral hypoperfusion
were investigated on white matter function and inflammation. Male C57Bl/6J mice
underwent bilateral common carotid artery stenosis and white matter function was
assessed at seven days with electrophysiology in response to evoked compound
action potentials (CAPs) in the corpus callosum. The peak latency of CAPs and
axonal refractoriness was increased following hypoperfusion, indicating a marked
functional impairment in white matter, which was paralleled by axonal and myelin
pathology and increased density and numbers of microglia/macrophages. The
functional impairment in peak latency was significantly correlated with
increased microglia/macrophages. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF; 100 mg/kg), a drug with
anti-inflammatory properties, was found to reduce peak latency but not axonal
refractoriness. DMF had no effect on hypoperfusion-induced axonal and myelin
pathology. The density of microglia/macrophages was significantly increased in
vehicle-treated hypoperfused mice, whereas DMF-treated hypoperfused mice had
similar levels to that of sham-treated mice. The study suggests that increased
microglia/macrophages following cerebral hypoperfusion contributes to the
functional impairment in white matter that may be amenable to modulation by
DMF.

Introduction
The integrity and connectivity of the brain’s white matter are critical in regulating
efficient neuronal communication and maintaining cognitive function. The key
functional cellular elements of white matter tracts are myelinated axons, the
integrity of which is dependent on a constant supply of energy to enable accuracy
and speed of action potential conduction between different brain regions.1 Myelinated axons and oligodendrocytes in white matter are highly vulnerable
to reductions in cerebral blood flow.2–4 White matter hyperintensities,
frequently detected in MRI scans from the brains of elderly individuals and those
with dementia, are closely linked to cerebral hypoperfusion.5,6 A causal relationship has been
shown in mouse models, whereby chronic hypoperfusion leads to white matter injury as
detected using DT-MRI7 and pathological investigations which show impaired axon-glial integrity and
robust microgliosis.8,9

At a functional level, the burden of white matter hyperintensity load has been
correlated with cognitive deficits.10,11 We have demonstrated that
chronic hypoperfusion in mice initially induces a selective deficit in spatial
working memory8 that progresses to encompass deficits in spatial reference memory in the
longer term.12 Oxygen-glucose deprivation in ex vivo brain slices induces an irreversible
conduction failure of evoked compound action potential (CAP) assessed with
electrophysiology in the corpus callosum, which is accompanied by axonal pathology
and oligodendrocyte death.13

At a mechanistic level, an elevated inflammatory response is implicated in the
pathogenesis of white matter pathology following cerebral hypoperfusion. We have
reported increased numbers of microglia in white matter following mild chronic
hypoperfusion8,12,14 which is also observed in more severe models.15 In white matter, increased levels of cytokines and chemokines such as TNFα,
IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP116,17 and increased levels of oxidised proteins and DNA are
present following chronic hypoperfusion,18–20 which are both implicated in
microglial-mediated damage.9,21 Pharmacological compounds that reduce activated microglia and
pro-inflammatory pathways have beneficial effects on white matter after chronic
hypoperfusion22–24 and confer
protective effects against cognitive deficits.25 Similarly, drugs which reduce pro-inflammatory microglia in white matter can
improve CAP amplitude after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and experimental autoimmune
encephalitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis).26,27

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an anti-inflammatory drug,28 has neuroprotective effects in a number of mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases29 which are paralleled by a reduction in microgliosis.30–32 Similarly, DMF has
neuroprotective effects in intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage and focal
cerebral ischaemia33–36 where it can improve
neurological deficits and reduce microglial activation.35,36 DMF or monomethyl fumarate
(MMF; the active metabolite of DMF) treatment of microglial cultures can inhibit
lipopolysaccharide-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and switch the
molecular phenotype of microglia to an alternatively activated, neuroprotective
one.37–39 Of relevance to white matter
damage, DMF has been shown to reduce demyelination, axonal damage, and improve
survival and disease course in EAE.40–42

The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that severe hypoperfusion would cause
a functional and structural impairment of white matter and increased
neuroinflammation and that DMF would improve white matter function following
hypoperfusion by modulating neuroinflammation.

Materials and methods
Animals and surgery
Adult male C57Bl/6J mice (aged 3–4 months, group housed, obtained from Charles
River UK, 12 h light/dark cycle, free access to food and water) underwent severe
chronic cerebral hypoperfusion via bilateral common carotid artery stenosis
using microcoils under isoflurane anaesthesia. A 0.18 mm internal diameter
microcoil was applied to the left and a 0.16 mm microcoil was applied to the
right common carotid artery as previously described.15 Sham mice underwent identical surgical procedure except the microcoils
were not placed on the arteries. To assess if hypoperfusion could induce
functional deficit in the corpus callosum and to determine the pathological
correlates, CAPs were assessed in a cohort of mice using electrophysiology
(hypoperfusion n = 12, sham n = 12). To determine the effects of DMF on white
matter function and pathology, two experimental cohorts were studied. Cohort 1
underwent assessment of white matter pathology (sham vehicle n = 7; sham DMF
n = 8; hypoperfused vehicle n = 15; hypoperfused DMF n = 11). Cohort 2 underwent
electrophysiology and inflammatory-related multiplex analysis (sham vehicle
n = 10; sham DMF n = 10; hypoperfused vehicle n = 16; hypoperfused DMF n = 13).
Group size was determined using power calculations from electrophysiology data.
Mice were closely monitored following surgery and those that had a poor recovery
after surgery were culled. The initial and final cohort sizes are indicated in
supplementary Table 1.

In all cohorts, mice were coded and randomly assigned to experimental groups.
Mice were terminated seven days following surgery. The surgery was undertaken by
an experimenter who was blinded to drug treatment group. The data analysis was
conducted by researchers blinded to experimental grouping. All experiments were
conducted under the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, in
agreement with local ethical and veterinary approval (Biomedical Research
Resources, University of Edinburgh) and the ARRIVE guidelines.

Laser speckle contrast imaging
Details of laser speckle contrast imaging are presented in the supplemental
material.

Administration of DMF
DMF (Sigma, UK) was administered twice daily (8 a.m. and 5 p.m.) by oral gavage
at 100 mg/kg body weight in 0.8% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Sigma, UK)
vehicle as previously described.41 Control animals received vehicle only. Administration of DMF or vehicle
began 24 h prior to surgery and continued for seven days. Investigators
administering DMF or vehicle were blinded as to surgical intervention.

Electrophysiology
Mice were terminated by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. Brains
were rapidly dissected, placed in a cell strainer and submerged in ice-cold
oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (189 mM sucrose; 10 mM
D-glucose; 26 mM NaHCO3; 3 mM KCl; 5 mM MgCl2, 5; 0.1 mM CaCl2; 1.25 mM NaH2PO4)
for 2–3 min. Brains were then affixed to a metal vibratome plate and placed in a
bath of oxygenated ice-cold sucrose-aCSF. A single 400 µm coronal slice
approximately −1.2–−1.7 mm from bregma was cut using a vibratome (Zeiss,
Germany), and then transferred to a warmed incubation chamber (32–35℃)
containing oxygenated aCSF (10 mM D-Glucose; 26 mM NaHCO3; 5 mM KCl; 2 mM CaCl2;
124 mM NaCl; 1.25 mM NaH2PO4; 1.3 mM MgSO4). The incubation chamber was then
allowed to return to room temperature for at least 1 h prior to slice
recording.

For recording, individual slices were transferred to the slice chamber,
super-perfused with oxygenated room temperature aCSF (2–3 ml/min), secured with
a slice anchor and allowed to rest for 30 min. Recording electrodes (1–5 MΩ)
were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with aCSF, connected
to the head-stage via the Ag/AgCl wire and lowered into the corpus callosum. A
bipolar stimulating electrode was connected to the stimulus isolation unit and
lowered into the corpus callosum. Constant current square wave pulses were
delivered at 0.2 Hz for eight sweeps and the average response of the final four
sweeps used for analysis.43 The data were digitised at 200 kHz, amplified at 100× and low pass
filtered at 5 kHz then recorded on Clampex 10.3.

CAPs were evoked, whilst holding the stimulus intensity constant (100 µs
duration, 0.2 Hz), and recorded at 0.5 mm increments from 1 to 2.5 mm by moving
the recording electrode. The post-stimulus latency of the CAP peak was then
measured as a functional index of conduction velocity. For statistical
comparison between groups, the CAP was measured at a distance of 2.5 mm
apart.

Axonal health can be assessed by assaying changes in axonal excitability or
axonal ‘refractoriness’.43,44 To assess the axon refractoriness, a single control
stimulus was given followed by a paired pulse of equal intensity separated by a
variable time window decreasing from 10 to 1.5 ms in 0.5 ms increments. The
control amplitude was subtracted from the paired pulse response to leave only
the second pulse which was measured and normalised to the % of the baseline CAP.
The results were graphed versus the inter-pulse interval, and the interval that
results in a 50% reduction in CAP was used for statistical comparisons.

Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry
To determine the effects of severe hypoperfusion on white matter function and
pathology, one cohort underwent electrophysiology, and an adjacent 2 mm slice of
tissue was processed for paraffin embedding, then 8 µm sections were cut with a
microtome. All other mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and
transcardially perfused with 20 ml of 0.9% heparinized phosphate buffer saline
(PBS) and then 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.9% PBS seven days after
surgery. After perfusion, brains were removed, postfixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and
then transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS for 48 h. Brains were frozen in
isopentane at −42℃ for 2 min. Thirty micrometres coronal sections were cut using
a cryostat (Leica) and stored in cryoprotective medium (30% glycerol/30%
ethylene glycol in phosphate buffer) at −20℃ until use. Cryostat sections were
dehydrated through an increasing alcohol series, and then immersed in xylene for
10 min before being rehydrated through a decreasing alcohol series. Sections
were then equilibrated in PBS for 5 min before antigen retrieval (if required).
A 10 mM citric acid (pH 6) antigen retrieval was carried out for Iba1, MBP and
MAG staining. Sections were blocked using 10% normal serum and 0.5% BSA for 1 h
at room temperature. Primary antibodies were made up in blocking solution and
sections were incubated in primary antibody at 4℃ overnight. The following day,
the sections were incubated with secondary antibody in PBS for 2 h at room
temperature. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield HardSet mounting medium
with or without DAPI. The following primary antibodies were used in the study:
antimyelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (1:200, Abcam) as an index of
axon-glial integrity; anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) to label myelin (1:100,
Millipore); anti-ionised calcium-binding adaptor receptor molecule 1 (Iba1) to
label microglia (1:100, Menarini); antiamyloid precursor protein (APP) to label
axonal damage (1:200, Millipore); antiadenomatous polyposis coli protein CC1
(APC) to label oligodendrocyte cell bodies (1:200, Calbiochem);
antineuronal-glial antigen (NG2) to label oligodendrocyte progenitor cells
(1:100, Millipore). Alexa Fluor 488 and 555 conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:500) were purchased from Life Technologies Ltd (UK).

Image acquisition and analysis
All images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5) with either
a 20× air or a 40× oil-immersion objective, pinhole of 1 Airy unit and
1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. MBP, MAG, APP, and Iba1 immunostainings were
acquired as one single image, while CC1 and NG2 were acquired as a 5 µm stack.
Images were acquired at the corpus callosum from the right hemisphere above the
lateral ventricle at the stereotactic co-ordinates, lateral 2.40 ± 0.1 mm,
Bregma −1.5 ± 0.1 mm. Quantitative measurements were performed using imageJ
(FIJI) software. The number of Iba-1 positive cells was counted in three defined
areas, and the average was used for statistical purposes. Mean fluorescence
intensity (MBP, MAG immunostaining) or the percentage area of positive staining
(Iba1 immunostaining) or number of cells/volume (CC1/NG2 immunostaining) were
measured at the corpus callosum which was manually outlined using a free-hand
tool. The number of swollen axons (axonal bulbs) in APP immunostained sections
was counted in three defined areas along the corpus callosum and the average was
used for statistical purposes. Observers were blind to surgery procedure and
drug treatment.

Inflammatory-related protein multiplex
Brain homogenates were assayed for inflammatory-related molecules using a
Bio-plex mouse cytokine and chemokine assay (Biorad), which allows the detection
of multiple inflammatory-related molecules in the same sample. A 1.8 mm section
rostral to the brain slice used for electrophysiology was snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80℃. Tissue was weighed and homogenised in 5 × volume of
tissue lysing solution (Bioplex cell lysis kit, made according to manufacturer’s
instructions), and then sonicated for 5 s at 10% amplitude. Samples were spun at
5000 g at 4℃, and then the supernatant was collected and
stored at −80℃. Total protein concentration was determined using a Thermo
Scientific Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit and samples were diluted with bioplex
cell lysis buffer to obtain a final total protein concentration of 13 mg/ml.
Samples were then diluted to 8 mg/ml in bioplex sample buffer diluent before
they underwent the multiplex assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The levels of seven inflammatory-related molecules were measured: interleukin-6
(IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), keratinocyte
chemoattractant (KC), monocyte chemoattractant-1 (MCP-1), macrophage
inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
in duplicate with standards (sham vehicle n = 8; sham DMF n = 8, hypoperfused
vehicle n = 11; hypoperfused DMF n = 11). One animal from each of the
hypoperfusion groups and two animals from each of the sham groups were randomly
selected for omission from this experiment due to the space restrictions of the
96-well plate. Standards included in each kit were used to generate standard
curves for each analyte, and then the mean fluorescence intensity for each
analyte was calculated with five-point logistic regression using Bio-plex
workstation software (Biorad).

Statistics
Analysis and graphs were generated using Prism GraphPad 5.0 software. Data from
the electrophysiology and related pathology cohorts were normally distributed
and analysed using Student’s t test for independent samples.
Associations between electrophysiology data and microglia numbers were analysed
with Pearson’s correlation analysis. Other data, in which the effect of surgery
and drug treatment or cerebral blood flow were investigated, were analysed by
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. Data
were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean and considered statistically
significant when p-value was <0.05.

Results
Hypoperfusion induces severe reductions in cerebral blood flow
To determine if hypoperfusion induced reductions in cerebral blood flow, laser
speckle contrast imaging was used one and seven days following surgery
(supplemental Figure 1(a)). There was a significant effect of surgery
(F(1-18) = 58.2; p < 0.0001) and of time
(F(2, 36) = 51.6; p < 0.0001) in the CBF
values (% of baseline). Post hoc analysis showed that there is a significant
reduction in CBF in hypoperfused mice compared with sham-treated mice 24 h
(p < 0.001) and seven days following surgery
(p < 0.001) (supplemental Figure 1(b)). Figure 1. Deficits in white matter function in response to severe chronic

Severe hypoperfusion induces a deficit in white matter function
At the outset, the effects of severe hypoperfusion on white matter function at
seven days were assessed by electrophysiology in the corpus callosum. The peak
latency of evoked CAPs, as an index of conduction velocity, was significantly
increased in hypoperfused by 17% ± 3.6% as compared to sham mice
(p = 0.003) (Figure 1(a) and (b)). As a measure of
axonal health, axonal refractoriness of CAPs was studied in the corpus callosum.
The interpulse interval resulting in a 50% reduction in the CAP was
significantly increased in hypoperfused mice, indicative of perturbed axonal
health (p = 0.03) when compared with sham-treated animals
(Figure 1(c) and
(d)). Collectively, these data indicate that callosal white matter fibres
exhibit pronounced alterations in their electrophysiological properties in
response to severe hypoperfusion.

Increased white matter pathology and inflammation in response to severe
hypoperfusion
To determine if the deficit in white matter function was accompanied by
pathological changes to myelinated axons and an inflammatory response, the
adjacent slices to those used for electrophysiology were assessed. There was a
significant reduction in the % area of MBP staining following hypoperfusion,
indicating that hypoperfusion caused myelin pathology
(p = 0.016; Figure 2(a) and (b)). Axonal bulbs, detected with APP
immunohistochemistry, were not present in sham-treated animals but were
significantly increased in hypoperfused animals (p = 0.001;
Figure 2(c) and
(d)), thus indicating that hypoperfusion caused axonal pathology. Figure 2. White matter pathology in response to severe chronic hypoperfusion.
(a) Confocal images from the corpus callosum of animals

damage following hypoperfusion (***p = 0.001).



Iba-1-positive immunostaining was undertaken in the corpus callosum to
investigate the impact of hypoperfusion on inflammation (Figure 3(a)). There was a significant
increase in the number of Iba1-positive cells (p = 0.0003;
Figure 3(b)) and the
density of Iba1-immunostaining (p = 0.009; Figure 3(c)) following hypoperfusion. A
number of studies have indicated that pharmacological drugs which reduce
microglia in white matter can improve conduction velocity,26,27 suggesting
that increased microglia may cause white matter dysfunction. We investigated
this by correlating microglia/macrophages with peak latency or axonal
refractoriness. There was a significant positive correlation between numbers of
microglia and slowing of peak latency (r = 0.59, p = 0.002;
Figure 3(d)) and
density of Iba-1 immunostaining and slowing of peak latency (r = 0.55,
p = 0.006; Figure 3(e)), thus indicating an association between
microglia/macrophages and deficits in conduction velocity. There was no
significant association between microglial/macrophage numbers and slowing of
axonal refractory period (r = 0.4, p = 0.06; Figure 3(e)) or
microglial/macrophage density and slowing of axonal refractory period (r = 0.29,
p = 0.17; Figure 3(g)). Figure 3. Elevated microglia/macrophage number and density in response to

***p < 0.001; n = 12 per group.



DMF treatment improves white matter function following severe
hypoperfusion
To further investigate the hypothesis that microglia can cause white matter
dysfunction, a drug which is known to reduce microglial activation, DMF,36 was investigated to determine if it could protect improve white matter
function following hypoperfusion. DMF significantly reduced the peak latency in
hypoperfused mice by 7% ± 1.2% of vehicle-treated hypoperfused mice control
values (p < 0.05) (Figure 4(a) and (b)). Thus, the data
indicate a beneficial effect of DMF on conduction velocity of myelinated fibres.
Axonal refractoriness was not significantly altered by DMF treatment
(p = 0.07) (Figure 4(c) and (d)). Therefore, these
data indicate that callosal white matter fibres exhibit pronounced alterations
in conduction velocity and that DMF treatment can improve white matter function.
Figure 4. DMF treatment improved the peak latency of CAP, but not axonal
refractoriness following severe chronic hypoperfusion. (a, b)
DMF-treated hypoperfused mice had a reduced peak latency compared to
vehicle-treated mice (*p < 0.05) indicating that
DMF is able to improve conduction velocity of myelinated fibres. (c,

treatment (p = 0.07). Data are presented as
mean ± S.E.M. Student’s t test,

Hypoperfusion causes a breakdown of axon-glial integrity that is unaffected
by DMF
Following the demonstration that DMF improved white matter function in
hypoperfused mice, its impact on hypoperfusion-induced pathology to myelinated
axons was explored. MBP, a marker of myelin integrity, was not significantly
altered in response to hypoperfusion or DMF administration (Figure 5(a) and (b)). Therefore, a
further marker of myelin damage was investigated, MAG, as reductions in MAG
intensity have been demonstrated previously in response to hypoperfusion,
indicative of altered axon-glial integrity.9,14 A significant reduction in
MAG immunostaining was determined following severe hypoperfusion
(F(1-33) = 11.7; p = 0.002), but there was no
significant effect of DMF administration or interactions (Figure 4(c) and (d)). Post hoc comparison
showed a significant reduction in MAG immunostaining with hypoperfusion in both
vehicle- (p < 0.05) and DMF-treated
(p < 0.05) groups when compared with sham controls. Figure 5. Axon-glial integrity was damaged by severe hypoperfusion but

Previous studies have revealed differential vulnerabilities of mature
oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells in response to hypoperfusion.
Oligodendrocytes have been suggested to facilitate axonal conduction by
mechanisms other than myelination.45 Thus, the numbers of these cells were determined after hypoperfusion and
DMF treatment using CC1 and NG2 immunohistochemistry for mature oligodendrocytes
and OPCs, respectively (Figure
5(e)). Although there was a significant reduction in the number of
CC1-positive cells (F(1-31) = 13.0, p = 0.001) in
response to hypoperfusion, DMF treatment had no effect and there were no
significant interactions (Figure 4(f)). Post hoc comparison indicated a significant reduction
in the number of CC1 immunopositive cells following hypoperfusion in DMF-treated
mice (p < 0.05) but not in vehicle-treated mice
(p > 0.05). In contrast, there was a significant
increase in the number of NG2-positive cells (F (1-33) = 7.6,
p = 0.009); however, DMF treatment had no significant
effect on the number of NG2 cells and there were no significant interactions
(Figure 5(f)).

To build on the previous findings that axonal health was impaired by
hypoperfusion but axonal refractoriness was not modulated by DMF, axonal
pathology was investigated by APP immunostaining and assessment of the number of
APP-positive axonal bulbs (Figure 5(g)). Axonal bulbs were not detected in sham mice but were
observed in hypoperfused mice in the corpus callosum. There was a significant
increase in the number of APP-positive axonal bulbs after hypoperfusion surgery
(F(1-33) = 4.9, p = 0.04), but the number was
unaffected by DMF and there were no significant interactions (Figure 5(h)).

Thus, although hypoperfusion causes damage to myelinated axons, axon-glial
integrity and the number of mature and immature oligodendrocytes, these measures
were unaffected by DMF.

Hypoperfusion increased microglial/macrophage density which is modulated by
DMF
Previous studies have indicated that DMF may exert protective effects through
inflammatory mechanisms.32,36 Since we found a significant association between
microglia/macrophages and deficits in white matter function, we next determined
if microglial/macrophages would be affected by DMF treatment (Figure 6(a)).
Microglial/macrophage density was significantly increased following
hypoperfusion (F(1-33) = 7.93, p = 0.008), but there
was no effect of drug treatment (Figure 6(b)). Notably, post hoc analysis
showed that there was a significant increase in Iba1 staining in hypoperfused
vehicle-treated mice compared with sham vehicle-treated mice
(p < 0.05), but there was no difference between sham and
hypoperfused mice treated with DMF (p > 0.05), suggesting
that DMF modestly reduced the density of microglia/macrophages. Figure 6. The effect of DMF on the microglial response. (a) Confocal images

Hypoperfusion and DMF treatment effects on cytokines, chemokines and growth
factors
The modest reduction in the microglial/macrophage response to hypoperfusion with
DMF treatment suggested that DMF may act by modulating levels of
inflammatory-related proteins. To further explore neuroinflammatory mechanisms,
a range of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were examined using a
multiplex immunoassay.

The levels of chemoattractant and growth factor molecules MIP-1α, MCP-1, KC and
VEGF were examined firstly (Figure 7). All four molecules were significantly increased after
hypoperfusion (MIP-1α F(1-34) = 13.7, p = 0.0008;
MCP-1 F(1-34) = 18.2, p = 0.0001; KC
F(1-33) = 14.3, p = 0.0006; VEGF
F(1-34) = 34.8, p < 0.0001), and there was no
significant effect of DMF administration or significant interactions. Post hoc
comparison showed a significant increase in the levels of MCP-1, KC and VEGF in
hypoperfused vehicle-treated mice compared with sham vehicle-treated mice and in
DMF hypoperfused compared to DMF sham-treated mice. In contrast, although MIP-1α
levels were significantly increased (p < 0.01) in
hypoperfused vehicle-treated mice compared with sham vehicle-treated mice,
MIP-1α levels in DMF-treated hypoperfused mice were not significantly different
compared with sham DMF-treated mice (p > 0.05) suggesting
that DMF reduced levels of MIP-1 α (Figure 7(a)). Figure 7. The effect of DMF on chemokines, growth factors and cytokines. Levels
of inflammatory-related proteins were calculated (pg/ml) using a
multiplex assay. (a) There was a highly significant effect of
surgery (F (1-34) = 13.7; ***p = 0.0008)
in the concentration of MIP-1α (pg/ml). Post hoc analysis showed
that there was a significant increase in MIP-1α levels in
hypoperfused vehicle-treated animals compared with sham
vehicle-treated animals (##p < 0.01); however,
notably there was no significant increase in MIP-1a levels in the

mice (p > 0.05). (b) There was a highly
significant effect of surgery (F (1-34) = 18.2;

compared with sham vehicle-treated animals
(##p < 0.01) and a significant increase in MCP-1
levels in hypoperfused DMF-treated animals compared with sham
DMF-treated animals, but by a lesser magnitude
(#p < 0.05). (c) There was a significant effect
of surgery (F (1-33) = 14.3;

Post hoc analysis showed that there was a significant elevation in

treatment (#p < 0.05), and in hypoperfused
DMF-treated mice when compared with sham DMF-treated mice
(#p < 0.05). (d) There was a highly
significant effect of surgery (F (1-34) = 34.8;

(pg/ml). Post hoc analysis showed that there was a significant
increase in VEGF levels in hypoperfused vehicle-treated animals
compared with sham vehicle-treated animals
(##p < 0.01). Notably, there was also a
significant increase in VEGF levels in the DMF-treated hypoperfused
mice compared with the DMF-treated sham mice, by a greater magnitude
(###p < 0.001) than the increase seen in
vehicle treated mice. (e) For IL-6 levels, there was a significant
effect of surgery (F (1-34) = 4.4,
*p = 0.04). (f and g) There was no significant
effect of hypoperfusion or DMF for IL-1β (f) or for IFN-γ (g). Data
are presented as mean ± SEM, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
post hoc test, sham vehicle n = 8; sham DMF n = 8; hypoperfusion
vehicle n = 11; hypoperfusion DMF n = 11.



Three cytokines were examined, IL-6, IL-1β and IFN-γ (Figure 7). IL-6 levels were significantly
increased after hypoperfusion (F(1-34) = 4.4,
p = 0.04) but unaffected by DMF treatment, and there were no
significant interactions (Figure 7(e)). IL-1 β and IFN-γ were unaffected by hypoperfusion
surgery or DMF treatment (Figure 7(f) and (g)).

Therefore, overall analyses indicated hypoperfusion had a prominent effect on
inflammatory-related molecules which was unaffected by DMF treatment except for
MIP 1α levels which were dampened by DMF treatment.

Discussion
The present study demonstrated that severe hypoperfusion induces a deficit in white
matter function in the corpus callosum which is correlated with a marked increase in
microglia/macrophages. Treatment with an anti-inflammatory drug, DMF, improved white
matter function and dampened microglial/macrophage density induced by severe
hypoperfusion.

White matter function assessed with electrophysiology was markedly impaired in the
corpus callosum, key tracts connecting cerebral hemispheres and vulnerable to damage
following chronic hypoperfusion.8,15 The assessment of evoked CAPs
has been used in a number of other studies to demonstrate that perturbations in
white matter can impact their function. For example, deficits in white matter
function have been detected by measuring CAP in response to oxygen glucose
deprivation,46–48 TBI49 and excitotoxicity.50 This approach is very sensitive to the electrophysiological properties of
white matter and can be used to detect altered function caused by subtle alterations
of white matter such as differing effect of sex hormone on recovery from cuprizone
demyelination51,52 and glutathione depletion.53

The deficits in white matter function induced by hypoperfusion included a slowing of
peak latency of CAP, indicative of slowed conduction velocity. Conduction velocity
is the rate at which a nerve impulse is propagated, and is dependent on normal
myelination. Similar slowing of conduction velocity has been demonstrated following
low-level blast trauma,54 demyelination44 and neonatal hyperoxia.55 We also demonstrated that severe hypoperfusion increased the axonal
refractory period, indicative of perturbed axonal health. Increased refractory
period has been reported after hypoxia in spinal cord; however, this could be
recovered following re-oxygenation, suggesting that hypoxia may be a key mechanism
of increased refractoriness following hypoperfusion.56 Demyelination of axons induced by cuprizone or TBI and compression injury
also cause increases in refractoriness.44,49,57,58

Severe hypoperfusion resulted in white matter pathology, including myelin and axonal
damage detected with MBP and APP immunohistochemistry that may account for the
deficits in white matter function. This is an agreement with other studies where
structural alterations in white matter are reported to underlie functional
alterations. For example, demyelination or myelin thinning and axonal damage,
detected with electron microscopy or APP immunohistochemistry, are present in white
matter following cuprizone demyelination, TBI or excitotoxicity which resulted in
reduced CAP amplitude, conduction velocity and increased refractoriness.43,44,49,50,57

We found a significant elevation in microglia/macrophages in the corpus callosum
following severe hypoperfusion. Microglial activation is a robust response to
reduced cerebral blood flow following chronic hypoperfusion8,14 and in stroke
models.59,60 Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between
microglia/macrophages and slowing of peak latency, suggesting that the elevated
inflammatory environment in myelinated axon tracts may contribute to the functional
deficit. Increased microglial levels are also reported in white matter that exhibit
deficits in conduction velocity or refractoriness following cuprizone demyelination,44 EAE61 or TBI.58 The extent of axonal damage in demyelinating MS lesions is associated with
increased numbers of activated microglia/macrophages62 which have been hypothesised to play a mechanistic role in white matter
damage through the release of inflammatory-related mediators such as nitric oxide,
which can induce reversible conduction block and axonal degeneration in demyelinated axons.63

To further test the hypothesis that microglia may mediate the deficits in white
matter function, we used a drug, DMF, which is known to reduce microgliosis in a
number of disease models including focal cerebral ischaemia.36,64 DMF was found
to significantly improve peak latency following severe hypoperfusion. This
corroborates with other studies which have shown that DMF can exert protective
effects on motor and neurological function in focal cerebral ischaemia,36,64 intracerebral haemorrhage35 and other models of neurodegeneration.29,31,32,41,65 DMF is also known to protect
against cognitive deficits assessed in the Morris water maze in a mouse model of
subarachnoid haemorrhage.34 MMF (derivative of DMF) protects against functional deficits assessed with
electrophysiology in retinal ischaemia-reperfusion66 and in an experimental autoimmune neuritis model.65

Although DMF exerted protective effects on white matter function in the corpus
callosum, this was not paralleled by protective effects on white matter structure.
In a first cohort, reduced MBP immunostaining was determined in mice that exhibited
functional deficits following hypoperfusion, confirming the findings of Miki et al.15 in severe hypoperfusion. However, in a second cohort, a similar reduction in
MBP staining was not found. The reasons for these differences between cohorts are
not clear. One explanation may be that the tissue was processed differently using
sucrose treatment and cryostat sectioning as opposed to paraffin embedding. To
further examine myelin integrity after hypoperfusion, we therefore used another
marker, MAG which we previously demonstrated to be sensitive to chronic
hypoperfusion.9,14 However, despite the reductions in MAG immunostaining in
response to severe hypoperfusion, MAG pathology was not attenuated with DMF.
Oligodendrocytes contain a number of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors
which monitor neuronal activity and facilitate axonal conduction by mechanisms other
than myelination.45 Therefore, in light of the fact that DMF did not modulate MAG pathology, we
examined the effects of DMF on mature and immature oligodendrocyte populations. We
demonstrated that mature oligodendrocytes are particularly vulnerable to
hypoperfusion with levels markedly reduced seven days following hypoperfusion. This
finding is in agreement with our previous study14 and that of others18 indicating CC1 levels are reduced within days following chronic hypoperfusion
and focal cerebral ischemia.67,68 In contrast, the levels of NG2 oligodendrocyte cells were
increased in response to severe hypoperfusion, as others69 have reported following focal cerebral ischaemia. However, there was no
protective effect of DMF administration on oligodendrocyte numbers after
hypoperfusion. Similarly, DMF has no protective effects on mature and
oligodendrocyte precursor cells following cuprizone demyelination.70

Collectively, the data indicate that DMF can improve white matter function following
hypoperfusion, but this is not associated with a concomitant protective effect on
axonal-glial integrity. A multitude of factors contribute to conduction velocity
along myelinated fibres which also include the distribution and density of ion
channels at nodal regions. Other studies have showed that deficits in conduction
velocity and axonal refractoriness are sustained in the recovery from neonatal
hyperoxia or withdrawal from cuprizone diet,44,55 despite a recovery of
axon-glial integrity. Instead, they found sustained, subtle alterations in the
structural composition of the paranode and Node of Ranvier including increased
spread of Nav1.6 channels along the Node of Ranvier, which we have also reported
after mild chronic hypoperfusion.9 Clofazimine, a drug which prevents loss of potassium channels, can improve
conduction velocity and axonal refractoriness following TBI.58 Therefore, the limited exploration of axon-glial integrity that we have
carried out may not be the most sensitive pathological indices of functional
deficits, and instead specific regions of node and paranodal domains of myelinated
axons and ion channels may be vulnerable.

An important consideration of the present study is whether the dose of DMF was
appropriate to ensure maximal protective effects in white matter. Protective effects
of DMF have been reported at doses as low as 15 mg/kg in intracerebral/subarachnoid
haemorrhage and EAE33,34,40 and 30 mg/kg in a model of Huntington’s disease.29 More recently, Schulze-Topoff et al.42 used the same dose as the present study (100 mg/kg) to demonstrate clinical
and histological protection following EAE. DMF is thought to act mechanistically by
enhancing the activity of Nrf2 signalling, an endogenous survival pathway with
anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that
activates a battery of cytoprotective genes such as genes encoding heme-oxygenase-1
(hmox1), osgin 1 (osgin 1) and NAD(P)H
dehydrogenase quinone 1 (nqo1). Brennan et al.71 recently carried out an investigation of the dose–response effect of DMF on
Nrf2-dependent gene changes. For many genes studied, such as hmox1,
there were no notable increases in the brain following 100 mg/kg of DMF; however,
400 and 600 mg/kg could induce increases in hmox1 expression, an
effect reported by others.32 Therefore, it may be possible that the modest protective effects that DMF
(100 mg/kg) had on white matter function in the present study could be enhanced with
a higher dosage.

In contrast to the protective effects of DMF on peak latency, we found no parallel
protective effects on axonal refractoriness, as an index of axonal health.
Similarly, we found a significant increase in APP immunostaining, indicative of
axonal damage, following severe chronic hypoperfusion that was not attenuated with
DMF treatment. Similar results were reported on white matter function following
administration of the immunophilin ligand FK506 after TBI. FK506 treatment could
protect against deficits in CAP amplitude, but did not reduce refractory changes in
myelinated fibres.72 DMF has been reported to protect against axonal damage detected with APP
immunohistochemistry in EAE41 and EAN;73 however, this may reflect a different disease mechanism.

Although we did not detect protective effects of DMF on hypoperfused-induced damage
to myelinated axons, we found that DMF led to modest reductions in the extent of
microglial/macrophage density. There is a marked reduction in microglial levels
in vivo following DMF treatment in a mouse model of synucleinopathy32 and Parkinson’s disease.31 Of relevance to the current study, DMF was found to significantly reduce
microglial levels following focal cerebral ischaemia,36 an effect that was paralleled by reduced cytokine levels.64 In support of our hypothesis that reductions in microglia/macrophages can
improve white matter function, HDAC inhibition or the sodium channel blocker
safinamide reduced pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages and improved CAP amplitude
in the corpus callous following TBI or EAE.26,27 One limitation of the current
study is that the Iba-1 immunostaining cannot discriminate between macrophages and
brain-derived microglia; therefore, some of the immunostaining may represent
infiltration of peripheral-derived macrophages. Indeed, transient blood–brain
barrier disruption has been reported in white matter in a rat model of chronic
cerebral hypoperfusion74 and may contribute to the functional deficit in the present study. In support
of this, it has been reported that DMF can protect the blood–brain barrier following
focal cerebral ischaemia in the mouse75 via decreased matrix metalloproteinase activity and protection of
interendothelial tight junctions, resulting in reduced brain oedema. This raises the
possibility that the beneficial effects of DMF on white matter function that we have
reported may have been partly mediated through protection of the blood–brain
barrier, particularly given the modest effects of DMF on inflammation that we
found.

DMF has been shown to inhibit microglial inflammation in vitro and to suppress the
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.76 Therefore, to further investigate the modulation of inflammatory-related
proteins after severe hypoperfusion and DMF treatment, a panel of molecules were
investigated with multiplex. The chemoattractant molecules MIP-1α (CCL3) and MCP-1
(CCL2) are both upregulated in the present study, and are also upregulated in
response to focal cerebral ischaemia and chronic hypoperfusion.77–79 These chemokines regulate the
infiltration of monocytes/macrophages into the CNS under pathological conditions and
are associated with exacerbating neuronal damage,80 whereas their inhibition protects neurons.81 We have reported that MIP-1α levels are modestly dampened following DMF
administration, and this may contribute to the protective effect of DMF on white
matter function, possibly via effects on monocyte/macrophage infiltration from the
periphery. Lin et al.64 reported that DMF reduced the number of MPO + neutrophils and CD3 + T cells
which infiltrated the penumbral region following focal cerebral ischaemia.

Levels of the growth factor VEGF were increased in response to severe chronic
hypoperfusion. VEGF is associated with protective effects following focal cerebral
ischaemia and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, including neuroprotection, increased
angiogenesis and cerebral blood flow.82,83 Of interest, Wiesner et al.84 showed that VEGF levels are elevated in astrocyte cultures treated with DMF,
mediated by Nrf2 signalling.

Of the three cytokines that were assessed in the current study, only IL-6 was found
to be significantly increased seven days following chronic hypoperfusion. IL-6 is
reported to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects;85 however, in the context of cerebral hypoperfusion, it confers neuroprotective effects.86 However, we did not find evidence that DMF altered IL-6 levels. In contrast
to the increase in IL-6 we have reported, the cytokines IL-1β and IFN-γ were not
altered in response to chronic hypoperfusion or DMF treatment. IL-1β is increased
after focal cerebral ischaemia87 and promotes neuronal damage. Although we did not detect any alterations in
IL-1β, others have reported that levels of IL-1β appear to alter transiently at
different time points in response to differing extents of cerebral
hypoperfusion.16,88 We also reported no alterations in IFN-γ levels, which concurs
with a findings in focal cerebral ischaemia.89 Collectively, there was minimal evidence that DMF could modulate cytokine
levels, whereas modest effects were seen on MIP-1α.

Given the modest protective effects of DMF that we have reported seven days following
severe hypoperfusion, it would be interesting to study longer term time points. Miki et al.15 showed that severe hypoperfusion causes progressive white matter pathology
and we have previously reported that more modest decreases in cerebral blood flow
cause increased microgliosis and altered axon-glial integrity at one
month,8,9 that progresses
to include microinfarcts, haemorrhage and blood–brain barrier alterations. DMF is
reported to reduce ischaemic neuronal death, oedema and blood–brain barrier
breakdown36,64,75 in the acute response to focal cerebral ischaemia thus may have
protective effects in the chronic response to modest blood flow reduction. DMF is
reported to have protective effects following long-term administration in
EAE,40,41 Parkinson’s disease,32 and following one year of administration in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease.29

To conclude, we have demonstrated that severe hypoperfusion caused deficits in white
matter function and that DMF improved white matter function following severe
hypoperfusion. Although there was no effect of DMF on the structural integrity of
damaged myelinated axons, DMF had modest effects on microglia/macrophages.
