Introduction

Although there is convincing evidence for socio-cognitive impairments in schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD), little evidence is found for deficient moral cognition. We investigated whether patients with SSD showed altered moral judgments in a story task where the protagonist either had a neutral or malicious intention towards another person. This paradigm examined whether SSD relates to altered moral cognition in general or specifically to impaired integration of prior information (such as beliefs) in moral judgments.

Methods

23 patients and 32 healthy controls read vignettes created in a 2 x 2 design. The protagonist in each story either had a neutral or negative intention towards another person which, as a result, either died (negative outcome) or did not die (neutral outcome). Participants rated the moral permissibility of the protagonist’s action. Standard null hypothesis significance testing and equivalent Bayes analyses are reported.

Results

Schizophrenia patients did not differ significantly in permissibility ratings from healthy controls. This finding was supported by the Bayes analyses which favoured the null hypothesis. Task performance was not related to symptom severity or medication.

Conclusions

The current findings do not support the notion that moral judgments are deficient in schizophrenia. Furthermore, the current study shows that patients do not have observable difficulties in integrating the protagonist’s belief in the rating of the moral permissibility of the action-outcome.

1.Introduction

Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) are characterized by altered social cognition [1,2], which plays a fundamental role in everyday functional outcome [3,4]. A prominent factor of such socio-cognitive functions is Theory of Mind (ToM), which is the ability to recognize the intentions and beliefs of others and to predict their behavior based on an understanding of their minds [5]. While there is broad agreement in behavioral and neuroimaging research that ToM processes are impaired in schizophrenia [6,7], there is one related aspect that has received relatively little attention and which yields mixed findings, namely moral cognition. Moral cognition describes the thinking about (culture-specific) sets of values and behavior that guide socially accepted manners. It is reflected in research on for example harm and pro- or anti-social behavior [8,9]. On the neuronal level, moral cognition is related to activation in regions that are involved in ToM processes such as TPJ, PFC and precuneus, but also the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala [10,11].

Due to their impairments in ToM and empathy, a common assumption is that patients with SSD make more utilitarian choices [12] in moral dilemma tasks. Making utilitarian choices means that one chooses the action that will result in the greatest good for the most, thereby justifying the means (e.g., killing one person to save a group; [13,14]). This idea is supported by the finding that SSD patients show alterations in the prefrontal cortex [7], which is related to moral goal pursuit [15] and that damage in this area is linked to stronger utilitarian thinking [16]. Behavioral studies reveal mixed results, showing fragile effects that often depend on question probe and perspective [14,17–19]. Furthermore, common tasks such as Kohlberg’s Moral Judgment Interview require verbal abilities ([20–22]) and abstract reasoning, both of which are impaired in SSD [20–22]. In general, psychiatric research on moral cognition is not yet conclusive. First, the number of available studies is small, thus more research is needed to allow for conclusive meta-analyses. Second, the comparability of published studies is limited since not all experiments examine the same dimension of morality, which is assumed to consist of a) the moral decision itself, b) the moral judgment about how appropriate the action is and c) the moral inference describing how a person is perceived based on his/her action and additional information about the person [23]. Studies on SSD revealed evidence for impaired [13,14,17,22] as well as intact moral decision-making [13,17–19]). There is some evidence for impaired moral judgment in SSD [14,24,25], however, a more recent examination merely found prolonged but otherwise intact moral judgments in patients [14]. Concerning moral inference, there are several studies on healthy controls showing that information about the acting person alters moral permissibility ratings [26–28] and that this process is related to activation in ToM areas [28]. To our knowledge, there is no study on moral inference in SSD available yet. However, prior information about the other person’s intention or reliability [29,30] plays a critical role in real-life moral judgment. To illustrate, intentionally killing someone by knowingly putting poisonous granules in the other person’s coffee versus unintentionally killing someone by putting granules in their coffee (believing it is sugar) are two morally distinct actions, although the physical action and the outcome remain the same in both scenarios (example taken from [29]).

In the current study, we examine how information about the intention of the actor influences how permissibly the action is perceived by healthy participants and patients with SSD. Although we do not directly assess how the actor itself is perceived, an examination of the relationship between prior information about the acting person and moral judgment will provide first insights into the interplay of these two factors.

Since patients with SSD often show deficient mentalizing abilities, we assume that they should reveal problems with integrating the protagonist’s belief into their moral judgments (details below). Evidence for this assumption comes from patients with autism as well as patients with frontotemporal dementia and frontal stroke, who overly rely on action-outcome (utilitarian approach), thus judging accidental harms as less permissible and attempted but failed harms as more permissible [29,31].

Healthy controls and patients with SSD rate the moral permissibility of scenarios that are designed in a 2x2 way: The protagonist in each story can either hold a negative (intention to kill someone) or a neutral belief (no murderous intentions) about his action which then leads to a negative (the other person dies) or neutral outcome (the other person does not die).

If our SSD sample has difficulties understanding the intention and belief of the protagonist, we should find that patients mostly rely their ratings on the action outcome since the intention of the protagonist (to harm or not to harm the other person) is not informative to them.

This should lead to pronounced group differences especially in conditions where the protagonist’s intention is in conflict with the situation outcome (e.g. Accidental Harm Condition: The protagonist unintentionally kills the other person. Attempted Harm Condition: The protagonist aims to kill the other person but does not succeed).

Given that the utilitarian approach holds true for patients with SSD, we expect them to show stricter ratings in the Accidental Harm condition and more tolerant ratings in the Attempted Harm condition.

However, as mentioned above, moral judgment tasks show mixed results concerning moral impairments in schizophrenia, therefore raising the possibility that patients with SSD might not reveal alterations at all. If this is the case, we will nonetheless provide post-hoc t-tests for each condition, since the critical alterations might be reflected in group differences in single conditions only [29]. Furthermore, we will also include Bayes analyses to tackle the actual support for the null over the alternative hypothesis.

2. Methods

Written informed consent was provided by each participant (see below). The study was approved by the local ethics committee Ethikkomission Salzburg, Austria (415-E/981/2-2008).

2.1 Participants

Participants in the patient group were 23 male adults, who had received a formal ICD-10 diagnosis (which was verified before study participation by certified psychiatrists using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview [32] in combination with the ICD-10 Diagnostic Checklist for Schizophrenia [33]) in the schizophrenia spectrum group (F20) or the schizoaffective disorders spectrum group (F25). Exclusion criteria for both patients and healthy controls were psychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, current or past neurological insults like head trauma, and current substance abuse. Controls were screened for mental and physical health and were excluded if met the criteria for psychiatric disorders or exhibited a family history of psychiatric illness. All patients were recruited from the outpatient and inpatient units of the Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Christian-Doppler Medical Centre, PMU, Salzburg, Austria. All patients received antipsychotic medication. Patients were clinically stable with relatively mild symptoms at the time of assessment (PANSS [34]). Healthy control participants were 32 male adults. Efforts were made to recruit a healthy male control group that matched the SSD group in demographics and education. Thus, advertisements for HCs specified that we were particularly interested in participants who finished high school, but that did not necessarily attend or complete college. Subjects were remunerated for participation and all participants provided written informed consent. Only participants who were authorized to give informed consent themselves (>18 years, not under external custody) were included in the study. Furthermore, patient recruitment was exclusively done by an experienced team of psychiatrists. Demographic data and clinical rating are listed in Table 1.

2.2 Socio-cognitive tasks

Moral judgment was examined using a translated (German) paper-pencil version of the moral judgment task [29]. Participants read 24 short vignettes in a 2 x 2 design (intention, outcome). To give an example: Grace and her friend are visiting a chemical plant. Grace gets them coffee and puts a white substance (presumably sugar) into her friend’s coffee. The storyline is varied in terms of Grace’s intention and the outcome of her action: She can either hold a neutral intention (putting the white substance into her friend’s coffee assuming it is sugar) or a negative intention (putting the white substance into the coffee knowing it is poison). Subsequently, her friend either dies (negative outcome) or does not die (neutral outcome). This results in four conditions:

Accidental Harm (neutral intention, negative outcome): Grace accidentally puts poison into the coffee believing it is sugar. Her friend dies.

Neutral Acts (neutral intention, neutral outcome): Grace puts sugar into the coffee, believing it is sugar. Her friend does not die.

Attempted Harm (negative intention, neutral outcome): Grace puts sugar into the coffee, but she believes it is poison. Her friend does not die.

Intended Harm (negative intention, negative outcome): Grace knowingly puts poison into the coffee. Her friend dies.

Two full example stories are provided in the supplementary material. Participants rate the moral permissibility (seven-point Likert scale; 1 = completely morally forbidden, 7 = completely morally permissible) of the action. Note that each participant only receives one version of each of the 24 stories. This test exists in four parallel variants which were assigned randomly to our participants and which are described and evaluated in Moran et al (2011).

Since levels of empathy are supposed to relate to utilitarian moral decision-making [35], we examined overall empathy using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) [36] in order to examine the role of empathy during moral judgments in SSD.

2.3 Basic cognition

Basal cognitive abilities were estimated using the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) and the multiple-choice vocabulary test (MWT = Mehrfachwahl‐Wortschatz‐Test).

2.4 NHST analyses

A repeated measures ANOVA including the factors Intention (neutral x negative), Outcome (neutral x negative) and Group (SSD x healthy controls) was conducted. Post-hoc t-tests were performed examining group differences for each condition separately. Additionally, Monte-Carlo-Simulation tests were done to examine the replicability of the t-test results. All (but the permutation test) analyses were implemented in JASP (JASP Team, 2018; [37,38]). Monte-Carlo Simulations were conducted using SPSS’s exact package. Details are described in the Supplementary Material.

2.5 Bayesian analyses

For Bayesian hypothesis testing [39,40] we relied on Bayes Factors (BF). BF reflects the change from prior to posterior odds for specific hypotheses and models given the data. In other words, the BF is the probability of obtaining the data under the alternative hypothesis relative to the probability of obtaining the data under the null hypothesis. In this way, the BF reflects the strength of the evidence for one hypothesis/model compared to another and can also be used to quantify the evidence for the null hypothesis compared to the alternative in light of the data. For example, in Bayesian ANOVAs BFs can reflect the strength of evidence for inclusion compared to the exclusion of different factors and effects from the model [41].

Note: Descriptives: Mean values of 32 healthy controls and 23 patients are listed.

Standard deviation of each variable is reported in brackets. ANOVA: computed using the factors intention (neutral, negative), outcome and group (SSD, controls). Asterisks indicate interactions.

Pearson Correlations indicate that symptom severity (PANSS) and medication (Chlorpromazine equivalent) were not related to task performance (rs < .38, ps > .09). Illness duration was moderately related to permissibility ratings in Intended Harm scenarios (r = .41, p = .052).

3.1 NHST analyses

3.1.1 Moral judgment task

Negative Intentions and negative Outcomes were rated as significantly less permissible compared to neutral intentions and neutral outcomes, respectively (Fs(1,53) > 94, ps < .001). These main effects for Intention and Outcome were qualified by an Outcome-by-Intention interaction (F(1,53) = 24.14, p < .001) since accidental harms were rated as more permissible than intended harms. No main effect of Group (F(1,53) = .03, p = .855) and no interaction with the factor Group were observed (Fs(1,53) < .08, ps > .37). Post-hoc t-tests reveal no significant differences between patients and controls in neither condition (Table 1). The findings of the post hoc t-test are supported by our permutation tests, which do not reveal significant group differences in any condition, and which are listed in detail in S1 File. Accordingly, the data do not show evidence for group differences in moral permissibility ratings between healthy controls and SSD patients.

3.1.2 Additional questionnaires

Patients with SSD showed significantly decreased performance on the EQ compared to healthy controls ((t = 2.6, p = .012). Furthermore, patients scored significantly lower on the SCIP (t = 4.17, p < .001) but showed normal performance on the MWT (t = 1.34, p = .185).

3.2 Bayesian analyses

Although our analyses demonstrate a lack of group differences between healthy and SSD participants, this type of analysis does not allow us to examine the extent to which the null hypothesis outperforms the alternative hypothesis (as would be suggested by non-significant group effects). The Bayesian analyses provided in this section offer a promising approach to quantify the support for the null hypothesis [40,42–45].

3.2.1 Moral judgment task

A Bayesian Repeated Measures ANOVA with default prior scales including the factors Intention (neutral x negative), Outcome (neutral x negative) and Group (SSD x healthy controls) was conducted (Table 3). The model that received the most support compared to the null model is the two main effects and interaction model Intention + Outcome + Intention*Outcome (BF10 = 2858e+74). Adding the factor Group would decrease the model support by a factor of 4.5 (2858e74/6327e73), which therefore speaks in favour of the two main effects and interaction model. Overall, there is merely anecdotal support for any model including the factor Group or any interaction with Group (BFs10 < .21). Since our primary analysis features several candidate models, we examined the change from prior to posterior model plausibility. As evident from Table 4, averaged across all models, our data strongly support the inclusion of the factors Intention (BFincl = 8465e13), Outcome (BFincl = 8465e13) and Intention*Outcome (BFincl = 59.44). Again, weak support is found for models including the factor Group (BFincl < .11).

3.2.2 Additional questionnaires

Bayesian Independent Samples t-tests reveal very strong evidence for the assumption that there is a difference in performance on the SCIP between controls and patients (BF10 = 137.03). Moderate evidence for a group difference is found for the EQ (BF10 = 6.54), and no (or anecdotal at best) support is evident for differences in the MWT (BF10 = 0.61). Order-restricted (controls > patients; comparable to one-sided t-testing in NHST) t-tests reveal similar findings, elevating the evidence for a group difference in the EQ to moderate-strong (BFs10: SCIP = 273.99; EQ = 13; MWT = 1.09). In sum, Bayes analyses suggest a decreased performance of patients on the SCIP and, slightly less pronounced, on the EQ. No substantial group differences are evident for the MWT.

4. Discussion

We examined the performance of patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) on a recent moral judgment task [29] which requires the understanding of others’ intentions in order to adequately rate the moral permissibility of actions. We argued in the Introduction that sophisticated moral judgments about other people’s behavior requires the integration of their beliefs and intentions. Patients with SSD often show impairments in belief understanding, why we assumed that this task (compared to previous moral judgment tasks which did not require belief integration) might indicate moral judgment abnormalities more robustly. Response patterns of the healthy control participants replicate previous findings showing that scenarios with neutral intentions and neutral outcomes are judged as more morally permissible than negative outcomes and intentions. Accidental harms were rated more permissible than intended but failed harms, which is again in line with previous findings on that task [29].

Interestingly, neither the standard ANOVA nor the Bayesian approach show support for altered moral judgments in patients with SSD but reveal evidence for healthy-like considerations of intentions and outcome despite observable impairments in general cognition and empathy. In the following, we discuss several reasons which might account for our findings and discuss their explanatory potential given the data and the current literature.

Probably the most important consideration for a null effect is the statistical power of the study. Whereas posterior power calculations are under heavy critique [46–48], an a priori power calculation might have been useful to estimate the necessary number of participants to detect a true effect. However, a priori power calculations require an estimation of the population effect size. Critically, this specific task is not implemented in SSD yet (and the required Cohens’ f does not generalize across task designs) and estimating the effect size in SSD based on the effect size for another psychiatric population (the original study is based on autistic patients) appears arbitrary and is beside the point. Furthermore, the effects of interest would have been reflected in interactions and estimating an ANOVA design in standard power tools can be tricky (but see [49]): Assuming that SSD patients have difficulties merging the actor’s intention with the situation outcome, they should have rated accidental harms as less permissible (or attempted harms as more permissible) compared to healthy controls, which both would have been reflected in a group-by-intention interaction. To nonetheless map the evidential strength of our results given the number of participants, we ran Bayes sequential robustness analyses which estimate the number of participants after which the Bayes factors become constant due to a convergence of updated prior distributions to posterior distributions (for details see [41]. In other words, this analysis shows upon which number of participants the group differences most likely will remain constant. As evident from S1–S4 Figs in the supplementary material, we reach a constant level of anecdotal (Intentional Harm) and moderate (Attempted Harm, Neutral Acts, Accidental Harm) support for the null hypothesis in all four conditions after 40–50 participants in total. Since the overall number of datasets is 55, we do not assume that there would have been relevant shifts in the overall pattern of results if more datasets were acquired.

Another reason for the absence of group differences might be that all patients have a comparably mild form of SSD or that our sample is biased towards patients with a relatively short illness duration. A quick descriptive approach of the medical history of our patients shows that about 35% of our patients have an illness duration of more than 4 years, 17% between two and three years and 46% are diagnosed for one year. Although most of our patients report personal changes ~2 years before their first hospitalization, this distribution suggests a high number of first-episode patients in our sample. Illness severity (as measured with the PANNS) shows a mean percentile rank of 29 for positive symptoms and a mean rank of 25 for negative symptoms. Although our sample scores at the putatively lower range of psychiatric symptoms, they are in the average range of the norm (schizophrenic) sample. A similar picture emerges for SPQ and PNS-Q values, where our sample scores at the lower range of comparable psychiatric samples ([50,51]. Assuming that there exists a true alteration in moral judgments in SSD, the current data might be explained by either a task insensitivity to detect subtle changes or that alterations in moral judgment become evident only later in the course of illness or merely occur in more severe forms of SSD. However, neither symptom severity (rs(26) < .127, ps > .521) nor illness duration (rs(26) < .336, ps > .100) were related to task performance in our sample and currently available studies on moral judgment in SSD suggest a rather subtle dysfunction even in more severe forms of SSD [21,52].

As shortly mentioned above, an alternative explanation might be that the task is not suitable to detect small alterations in moral judgments in SSD as compared to other clinical samples. In the original study[29], patients with ASD neglect the neutral intention of the actor in the accidental harm condition and rate the action as less morally acceptable compared to healthy controls. Although this might suggest an overreliance on action outcomes, it remains unclear why such alterations are not evident in other conditions as well (e.g., when autistic patients weigh the action-outcome stronger than the intention, they should rate attempted but not achieved harms as more morally acceptable, which they do not. For a detailed discussion on that topic see [53]). Accordingly, it might be that such tasks are suitable to detect alterations in ASD [29,54] and psychopathy [55] but are not sensitive enough to reveal the degree of alterations or the sub-aspect of ToM that is altered in SSD. Although ASD and SSD patients often reveal comparable behavioral ToM alterations[56], they are not necessarily caused by the same underlying malfunctioning mechanisms [57,58]. It is up to future replication studies to examine the sensitivity of this measure and to provide transdiagnostic analyses that will allow direct comparisons between clinical samples.

Although there is inconsistent evidence for a relation between antipsychotic medication and ToM performance in SSD [59,60], there remains the argument that behavioral alterations in SSD might be concealed by alleviating the effects of medication. To rule out an effect of antipsychotic medication on patients’ moral judgments, we correlated medication (standardized Chlorpromazine equivalent in mg/day; [61]) to task performance showing that moral judgments did not vary with the degree of antipsychotic medication.

At last, the current findings might support the notion that moral judgments are not (or minimally) impaired in SSD. This is well in line with several recent studies that reveal minimal support for a significant impairment in moral judgment in SSD [14,17], especially when judging moral dilemmas from the self-perspective. Another counter for the conception of schizophrenic patients as morally insensitive is provided by neuroeconomic studies revealing that patients react in similar manners to unfair behavior towards others [18,19]. Nonetheless, the findings that intention-based moral judgments are presumably preserved in SSD is puzzling, given the countless evidence for impaired ToM processes on the behavioral [6,7,62] and neural [7] level and the altered empathy processes evident in our sample. Although empathy and ToM are both crucial for interactions and share some overlapping cortical areas, both processes also relate to distinct regions [63]. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis showed that moral judgments are closer linked to ToM-related cortical areas than empathy-related areas which seemingly disapproves of a significant role of affect sharing during moral decision making [64]. Accordingly, our patient sample might suffer from decreased empathy while showing healthy-like moral judgments. Furthermore, patients with SSD can reveal altered cortical activation during moral decision making in ToM-related networks but simultaneously show no signs for altered behavioral moral judgments [17], which might account for the robust deficits identified in ToM studies [7,62] but preserved moral judgment in the current sample.

The current study supports previous evidence that SSD is not characterized by pronounced impairments in moral judgments, even when other people’s intentions must be considered. This is well in line with recent meta-analyses showing that SSD patients do not engage in more immoral and violent behavior than the average person [65,66].

4.1 Limitations and outlook

Whereas neuroimaging and behavioral examinations of moral reasoning in psychiatric samples such as schizophrenia are undoubtedly important, they bear several pitfalls. First (and as shortly mentioned in the introduction), findings on moral reasoning in schizophrenic patients are inconsistent and not all findings support the notion of impaired moral decision making or ToM in patients [18,19,67]. Second, although current research allows a better understanding of impaired behavioral outcomes and neuroimaging studies provide interesting insight into the cortical regions involved, most studies focus on certain sub-aspects of moral reasoning which are rarely put into a more exhaustive framework or model [23] and future studies must show how these sub-aspects integrate into a full model of morality in psychiatry.

Furthermore, we are yet far from an exhaustive understanding of how altered activation, connectivity or brain structure in psychiatric patients is related to behavioral outcome [68,69]. Whilst this is an ongoing issue not only in psychiatric research, the examination of morality bears a high responsibility, since it strongly influences the perception of how capable psychiatric patients are to understand their own actions. This in turn has an immediate influence on whether a psychiatric patient can be made responsible for his or her own actions which is an inevitable question when it comes to legal jurisdictions [68]. Taken together, there is a strong need for a more integrative account of morality in SSD, not only for research but also for a more sophisticated treatment of psychiatric patients in legal jurisdiction.

Preserved Intention Understanding During Moral Judgments in Schizophrenia

PLOS ONE

Dear Dr. Kronbichler,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.

Please could you pay careful attention to both reviewers' comments (please add ToM data on the subjects, if you have this, as recommended by Reviewer 1, if not it can be omitted). I also have some editorial comments as listed below: 

P3. I don’t think it is correct to say that social cognition is subsumed under theory of mind – most people would feel that the former is the broader construct.

P3. ‘Although there is evidence that patients show altered cortical activation during moral judgments [14], behavioral studies reveal mixed results showing fragile effects that often depend on question probe and perspective [13–16].

I don’ think it makes sense to juxtapose functional imaging and behavioural studies, especially as only one functional imaging study is cited. It might be better to have a paragraph in the discussion on functional imaging findings in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia.

P4. ‘Given that SSD patients have difficulties with belief understanding, we suggest that their ratings rely on the action outcome while neglecting the protagonist’s belief about his action.’

Please rephrase this sentence. If this is a hypothesis of the study, please indicate that this is the case. Alternatively, it might be better to remove it altogether.

P4-5. The paragraph on hypermentalizing would be better omitted, in my view. There has been almost no theoretical or experimental exploration of hypermentalizing in schizophrenia, and it is not clear what consequences it would have on a moral judgment task.

P5. ‘Participants in the patient group were 23 male adults, who had received a formal ICD-10 diagnosis (which was checked before study participation by certified psychiatrists)’

This statement does not meet accepted standards for meeting diagnostic criteria. Please expand on the process used. Please also move the section on exclusion criteria here.

Please separate the demographics table and the results table (which should be in a results section). Please move the text on empathy and cognition to before the table, so readers will know what the initials refer to. It is customary to give a measure like years of education or highest educational level achieved in a demographics table, so please include this if possible.

Please give considerably more detail on the Moral Judgements test, with at least one example. At the moment readers have to obtain and read reference 18 to know what the features of the test are. 

Please plan submit your revised manuscript in around three months or sooner. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at plosone@plos.org.

Reviewer #1: Thank you for inviting me to review this interesting manuscript, investigating a relatively neglected area of social cognition research in schizophrenia at the intersection between psy- and phil-disciplines. The study investigates differences between patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SSD) and healthy controls on a moral judgment task which requires the understanding of others’ intentions. This is an original and novel contribution to the field, which however presents some shortcomings and, in my opinion, could be improved in relation to a number of issues summarised below:

1. KEYWORDS: not fully representative. I would suggest considering, for example: “schizophrenia, moral cognition, social cognition, theory of mind, empathy”.

2. ABSTRACT: Originality, relevance and need for this research are identified and the new task is briefly introduced, along with a clear summary of the conclusions. However, the sentence “we examine whether patients with SSD reveal alterations in moral judgments when the intentions of the acting person must be considered.” is slightly misleading and needs re-reading a few times in order to grasp what component of moral reasoning or what faculty the authors are trying to investigate (and therefore the research question is not clearly defined). It seems to me that they are conflating theory of mind and moral reasoning, and that the question they are actually asking is whether lacking theory of mind impacts on moral reasoning? Research question and aims could therefore be made clearer in the abstract.

3. INTRODUCTION: The introduction lacks a rigorous and critical conceptual engagement with the neurophilosophical and neuropsychological literature on the topic. The authors seem to take for granted the evidence for deficits in ability to appreciate other people’s beliefs and intentions in relation to schizophrenia-spectrum disorders across different contexts, whereas the literature is mixed and the effect of considering different components of moral reasoning, as well as different contexts, should be discussed. See for example (McCABE et al., 2004) (Carlson & Crockett, 2018; Yu et al., 2019) (Bluhm et al., 2015). Morality judgments might occur at the intersection between different dimensions of social cognition including for example moral decision‐making, judgment, and inference (Yu et al., 2019), while the authors’ reduce the discussion to the “neuronal level” (lines 53-55). In addition, the ToM deficits evidenced in ASD and schizophrenia are not necessarily similar on a phenomenological level (Stanghellini & Ballerini, 2011) and this should be discussed. Lines 62-65 refer to different paradigms (studies 12,17,13) but then the authors fail to explicate pros/cons, just re-directing the reader to (study 13) for an example. I suggest that the complexity and challenges of investigating ethical reasoning in psychiatric disorders should be more clearly delineated and that a more balanced overview of the neuropsychological literature should be provided.

4. METHODOLOGY: The authors provide a measure of overall empathy but do not provide any information on ToM skills in their sample. This is surprising given that in the introduction they focus on impairment both in ToM and empathy. Could their sample just have normal ToM? Other measures and statistics appear adequate but I cannot see any controlling for potential confounding factors.

5. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Results are presented clearly and logically, and discussed in a stepwise fashion.

Reviewer #2: Dear editors of PlosOne,

It has been a pleasure to review the manuscript by Kronbichler et al. entitled "Preserved Intention Understanding During Moral Judgments in Schizophrenia". This work deals with a clearly stated and interesting set of hypotheses and, in general, it has been correctly conducted. My comments are related to minor methodological aspects of the work. Specifically:

1.- The nature of the main analysis (three way, repeated measures ANOVA) should be stated in the Methods section (not in the results section as it is now).

2.- Exhaustive results from the non-bayesian ANOVA should be provided in a table.

3.- Results from post-hoc tests (one per each of the 2x2 conditions, comparing patients and controls) shouldn't be included in the demographics table (table 1) but in the ANOVA table (see point 1) or in a table of its own.

4.- Boxplots from Figure 1, clearly reveal that for some of the conditions (specially intended harm and neutral acts) there are some prominent floor and ceiling effects (observations gathered at extreme values) and net differences in variances between conditions, which, may violate the assumptions for parametric analyses.

Still, I understand that fitting a non-parametric version of a three way, repeated measures ANOVA may be difficult and unreliable, and we may consider results provided as valid. However, at least within condition two group comparisons (post-hoc t-test) should be supplemented with results from non-parametric tests (ideally permutation tests) .

5.- The inclusion of Bayesian results is also informative and reinforces the classic ANOVA outcome (both analyses agree in broad terms) however, due to the non-familiarity of some of the readers with Bayesian methods, a clear explanation on the different statistics reported (mainly Bayes Factors) should be included in the text.

6.- Finally, Table captions are very poor and should be improved by including extensive information on tables contents.

Dear Reviewers, dear Editor,

Thank you so much for putting your valuable time into this review. We hope that our changes suit your expectations and we sincerely want to thank you for helping to improve our manuscript. The list of changes is attached below in the initial order of the review.

Editor

P3. I don’t think it is correct to say that social cognition is subsumed under theory of mind – most people would feel that the former is the broader construct.

Thank you, of course you are right, the wording of this sentence was misleading. We rewrote this sentence, describing TOM as a (sub)factor or social cognition, which better fits the common description of TOM.

P3. ‘Although there is evidence that patients show altered cortical activation during moral judgments [14], behavioral studies reveal mixed results showing fragile effects that often depend on question probe and perspective [13–16].

● I don’ think it makes sense to juxtapose functional imaging and behavioural studies, especially as only one functional imaging study is cited. It might be better to have a paragraph in the discussion on functional imaging findings in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia.

We rewrote the introduction and avoided a direct comparison between neuroimaging and behavioral data since juxtaposing behavioral and neuroimaging data is misleading. Since we nonetheless provide information on both data types, we now explicitly state in the discussion that neuroimaging does not directly map on behavior.

P4. ‘Given that SSD patients have difficulties with belief understanding, we suggest that their ratings rely on the action outcome while neglecting the protagonist’s belief about his action.’

● Please rephrase this sentence. If this is a hypothesis of the study, please indicate that this is the case. Alternatively, it might be better to remove it altogether.

Since this is one of our assumptions about the task, we rephrased the sentence. It now reads: ‘If our SSD sample has difficulties understanding the intention and belief of the story protagonist, we should find that patients mostly rely their ratings on the action outcome since the intention of the protagonist (to harm or not to harm the other person) is not informative to them.’

P4-5. The paragraph on hypermentalizing would be better omitted, in my view. There has been almost no theoretical or experimental exploration of hypermentalizing in schizophrenia, and it is not clear what consequences it would have on a moral judgment task.

This section was mostly added for the sake of completeness - I removed it.

P5. ‘Participants in the patient group were 23 male adults, who had received a formal ICD-10 diagnosis (which was checked before study participation by certified psychiatrists)’

● This statement does not meet accepted standards for meeting diagnostic criteria. Please expand on the process used.

Patients were examined using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al. 1998) This is now stated in the Participant section.

● Please also move the section on exclusion criteria here.

Exclusion criteria were moved upwards.

Please separate the demographics table and the results table (which should be in a results section). Please move the text on empathy and cognition to before the table, so readers will know what the initials refer to. It is customary to give a measure like years of education or highest educational level achieved in a demographics table, so please include this if possible.

Demographics and results are now presented in separate Tables (T1,T2). Education level was added to Table 1.

Please give considerably more detail on the Moral Judgements test, with at least one example. At the moment readers have to obtain and read reference 18 to know what the features of the test are.

The task description was rewritten and is now described using an example story. We hope that this facilitates the understanding of this task. Furthermore, two complete stories are now added to the supplementary material.

2.) Please describe in your methods section how capacity to consent was determined for the participants in this study.

Thank you for pointing this out, since this is an extremely important topic. Patient capacity to participate (and give informed consent) was determined in two steps: First, only patients authorized to give informed consent were taken into account. Patients under external custody (either due to their age or their mental state) were not included. Furthermore, all patients were recruited by their treating clinical psychiatrists, and only patients whose mental state was considered stable enough were recruited. There were no exceptions to this procedure.

The methods section now contains this statement: Only participants who were authorized to give informed consent themselves (>18 years, not under external custody) were included in the study. Furthermore, patient recruitment was exclusively done by an experienced team of psychiatrists.

3.) Please include additional information regarding the vignettes used in the study and ensure that you have provided sufficient details that others could replicate the analyses. For instance, if you developed vignettes as part of this study and they is not under a copyright more restrictive than CC-BY, please include a copy, in both the original language and English, as Supporting Information. If materials, methods, and protocols are well established, authors may cite articles where those protocols are described in detail, but the submission should include sufficient information to be understood independent of these references (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods).

The test material is well established (Moran et al., 2011) and described in detail there. To nonetheless get a better idea of how the stories are designed, we added the english and german versions of two example vignettes in the supplementary material.

4.) We note that you have indicated that data from this study are available upon request. PLOS only allows data to be available upon request if there are legal or ethical restrictions on sharing data publicly. For more information on unacceptable data access restrictions, please see http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions.

In your revised cover letter, please address the following prompts:

a) If there are ethical or legal restrictions on sharing a de-identified data set, please explain them in detail (e.g., data contain potentially sensitive information, data are owned by a third-party organization, etc.) and who has imposed them (e.g., an ethics committee). Please also provide contact information for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent.

The following statement is also included in the cover letter:

Currently, we do not have approval from the local ethical committee responsible for this study (Ethikkommission des Landes Salzburg - Ethics committee of the regional state of Salzburg) to publicly share single patients data of any sort, without the explicit consent of patients to share their individual data publicly. Since our study consent form did not include such a clause, we are not allowed to make single-subject data publicly available. For data access, please write an email to the corresponding author, which will clarify the potential to share the data with the local ethics committee. We are currently trying to obtain a more general allowance from the ethics committee for sharing at least the single subject behavioural data but this process will take a while. If a more general data sharing allowance is obtained, we will update the information with the article and share the data on a public repository (if allowed).

Reviewer #1:

Thank you for inviting me to review this interesting manuscript, investigating a relatively neglected area of social cognition research in schizophrenia at the intersection between psy- and phil-disciplines. The study investigates differences between patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SSD) and healthy controls on a moral judgment task which requires the understanding of others’ intentions. This is an original and novel contribution to the field, which however presents some shortcomings and, in my opinion, could be improved in relation to a number of issues summarised below:

1. KEYWORDS: not fully representative. I would suggest considering, for example: “schizophrenia, moral cognition, social cognition, theory of mind, empathy”.

Keywords were changed accordingly. The term “schizophrenia” was omitted since it is already present in the title.

2. ABSTRACT: Originality, relevance and need for this research are identified and the new task is briefly introduced, along with a clear summary of the conclusions. However, the sentence “we examine whether patients with SSD reveal alterations in moral judgments when the intentions of the acting person must be considered.” is slightly misleading and needs re-reading a few times in order to grasp what component of moral reasoning or what faculty the authors are trying to investigate (and therefore the research question is not clearly defined). It seems to me that they are conflating theory of mind and moral reasoning, and that the question they are actually asking is whether lacking theory of mind impacts on moral reasoning? Research question and aims could therefore be made clearer in the abstract.

This section of the abstract was rewritten in order to make our research interest clearer.

3. INTRODUCTION: The introduction lacks a rigorous and critical conceptual engagement with the neurophilosophical and neuropsychological literature on the topic. The authors seem to take for granted the evidence for deficits in ability to appreciate other people’s beliefs and intentions in relation to schizophrenia-spectrum disorders across different contexts, whereas the literature is mixed and the effect of considering different components of moral reasoning, as well as different contexts, should be discussed. See for example (McCABE et al., 2004) (Carlson & Crockett, 2018; Yu et al., 2019) (Bluhm et al., 2015).

Morality judgments might occur at the intersection between different dimensions of social cognition including for example moral decision‐making, judgment, and inference (Yu et al., 2019), while the authors’ reduce the discussion to the “neuronal level” (lines 53-55). In addition, the ToM deficits evidenced in ASD and schizophrenia are not necessarily similar on a phenomenological level (Stanghellini & Ballerini, 2011) and this should be discussed. Lines 62-65 refer to different paradigms (studies 12,17,13) but then the authors fail to explicate pros/cons, just re-directing the reader to (study 13) for an example. I suggest that the complexity and challenges of investigating ethical reasoning in psychiatric disorders should be more clearly delineated and that a more balanced overview of the neuropsychological literature should be provided.

We mostly rewrote the introduction to provide a more sophisticated overview of the currently existing literature. We found that some of your suggestions would better fit in the discussion section of the paper, therefore we moved aspects like the link between neuroimaging and behavioral data there. We hope this is alright, since we wanted to incorporate all the valuable suggestions made by the reviewer.

4. METHODOLOGY: The authors provide a measure of overall empathy but do not provide any information on ToM skills in their sample. This is surprising given that in the introduction they focus on impairment both in ToM and empathy. Could their sample just have normal ToM? Other measures and statistics appear adequate but I cannot see any controlling for potential confounding factors.

Unfortunately, data on TOM skills are not available for this sample.

Correlation analyses are (and were in the first manuscript) reported examining the influence of symptom severity, medication and illness duration. We politely refer to paragraph 2 in the results section: Pearson Correlations indicate that symptom severity (PANSS) and medication (Chlorpromazine equivalent) were not related to task performance (rs < .38, ps > .09). Illness duration was moderately related to permissibility ratings in Intended Harm scenarios (r = .41, p = .052).

5. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Results are presented clearly and logically, and discussed in a stepwise fashion.

Reviewer #2:

Dear editors of PlosOne,

It has been a pleasure to review the manuscript by Kronbichler et al. entitled "Preserved Intention Understanding During Moral Judgments in Schizophrenia". This work deals with a clearly stated and interesting set of hypotheses and, in general, it has been correctly conducted. My comments are related to minor methodological aspects of the work. Specifically:

1.- The nature of the main analysis (three way, repeated measures ANOVA) should be stated in the Methods section (not in the results section as it is now).

The description is moved to the methods section.

2.- Exhaustive results from the non-bayesian ANOVA should be provided in a table.

Descriptives, results of the ANOVA and t-test are now listed in Table 2.

3.- Results from post-hoc tests (one per each of the 2x2 conditions, comparing patients and controls) shouldn't be included in the demographics table (table 1) but in the ANOVA table (see point 1) or in a table of its own.

See point above.

4.- Boxplots from Figure 1, clearly reveal that for some of the conditions (specially intended harm and neutral acts) there are some prominent floor and ceiling effects (observations gathered at extreme values) and net differences in variances between conditions, which, may violate the assumptions for parametric analyses.

Still, I understand that fitting a non-parametric version of a three way, repeated measures ANOVA may be difficult and unreliable, and we may consider results provided as valid. However, at least within condition two group comparisons (post-hoc t-test) should be supplemented with results from non-parametric tests (ideally permutation tests) .

Thank you sincerely for pointing this out. For the sake of simplicity (we felt the results section is already pretty long), we added the permutation test results in the supplementary material and mentioned their similar outcome in our results section.

5.- The inclusion of Bayesian results is also informative and reinforces the classic ANOVA outcome (both analyses agree in broad terms) however, due to the non-familiarity of some of the readers with Bayesian methods, a clear explanation on the different statistics reported (mainly Bayes Factors) should be included in the text.

Thank you for pointing this out. Although quite informative, the idea behind bayes statistics is not (yet) as popular as conventional NHST. Therefore, we added a short paragraph (2.5) where we describe the meaning of bayes factors and refer to practical guides for a more in depth description.

6.- Finally, Table captions are very poor and should be improved by including extensive information on tables contents.

Table captions were rewritten and provide more information now.

Preserved intention understanding during moral judgments in schizophrenia

PLOS ONE

Dear Dr. Kronbicher,

Thank you for submitting your revised manuscript to PLOS ONE. It is now nearly ready for acceptance but there are few minor issues that need addressing:

1. The article is understandable but the use of English has frequent grammatical errors, particularly with regard to  tense. If you were able to have a native English speaker review the text this would be helpful.

2. P7. 'The study was part of a longitudinal study including behavioral and MRI acquisitions in affective and psychotic disorders approved by the local ethics committee'. This sentence is unnecessary and confusing, as you have already stated that the study had ethics committee approval - please remove or amend.

3. P17. You begin a paragraph of the discussion with 'Probably the mainstream opener when discussing a null effect...'. It would be better to replace this with something like 'Probably the most important consideration for a null effect...'.

4. Please incorporate the two footnotes into the main body of the text.

We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.

Kind regards,

Peter John McKenna
