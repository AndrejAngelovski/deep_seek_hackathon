In the original article, we neglected to include the funder “European Research Council (ERC), ERC Consolidator Award” to Professor Sukhwinder S. Shergill.

A correction has therefore been made to Acknowledgments and the correct statement appears below:

“This work was funded by the Wellcome Trust. SS received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Award. The authors gratefully acknowledge the generous assistance of Cambian Healthcare in the data collection. The authors have no financial interests to disclose.”

The authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way. The original article has been updated.
