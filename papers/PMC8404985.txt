Background and aims

Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance globally. In this systematic review, we examined the prevalence and trends of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder in Iran.

Methods

We searched International and Iranian databases up to March 2021. Pooled prevalence of use among sex subgroups of the general population, university and high school students, combined youth groups, and high-risk groups was estimated through random-effects model. Trends of various use indicators and national seizures were examined.

Results

Ninety studies were included. The prevalence estimates of last 12-month cannabis use were 1.3% (95%CI: 0.1–3.6) and 0.2% (95%CI: 0.1–0.3) among the male and female Iranian general population, respectively. The prevalence of cannabis use disorder among general population in national studies rose from 0% in 2001 to 0.5% in 2011. In the 2016–2020 period, the pooled prevalence estimates of last 12-month cannabis use were 4.9% (95% CI: 3.4–6.7) and 0.3% (95% CI: 0.0–1.3) among males and females of “combined youth groups”, respectively. The linear trend of last 12-month cannabis use among males of "combined youth groups" and among female university students increased significantly from 2000 to 2020.

Conclusions

Prevalence of cannabis use in Iran is low compared to many countries. However, there is strong evidence of an increase in cannabis use among the youth and some evidence for an increase in cannabis use disorder.

==== Body
Introduction

Cannabis is the most widely used and trafficked illicit substance in the world with 192 million cannabis users globally in 2018 [1]. The prevalence of cannabis use in the last 12-month has been increasing in the last decade, reaching 3.9% of individuals aged 15–64 years [1]. Cannabis use has been legalized and regulated in several countries in recent years and the effect of policy changes on the extent of use and its health consequences are under close monitoring.

Cannabis abuse and dependence potential have been demonstrated, mainly linked to tetra-hydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) concentrations, the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis [2]. Some estimates indicate that one-tenth of cannabis users can become dependent [3, 4]. Moreover, adverse effects on brain development, acting as a gateway drug, and triggering psychiatric disorders have been linked to the regular and early age of cannabis use [5]. Low birthweight, motor vehicle injuries, and bronchitis are also among the health-related harms associated with recreational cannabis use [6].

While opium is the main illicit drug used in Iran, cannabis has also been used for a long time in the country. The use of cannabis goes back at least to the 16th century when cannabis was used in types of religious ceremonies by Sufis [7]. Currently, there is no licit or medical production of cannabis in Iran, and the rulings have considered a strict prohibition on its use [8]. However, there are some concerns that cannabis use is increasing in the country and is becoming an important public health problem. Several studies have examined the prevalence of cannabis use along with other drugs in the general population. Previously, a systematic review was conducted up to 2014 on the lifetime cannabis use among Iranian university and high-school students [9]. However, we know little about the prevalence of cannabis use in other Iranian population subgroups, other use indicators among various populations, and the extent of cannabis use disorder in Iran. This study aimed to use the available data to provide 1) the estimate of cannabis use (lifetime, last 12-months, last month and current, daily or almost daily use), 2) the estimate of cannabis use disorder, both in the subgroups of Iranian population (general population, youth, university students, high school students, and high-risk groups), and 3) the trends of estimates until 2020.

Methods

Search strategy

Three international databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed) and an Iranian database, the Scientific Information Database (SID), were searched from January 1990 up to 16 March 2021. As the first legislation changes on cannabis use in the countries initiated in 1990s, we extended our search limit to 1990 to be able to investigate the trend. Furthermore, we 1) hand-searched the reference list of the retrieved scientific documents (backward citation tracking), 2) communicated with experts in the field of addiction (principle investigators of national or large studies) in Iran to access unpublished studies, such as thesis and unpublished reports, 3) hand-searched final reports of studies of Drug Control Headquarters’ resources, and 4) hand-searched the Iranian National Center of Addiction Studies (INCAS) archives on Iranian epidemiological studies.

Search strategy (S1 Table) for the international databases was developed using three groups of key-terms which were combined using Boolean operators: 1) general terms related to drug use or drug use disorder; 2) the names of substances commonly used in Iran including different forms of cannabis, opioids, stimulants, and alcohol; 3) keywords related to Iran, including names of provinces and major cities. Keywords related to other substances were added to the search strategy in order not to miss relevant studies without cannabis-related terms in the title or abstract. No restrictions were applied to the study design. The Iranian database was searched only with the Persian and English words for different forms of cannabis.

Eligibility criteria and screening

All studies providing the prevalence of cannabis use or use disorder among the Iranian population were included. Whatever criteria of cannabis use disorder were applied, the studies were included -either based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version IV or V or any other definitions. The applied criteria were reported exactly as stated in the study.

The eligible target population was the general population, university students, high school students, and the high-risk population. Based on our previous reviews [10, 11], these groups were the main targets investigated in prevalence studies and therefore were selected. Any population representative of the Iranian population and not considered high-risk for substance use and use disorder was classified as "general population", including population being sampled in household surveys, from public places, in industrial settings, or health centers irrelevant to substance use. ​Some studies on the general population recruited only youths, and some included a population of 15 years and over or 18 years and over. Therefore, we requested the authors of the latter studies to provide age-group specific data and we created a separate population category, "young general population", with a wide age definition of 15–34 years. Any specific population that was assumed to have with higher rates of substance use and use disorder than the general population was categorized as a "high-risk population".

Studies were excluded if the use or use disorder indicator was not reported or unclear, the prevalence of different types of cannabis (resin and plant) was reported separately without reporting the merged prevalence of any cannabis use or use disorder, if was case-control or interventional study, and the source population was not eligible.

Screening of the retrieved documents was carried out in two stages: screening of the titles and abstracts for including all relevant studies and assessment of the full texts for eligibility criteria. Two different reviewers (MAE, SB, MH, YRA, and HR) conducted both stages independently, and inconsistencies were resolved by a third reviewer (ARM).

Data extraction and quality assessment

For each included study, the following data were extracted: first author, publication year, the language of the manuscript, the year of the study implementation, recruitment setting(s), target population, study location (province), sampling method, sample size, response rate, age characteristics of the participants, use indicator(s), criteria used for diagnosis of use disorder, and finally the prevalence of cannabis use and use disorder in each sex subgroup. Quality of the included studies was assessed using a 9-item rating adapted from Joanna Briggs Institute quality assessment tool [12] and previously used in other studies by our group [10, 11] (S2 Table). Two different investigators (SB, MH, YRA, and HR) independently extracted data from the included studies, and the discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (ARM).

Statistical analysis

Characteristics of all included studies, their findings on the prevalence of cannabis use and use disorder, and the results of quality assessment of each included study were recorded in tables separately for the general population, university students, high school students, and high-risk populations (including people who use drugs (PWUD), prisoners, and other high-risk groups).

All eligible studies, which reported prevalence separately in the two sexes, were included in the meta-analysis. Studies not reporting sex-specific data were not included in the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of cannabis use was estimated using the "metaprop" command ("metafor" package) separately by sex, population subgroups (general population, young general population, university students, high school students, and high-risk groups), timeframe and frequency of use (lifetime, last 12-month, last month or current, daily or almost daily, current main drug), and study year (2000–2005, 2006–2010, 2011–2015, and 2016–2020). The studies conducted before 2000 did not provide sex-specific data therefore were not entered in the analyses. The pooled prevalence estimates in each sex and population subgroups were presented using separate forest plots. Random-effects models were used for pooling the estimates and Freeman–Tukey double arcsine transformation was used for stabilizing the variance. The heterogeneity between studies was quantified by the I2 statistic. We also conducted meta-regression analyses via the "metareg" command ("metafor" package) to examine the association between the prevalence of cannabis use and several covariates including sex, timeframe and frequency, study year, number of unmet quality criteria, and study population (young general population, university students, high school, and high-risk population, all versus the general population). We broke down studies providing estimates among both sexes or on various timeframes and frequencies and regarded them as separate studies in the model. If studies were based on network scale-up (NSU) method (an indirect estimation by measuring the respondents’ networks size and the number of cannabis users in their network [13]), we excluded them from the meta-analysis model and only presented them in the relative tables so that the results would be comparable. Moreover, to assess the effect of quality of studies on pooled estimates, sensitivity analyses were performed by removing studies with more than two unmet items on the quality scale.

Due to the scarcity of data for some periods, we merged studies among the young general population, university students, and high school students under the "combined youth groups" category for trend plot. We categorized studies into four periods as follows: 2000–2005; 2006–2010; 2011–2015; and 2016–2020; in order to have enough data points for trend analysis. We plotted the pooled prevalence of the last 12-month, last month or current, and daily or almost daily use of cannabis among males and females of “combined youth groups” for each period using the "ggplot" command ("ggplot2" package). As the heterogeneity among the "combined youth groups" was high and might have obscured trend patterns, we also analyzed the trends in the prevalence of the last 12-month use of cannabis among male and female university students, which had enough numbers in each period using similar methodology. Similarly, among the regional subgroups of the "combined youth groups", there were adequate number of studies only for Tehran province to perform trend analysis. We were not able to provide a trend plot for studies conducted among the general population due to the limited number of studies in each period. The pooled estimates are presented in the middle of each period. We fitted meta-regression lines for assessing the significance of the slope of the trend lines. Moreover, the data on national seizures of cannabis in 100 metric tonnes (annually from 1990 to 2018) [14] are presented in the trend plot for better interpretation of the results.

All statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 4.0.3) and geographical distribution map of the prevalence of the last 12-month cannabis use among “combined youth groups” was provided using ArcGIS software (version 10.5). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used for reporting this systematic review and meta-analysis study.

Results

Through the search of international databases, and after excluding the duplicates, titles and abstracts of 3,686 records were reviewed (Fig 1). Of all these records, 285 were eligible for full-text review. Additionally, from 2,530 records found in the SID, only four records were eligible for full-text review. Through contact with experts, backward citation tracking and other opportunistic methods, 50 other studies were also identified. A total of 90 studies were included in the final sample providing the prevalence of cannabis use or use disorder among the general population (N = 12), young general population (N = 9), university students (N = 33), high school students (N = 18), and high-risk groups (N = 22). Four studies provided measures for both the general population and young general population. Overall, 37.8% of the reports were in Persian and the remaining 62.2% were in English. Among the 50 studies included through opportunistic methods, 17 were not published in peer-reviewed journals (two unpublished studies, six theses, and nine final reports of studies). From these 17 studies, only one study had more than two unmet quality criteria that was not included in the meta-analysis as sex-specific data was not reported. In total, one study was excluded from the meta-analysis due to the application of the NSU method, and nine studies as sex-specific data were not reported. The characteristics and results of the studies are presented in Tables 1–4 based on the target population.

General population

Twelve studies provided the prevalence of cannabis use among the Iranian general population with a total sample size of 131,345 (53.7% male) from 2001 to 2016 (Table 1). Six studies were conducted nationally between 2001 and 2015 and the other six studies were conducted in three different provinces. Eight reports were based on household surveys, and the others recruited their samples from the street, industrial plants, hospitals, or a clinical laboratory. The mean age of the participants ranged from 30.8 to 40.2 years. The pooled prevalence estimates of lifetime cannabis use were 2.7% (95%CI: 0.6–6.1; I2 = 98.0%; 5 studies; Table 5 and S1 Fig) in men and 0.3% (95%CI: 0.0–0.7; I2 = 90.6%; 5 studies; Table 5 and S2 Fig) in women. The prevalence estimates of use in the last 12-month were 1.3% (95%CI: 0.1–3.6; I2 = 97.0%; 2 studies) and 0.2% (95%CI: 0.1–0.3; I2 = 0.0%; 2 studies) in men and women, respectively. The pooled prevalence of last month or current cannabis use were 0.8% (95%CI: 0.4–1.2; I2 = 52.4%; 5 studies) in men and 0.1% (95%CI: 0.0–0.3; I2 = 63.7%; 4 studies) in women. The pooled estimates for daily or almost daily use were 0.9% (95%CI: 0.5–1.4; I2 = 0.0%; 2 studies) in men and 0.03% (95%CI: 0.0–0.5; I2 = 68.2%; 2 studies) in women.

Three studies provided the prevalence of cannabis use disorder among the general population in 2001 and 2011- both nationally- and in 2003 in Fars province. The prevalence of cannabis use disorder in national studies rose from 0% in 2001 to 0.5% in 2011 (Table 1).

Young general population

We found 9 studies spanning years 2004 to 2020 that reported on the prevalence of cannabis use in the general population aged under 34 years with a total sample size of 28,770 (42.0% male) (Table 1). Of these, one study was conducted nationally and the others were conducted in five different provinces. One study was a prospective biennial cohort study in four different provinces [27]; each round has been presented separately in the relative table and figure. The recruitment settings of included studies were household, street or public places. In the male subgroup, the pooled prevalence estimates were 7.7% (95%CI: 4.5–11.8; I2 = 97.6%; 6 studies) for lifetime cannabis use, 3.8% (95%CI: 2.2–5.9; I2 = 92.7%; 2 studies) for last-12 month use and 0.8% (95%CI: 0.04–2.1; I2 = 2.7%; 2 studies) for last month or current use (Table 5 and S3 Fig). Among the female subgroup, the corresponding estimates were 0.7% (95%CI: 0.04–1.8; I2 = 97.0%; 5 studies) for lifetime use, 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0–0.7; I2 = 90.0%; 3 studies) for last 12-month use, and 0.3% (95%CI: 0.0–2.1; I2 = 69.9; 2 studies) for last month or current use (Table 5 and S4 Fig). Three studies provided the prevalence of daily or almost daily use with the pooled estimate of 0.5% (95%CI: 0.0–1.7; I2 = 77.8%; 3 studies) in men and 0.0% (95%CI: 0.0–1.1; I2 = 14.2%; 3 studies) in women. No study provided data regarding cannabis use disorder among the young general population.

University students

Thirty-three studies spanning the years 1998 to 2018 reported on the prevalence of cannabis use among university students with a total sample of 111,600 (44.4% male) (Table 2). Three of these were national studies, two conducted in 2012 and one in 2016, two other studies were conducted in 5 provinces, and the other studies were conducted in thirteen different provinces. One study was a repeated survey in one large medical university in Tehran [49]; each year has been presented separately in the relative table and figure. The mean age of respondents ranged from 20.1 to 23.0 years in different studies. Among male students, the pooled prevalence estimate of cannabis use was 5.7% (95%CI: 4.3–7.3; I2 = 96.9%; 20 studies) for lifetime use, 2.9% (95%CI: 1.8–4.4; I2 = 96.6%; 12 studies) for 12-month use, and 1.7% (95%CI: 0.9–2.7; I2 = 95.4%; 9 studies) for last month or current use (Table 5 and S5 Fig). Corresponding estimates were 1.1% (95%CI: 0.6–1.7; I2 = 96.2%; 19 studies), 0.6% (95%CI: 0.3–1.0; I2 = 93.7%; 11 studies), and 0.3% (95%CI: 0.1–0.6; I2 = 89.8%; 9 studies), respectively among female students (Table 5 and S6 Fig). Across all years, 0.4% (95%CI: 0.1–0.7; I2 = 69.1%; 5 studies) of male students and 0.02% (95%CI: 0.0–0.1; I2 = 0.5%; 4 studies) of female students reported daily or almost daily use of cannabis. No study was found on cannabis use disorder among the university students.

High school students

We found 18 studies spanning years 2000 to 2018 that reported on the prevalence of cannabis use in high school students with a total sample size of 32,867 (56.9% male) (Table 3). One study was conducted nationally, another was conducted in 9 provinces, and the other studies were conducted in eight different provinces. The mean ages of respondents ranged from 13.6 to 17.9 years. The pooled estimates of lifetime prevalence of cannabis use were 3.2% (95%CI: 1.7–5.3; I2 = 97.0%; 14 studies) and 0.3% (95%CI: 0.0–0.9; I2 = 91.8%; 10 studies) in male and female students, respectively. Only one study reported on the last 12-month prevalence among high-school students, 1.0% of male and 0.0% of female students report such use [74]. The pooled prevalence of last month or current use were 3.2% (95%CI: 1.4–5.6; 6 studies) among male students (Table 5 and S7 Fig) and 0.6% (95%CI: 0.1–1.7; I2 = 91.8%; 5 studies) among female students (Table 5 and S8 Fig). The corresponding estimates for daily or almost daily use were 2.7% (95%CI: 1.6–3.9; I2 = 28.7; 2 studies) and 0.3% (95%CI: 0.05–0.7; I2 = 0.0%; 2 studies) among male and female students, respectively. Cannabis use disorder was assessed in only in one study. Conducted in 2001 among male students in one province, no current use disorder was detected among the students.

High-risk groups

In total, 22 studies reported on cannabis use among high-risk population groups in Iran (Table 4). We categorized these studies based on their target population into PWUD (10 studies), prisoners (5 studies), and other high-risk groups (7 studies).

People who use drugs

We found 7 studies spanning years 1998 to 2018 reporting the prevalence of cannabis use among PWUD with a total sample size of 35,366. Four of these were repeated national situation assessment surveys conducted in 1998, 2004, 2007 and 2018. S9 Fig presents the prevalence of cannabis use among PWUD based on timeframe and frequency. The pooled estimate of lifetime and last month or current cannabis use were 38.8% (33.3–44.4; I2 = 97.7%; 5 studies) and 16.2% (11.3–21.8; I2 = 99.2%; 6 studies), respectively. Only the latest national survey conducted in 2018 assessed the prevalence of last 12-month and daily use of cannabis, estimated at 29.8% and 11.9%, respectively [84].

The four national situation assessment surveys have assessed the prevalence of cannabis being the current main drug of use among the PWUD (S9 Fig). The corresponding figure was 12.5% in the latest study in 2018. Three other studies reported on treatment-seeking and treatment referral for cannabis use among PWUD. The results of these studies are not presented in the forest plot. Two of these studies reported on treatment-seeking for cannabis use. One recruited 988 PWUD (93.2% male) referred for treatment in 2015–19 from one treatment centre. Of these, 10.9% of men and 9.0% of women sought treatment for cannabis use disorder [85]. The other study recruited 4400 individuals from drug rehabilitation centres in 2014–15, 3.7% of male and 0.9% of female clients were referred for cannabis use disorder [87]. A third study assessed lifetime cannabis dependence (based on DSM-IV) among patients referred for treatment of opioid dependence; 25.7% of the male patients and 5.0% of the female patients met these criteria [88].

Prisoners

Five studies spanning years 2007 to 2015 examined the prevalence of cannabis use in a total sample of 9,112 prisoners (97.9% male). One study was conducted nationally, another was conducted in 6 provinces, and the other three were conducted in three different provinces. The pooled lifetime prevalence of cannabis use in these studies was 5.4% (95%CI: 2.7–8.8; I2 = 96.0%; 5 studies; S10 Fig). Current use of cannabis was reported in 0.2% male prisoners in one study and 15.7% in the other. No study evaluated cannabis use disorder among the prisoners.

Other high-risk groups

Three studies were conducted among homeless individuals [99, 101, 104]. One only recruited homeless individuals aged between 15–29 years, reported 8.5% of total sample (N = 202) had used cannabis in the last month [99]. In the other two studies, 3.6% (N = 193) and 2.7% (N = 513) of male homeless people and no one (N = 80) among female subgroup reported current cannabis use [101, 104].

The other four studies were conducted among other high-risk subgroups (Table 4). One study conducted among female sex workers in 13 large cities in the country in 2015 (N = 1347), reported a 2.7% prevalence of cannabis use in the last month [102]. One other study reported that among male motorcycle drivers (N = 414) in a large city, 2.4% had used cannabis more than once per week in lifetime [100]. Another study conducted among male long-distance truck drivers (N = 349) reported a lifetime prevalence of cannabis use of 0.9% [103]. Finally, the seventh study recruited offspring of people with opioid dependence referred to a treatment centre (N = 500; 45% male; mostly 20–29 years) [105]. Of these, 2.6% of the offspring reported lifetime cannabis use.

Heterogeneity study

The meta-regression analysis showed that the prevalence of cannabis use was significantly higher in males compared to females (p<0.001), high-risk population compared to the general population (p<0.001), and young age group to the general population (p = 0.01). Prevalence estimates of last 12-month and daily and almost daily use were lower compared to lifetime use (p = 0.03 and 0.006 respectively). Other variables (i.e. study year, number of unfulfilled quality criteria and other participant groups) showed no significant association with cannabis use prevalence (S3 Table).

Trend

Fig 2 and S4 Table present the trends in the prevalence of cannabis use according to timeframe and frequency of use. To evaluate changes in cannabis use over time, we pooled data from all studies conducted in youth. Sixty studies reported on the prevalence of cannabis use among youths (nine in the young general population, 33 in university students, and 18 in high school students).

10.1371/journal.pone.0256563.g002 Fig 2 Time trend of cannabis use among “combined youth group” and national seizures of cannabis (100 metric tonnes- both resin and plant forms).

The cannabis use among male and female of “combined youth groups” were pooled for 2000–2005, 2006–2010, 2011–2015, and 2016–2020 periods and were plotted in the middle of each period.

Among males in this combined sample of studies, the prevalence of last 12-month use of cannabis increased significantly from 2000 to 2020 (b = 0.05; P = 0.035). The last 12-month prevalence was 2.3% (95%CI: 0.7–4.7%; I2 = 87.3%; 3 studies) in years before 2005 and reached 4.9% (95%CI: 3.4–6.7; I2 = 94.8%; 4 studies) in the 2016–2020 period. The linear trends in the lifetime or last month or current prevalence were not significant (S4 Table). Among females, the prevalence estimate did not change for any timeframes (S4 Table). The pooled estimates of cannabis use in different periods based on sex subgroups are shown in Table 5. The time trend was somewhat different in university student samples. While there was no significant trend in the prevalence of last 12-month cannabis use among male university students (b = 0.004; P = 0.3); the linear trend of last 12-month cannabis use among female university students showed a significant increase from 2000 to 2020 (b = 0.005; P = 0.02).

The time trend of the prevalence of last 12-month use of cannabis among the "combined youth group" in Tehran province was investigated, as well. The linear trends were significant both in the males (b = 0.01; P = 0.01) and female (b = 0.008; P = 0.006) subgroups. It should be noted than except one, the other studies in Tehran were conducted among the university students.

Geographical distribution

S11 Fig shows the pooled prevalence of last 12-month cannabis use in male and female in the combined youth group in six provinces in Iran. No data were available at province level for 25 other provinces. The highest prevalence in the male combined youth group was reported in the Fars province (7.3%; one study). Whereas, the highest prevalence in the female combined youth group was reported from Tehran province (0.6%; six studies).

Quality assessment

The number of unfulfilled quality items for all studies is presented in Tables 1–4. Among the 90 studies, there were only six with three unfulfilled items out of the nine. No study had more than three unfulfilled quality items. With the removal of one study in the young female general population [28], the pooled estimate of last 12-month cannabis use among the young female general population was reduced from 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0–0.7) to 0.04% (95%CI: 0.0–1.3). With the removal of another study among PWUD [89], the pooled estimate of last month or current use in this population changed from 16.2% (95%CI: 11.3–21.8) to 12.2% (95%CI: 8.3–16.8). Removal of the study among the male general population from the meta-analysis changed the pooled estimate of last month or current use less than 0.1% [25]. The other three studies were not included in the meta-analysis [19, 83, 103].

Discussion

The current study is the first systematic review in Iran to provide an estimate of various cannabis use indicators–i.e., lifetime, last 12-month, last month or current, and daily or almost daily use—among the general population and high-risk population, in addition to the youths. In addition, this is the first review on the prevalence of cannabis use disorder in Iran. Due to the extensive search applied in this study, we could successfully retrieve 50 studies with high quality not identified from the online databases. The previous systematic review conducted up to 2014 on the lifetime cannabis use [9], including a total of 33 studies had supporting results, 4.0% among Iranian university and high-school students with higher rates among university and male students, in the similar study span for the current study.

We found that in Iran, 1.3% of the male general population and 2 per 1000 of the female general population used cannabis in the last 12-month. The overall prevalence is around 0.8% for the general population of the country. These estimates are based on the most recent national surveys conducted in 2011 and 2015. The pattern of cannabis use among sex subgroups is similar to other illicit substances in the Iranian population. The prevalence of cannabis use in the general population is lower than the prevalence of soft opioid use (such as opium at 4.4%) and higher than hard opioids (such as heroin at 0.4%) or stimulants (at less than 0.5%) [106, 107].

The United Nation Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that the last 12-month prevalence of cannabis use in the general population aged 15–64 was about 3.9% in 2019 globally [1], five times higher than in Iran. Notably, the prevalence of cannabis use in Iran is lower than the other countries in the region such as Pakistan (3.6%) [108], Egypt (6.2%) [2], Tunisia (2.6%) [2], and Afghanistan (current cannabis use: 3.8%) [109]. The estimates of last 12-month use are also higher in India (3.0%) [110], in African countries (6.4%) [110], in the European Union countries (7.4%) [111], and in Australia (10.4%) [112], making cannabis the most prevalent substance used in many of these countries. The annual prevalence of cannabis use is much higher in Uruguay (15.0%) [113], Canada (15.0%) [114], and the USA (15.9%) [115] where the use of cannabis is partially legalized.

After pooling data for the combined youth groups, we found higher 12-month prevalence estimates for the most recent period (2016–2020)– 4.9% among males, 0.3% among females, and 2.6% in the total combined youth group. Based on the latest national census in Iran, we estimate that 745,000 Iranians aged 15–34 years use cannabis annually. These estimates are higher than the general population prevalence estimates. A similar age pattern in the prevalence of cannabis use has been noted in other countries [111, 114, 115]. Furthermore, the female to male ratio among Iranian youth in the 2016–2020 period was higher than the earliest period (1/16 vs. 1/23), suggesting the increasing popularity of cannabis use among young Iranian females. However, female to male ratio among Iranian youth is still much lower than in European Union countries (1/2) [111] and the USA (1/1.2) [115].

Similar to the general population estimates, the prevalence of cannabis use among Iranian youth (2.6%) is lower than youths in many other countries. The last year prevalence of cannabis use in most of the European Union countries is approximately 20% among the population aged 15–24 years, which is almost five times higher than the prevalence of use of other illicit drugs combined and also higher than the prevalence in the 15-64-year-old general population (7.4%) [111]. The 12-month prevalence estimates are similarly high among youth in other industrialized countries: e.g., 19% among 15–19 years old and 33% among 20–24 years old Canadians [114], and 34.8% among 18–25 years old in the USA [115]. Limited data is available on cannabis use among the young population of Eastern Mediterranean region countries.

The data on the prevalence of cannabis use disorder is consistent with international data in showing a lower prevalence in Iran compared to other countries. According to the latest national survey, 0.5% of the Iranian general population aged 15–64 met the criteria for cannabis use disorder in the last 12-month [21]. While higher than the global estimate of the prevalence of cannabis use disorder (0.3%) [116], the rate in Iran is less than many other countries, including the US, European countries and India [111, 115, 117]. This pattern is also reflected in treatment-seeking for cannabis use disorder. A total of 3.6% and 10.9% of all clients seeking treatment for substance use disorder in two different provinces in Iran, sought treatment for cannabis use disorder. The majority was male (95%) with a mean age of 36 years. The pattern is somehow different from industrialized countries, where a higher percentage of cannabis use disorder is seen among those admitted for drug abuse treatment, with a younger age at admission and a larger proportion of females [111, 118].

We found an increasing trend of last 12-month cannabis use among male youth between 2000 and 2020. No significant trends were found among female youth. However, we found some evidence on an increase in cannabis use among female university students. Furthermore, there was significant increasing trend among youths (the majority being university students) in Tehran province in male and female subgroups. The observed increases are in line with the significant rise of national cannabis seizures. The amount of total cannabis seizures has increased significantly from 1990 to 2018 in Iran. Resin constituted the main form of seizures. There were reported of cannabis plant seizures only in the years 2000, and 2007 to 2011, constituting less than 20% of the total annual cannabis seizure in these years. The cannabis seized in Iran has been reported to be imported from Afghanistan and Pakistan, making Iran a transit country for cannabis. It has been reported that only 20% of the cannabis entering Iran was for domestic use, 65% destined for the Arabian Peninsula and 15% destined for Caucasus [1]. Cannabis resin seized in Afghanistan and Pakistan as two of the main cannabis resin producing countries has also been increasing for more than two decades [14]. There are no precise data on the extent of cannabis cultivation inside Iran, although there are reports of discovery and destruction of indoor and outdoor grown plants and farms.

The observed trend in Iran may also be linked to the legalization of medicinal and recreational use of cannabis in several countries [119]. While cannabis is categorized as a controlled substance (Schedules I) internationally, some countries have changed or are perusing change in the level of cannabis control and related legislations [6, 120–122]. According to drug control law in Iran, the use of cannabis is illegal and cannabis is categorized in the same control level as opium, but lower than heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Nevertheless, learning about the highly publicized changes in cannabis policy in the USA and other countries may have impacted attitudes of the Iranian youth toward harms associated with cannabis use [6]. The growing global prevalence of cannabis use in the last two decades [1] in conjunction with the legalization trends in several industrialized countries has raised concerns about exposure of youth to the potentially harmful effects of cannabis [1, 122, 123].

Cannabis use, especially frequent use might be associated with various short-term and long-term health outcomes [5, 6, 123, 124]. Cannabis use disorder is one of the main associated harms [5], which itself is a strong predictor of negative health outcomes [125]. Chronic psychotic disorders and depression in individuals with predisposing factors have been linked to cannabis use with a dose-response relationship [126, 127]. Early and regular use of cannabis impairs the development of the brain and negatively affect the educational outcomes [5]. Furthermore, cannabis use impairs driving skills and result in a modest increase in the risk of car accident [128–130]. Health consequences of cannabis use in Iran have not been extensively assessed. There are some reports on cases of cannabis-related poisoning cases referred to hospitals in different provinces in Iran, accounting for 1% to 2% of all admitted drug poisoning cases [131–133], including unintentional pediatric poisoning cases [134]. It can be anticipated that with the increase in cannabis use, especially in youth, the adverse health effects might arise. Although the precise effects of the changes in cannabis demand and supply on public health remain unexplored, education of the public, health experts, and policymakers on the cannabis adverse health outcomes and the possible negative effect of cannabis is important [123].

Limitations

In interpreting the study results, several limitations should be considered. First, we did not find recent studies among the general population which provided data on the main indicators of cannabis use in the last 5 years. Furthermore, because of the inadequate number of studies in each period, the trend plot was not presented for the general population. Due to the same limitation, studies conducted among the young general population, university students, and high school students were merged to form a combined youth group for the trend analysis. Second, although some of the studies did not report whether daily or almost daily use indicator was in the lifetime, last 12-month or last month, we decided to pool them into a “daily use in the last month or current”, due to small numbers of studies. Furthermore, we pooled data on last month use with current use due to the scarcity of studies reporting these measures. Third, there were no separate prevalence data for the combined youth group for 25 out of 31 provinces of the country to investigate the possible differences in various regions and the trend in other provinces other than Tehran. Fourth, it should be noted that the estimates might be under-reported as cannabis use is illegal. Also, recall bias would affect the estimated prevalence. Fifth, due to the high heterogeneity, the results should be interpreted with caution. Sixth, further studies are required to better elucidate the extent of cannabis use disorder and treatment seeking in the country. Finally, due to multiple sources approached for accessing all possible relevant studies, we could not track the numbers in the stages of the screening process for the 50 studies in the opportunistic methods.

Conclusion

In the context of the limitations noted above, this study provides the first overview of cannabis use and use disorder prevalence in the country. The prevalence of cannabis use in Iran appears to be lower than the prevalence in many other countries. However, along with the increase in cannabis seizures, there is strong evidence of an increase in cannabis use among the youth. Moreover, there is some evidence of an increase in cannabis use disorder. There is a need to monitor cannabis use and the perception of associated risks in the national population and various subgroups, especially among the youth. Moreover, preventive and educational programs in schools and out of schools are needed.

5. Review Comments to the Author

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: Methods

- Please provide the list of reviewers in the “Eligibility criteria and screening” section (page 4).

- FigureS1; there were 307 excluded papers (=88%). That is the big number. Thus, the authors should provide the reasons (e.g., not quantitative empirical, no specific effect measure, not primary outcome of interest, or no full text) and also how many papers in each reason.

Results

- Table 1: typo error “Mostly 21-0 years” – Damari, 2020

- Fig S1-S11, the authors did the subgroup analysis, including by gender (male/female), frequency (lifetime, 12-mo, last month,…), university student, et al. However, high heterogeneity has still been found. Testing cause of heterogeneity according to the variation of quality of included studies should be concerned in this study.

- The effect of spatiotemporal (i.e., place and time) will affect the pooled prevalence during 1990 to 2021. Table 5 can explain the temporal effect, but not for spatial effect. In my point of view, the subgroup analysis by regions should be done in this study.

- The authors tried to analyze the pooled prevalence during 1990 to 2021. In fact, the prevalence has been changed year by year. Thus, subgroup analysis by study year might be provide some information to the authors.

Reviewer #2: Dear authors,

A similar systematic review was published by Nazarzadeh et al., (2015). Prevalence of Cannabis Lifetime Use in Iranian High School and College Students: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analyses, and Meta-Regression. DOI: 10.1177/1557988314546667. In my opinion, it would be useful to comment on the added value of this review and to compare your results with the results of the mentioned review that searched for references between 1979 and 2014. Please find below my suggestions to increase the accuracy of reporting. In my opinion, a re-categorization of the used groups and including cannabis use/dependence/cannabis use disorders as a separate outcome could increase the value of the manuscript.

Introduction:

• Line 33-Please clarify the statement “However, there is anecdotal evidence that cannabis use is increasing in the country and is becoming an important public health problem”

• Lines 36-38- Youth is generally (e.g., by the United Nations) defined as 15-24 years and include high school and many university students. Therefore, it would be useful to revisit the three mentioned categories: youth, high-school students, and university students.

• The authors did not provide the rationale neither for studying the prevalence of cannabis use in high risk groups nor for national seizures.

Methods:

• Please specify if the systematic review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) or another repository

• Lines 42- On the world scene, the landscape has significantly changed in the last 2 decades with the legalization and decriminalization of cannabis use. Therefore, it would be useful to provide a rationale for including in the search references starting 1990.

• I recommend that the authors provide their research question(s)

• According to the PRISMA guidelines, it is highly recommended (and necessary) to provide the study eligibility criteria in PICO format. A clear definition of the outcome appears only in the results section, i.e., the authors combined use prevalence with cannabis abuse/dependence/cannabis use disorder (CUD). In my opinion, an important (secondary) outcome would be the prevalence of cannabis abuse/dependence/CUD among cannabis users in general and among frequent users.

• The selected quality appraisal tool is adequate for observational studies of prevalence. The authors mentioned that they included studies of any methodology and design; in my opinion, it would be useful to report how the quality of intervention studies was appraised. If intervention studies were not included, this should be stated in the eligibility criteria

• One of the outcomes of interest was cannabis abuse/dependence/CUD. It would be important that the authors provide additional details on how this outcome was operationalised and how many of the included studies met criterion 6 of the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tool “Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition?”

• Line 57, please include the initials of the persons involved in the screening of references and the initials of the person who mediated disagreements

• Lines 60-64, the authors mention that data related to prevalence use was extracted. I am unsure whether this includes cannabis abuse

• Line 71- studies who reported result separate by gender were included in the meta-analyses. What happened with studies who did not report separately by sex or gender? Was this an exclusion criterion?

• Line 73, 80, I recommend that the authors provide a clear definition of the population subgroups; they used a mix of age and education status (students) e.g., what is the difference between young general population and general population? I suggest using groups based on relevant age-ranges (e.g., youth) as a primary outcome and high-risk groups (considering the relative low number of studies, the categories could be collapsed) as a secondary outcome.

• Lines 74-75 Additional details related to frequency of use are needed e.g., how is “currently the main drug” indicative of the frequency of use; what is included in last month or current?

• Line 83: Please explain the meaning of “network scale-up method”

• Lines 87-89, If not enough data was available for some periods, I suggest collapsing categories e.g., 2000-2010. As no rationale was provided for selecting the 5-year time intervals, using 10-years intervals could be a viable alternative. Why was the interval 1990-2000 not used? The same observation applies to the prevalence of cannabis use.

• Lines 95-97, presenting data on national seizure of cannabis is interesting but it is not part of the main objectives, not sure why it was mentioned in the abstract

• Line 98, please provide the name of the package used in R for meta-analyses

Results

• It is common practice to provide the PRISMA flow diagram in the main manuscript (not as an appendix). How can authors explain that more than half (50 out of 90) of included studies were identified by using additional resources (e.g., contacting experts). I recommend that for these additional studies, the authors report how many were initially recommended/identified and how many were excluded at each stage of reference screening (i.e., title and abstract and full text screening stages). I recommend that the authors report the proportion of published studies out of these 50 additional references and the results of quality appraisal.

• I recommend that the authors re-organize their results based on previously suggested grouping (age categories and risk groups)

• I suggest that the authors use sex instead of gender, unless the authors of the included studies clearly reported gender identity

Discussion

• Lines 298-305. In my opinion, it is relevant to contrast the cannabis use prevalence (based on age groups) in Iran with other countries. As previously suggested, a re-grouping of results based on relevant age-ranges could enable better comparisons with the prevalence in other countries/geographical areas.

• Lines 306-315. Discussing the prevalence of cannabis abuse/dependence/CUD is also relevant. Unfortunately, the authors have not focused on this outcome in their analyses. This could be an added value of the present review as this outcome was not included in the review published by Nazarzadeh et al. referenced above.

• Lines 316-325- Comparing the cannabis use trend with national seizures is an interesting topic. I recommend that authors provide in this paragraph the results of additional analyses conducted on this topic and not in the results section (and abstract).

• Limitations: 1) the authors should acknowledge that participants could have under-reported cannabis use as its consumption is illegal in Iran; 2) The heterogeneity was high, and results should be interpreted with caution

We added the criteria each study applied for CUD in the relative tables. Also, the eligibility criteria and data extraction sections were edited accordingly.

 

Reviewer #1

Methods

1) Please provide the list of reviewers in the “Eligibility criteria and screening” section (page 4).

Amended.

2) FigureS1; there were 307 excluded papers (=88%). That is the big number. Thus, the authors should provide the reasons (e.g., not quantitative empirical, no specific effect measure, not primary outcome of interest, or no full text) and also how many papers in each reason.

We applied a wide search strategy. Also, to avoid missing any relevant data, we have screened the full text of studies regarding substance use in Iran even if the relevant cannabis measures were not reported in the title/abstract. Therefore, the number of articles excluded in the stage of full-text review is high.

We added the numbers of studies for each reason of exclusion in the Flow-diagram. We noted that 58 studies should have been excluded in the title/abstract stage and not the full-text review stage; therefore, we corrected the numbers accordingly. Due to the large number, we did not add the exclusion table, which we can provide if needed.

Results

3) Table 1: typo error “Mostly 21-0 years” – Damari, 2020.

Edited.

4) Fig S1-S11, the authors did the subgroup analysis, including by gender (male/female), frequency (lifetime, 12-mo, last month …), university student, etc. However, high heterogeneity has still been found. Testing cause of heterogeneity according to the variation of quality of included studies should be concerned in this study.

We had conducted a heterogeneity study for the total included studies (Result, Heterogeneity study section). The number of unfulfilled quality criteria showed no significant association with cannabis use prevalence (S3 Table). We added this issue (the high heterogeneity) in the limitation section.

We had also performed a sensitivity analysis for those studies with three or more unfulfilled quality items out of the nine. There were only six with three unfulfilled items and no study with >3 unfulfilled. The results of the sensitivity analysis for relative subgroups had been presented in the Result, Quality assessment section.

5) The effect of spatiotemporal (i.e., place and time) will affect the pooled prevalence during 1990 to 2021. Table 5 can explain the temporal effect, but not for spatial effect. In my point of view, the subgroup analysis by regions should be done in this study.

The number of studies conducted among the general population was not enough, neither for temporal nor for regional subgroup analysis.

For the studies conducted among the "combined youth groups", we had performed subgroup analysis based on the geographical regions in the Result, Geographical distribution section. As it is evident in the maps (S11 Fig), no data were available at the province level for 25 provinces. Therefore, there are not enough data for adding the regional subgroups to the current temporal analysis. We stated this shortcoming in the Limitation section.

There was an adequate number of studies only for the Tehran province (eight and nine studies in the male and female subgroups, respectively; mostly were among the university students). Therefore, we added the trend analysis for these studies (Result, Trend section, last paragraph). The method and discussion sections were edited accordingly.

6) The authors tried to analyze the pooled prevalence during 1990 to 2021. In fact, the prevalence has been changed year by year. Thus, subgroup analysis by study year might be provide some information to the authors.

To overcome the limitation that stated in this important comment, we have sub-grouped the included studies by the study year to 5-year time intervals with details (Table 5). Furthermore, we presented all of the forest plots sorted by the study year in each subgroup. Also, in the Abstract and the Discussion, we highlighted only the latest pooled estimates for better interpretation of the current situation in Iran.  

Reviewer #2

Dear authors,

A similar systematic review was published by Nazarzadeh et al., (2015). Prevalence of Cannabis Lifetime Use in Iranian High School and College Students: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analyses, and Meta-Regression. DOI: 10.1177/1557988314546667. In my opinion, it would be useful to comment on the added value of this review and to compare your results with the results of the mentioned review that searched for references between 1979 and 2014.

Amended in the Discussion, first paragraph.

Please find below my suggestions to increase the accuracy of reporting. In my opinion, a re-categorization of the used groups and including cannabis use/dependence/cannabis use disorders as a separate outcome could increase the value of the manuscript.

Introduction

1) Line 33-Please clarify the statement “However, there is anecdotal evidence that cannabis use is increasing in the country and is becoming an important public health problem”.

We changed the wording of this sentence.

2) Lines 36-38- Youth is generally (e.g., by the United Nations) defined as 15-24 years and include high school and many university students. Therefore, it would be useful to revisit the three mentioned categories: youth, high-school students, and university students.

Many thanks for this important comment. We did not pre-defined the age limit before study implementation. After the final inclusion, if not reported in the full text, we requested authors of studies among the general population for the age-specific data. Finally, due to high heterogeneity in the presented age groups, we defined the age limit for the young general population subgroup in such a way not to miss any data (15-34 years). Although, as you have stated, youth is generally defined as 15-24 years, some important reports have used other categories as well. Please see:

• Young adults as 15-34 years in "European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (2019), European Drug Report 2019: Trends and Developments, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg."

• Young people as aged under 30 years in "Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2017. National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016: detailed findings. Drug Statistics series no. 31. Cat. no. PHE 214. Canberra: AIHW."

A notable proportion of adolescents drop out of high school in Iran. Similarly, a large group of youths does not enter university in Iran. As a result, we think these subgroups of high school students and university students are essentially different and we cannot generalize the results of high-school/university students to population groups of the same age. Therefore, in order not to miss any information and as the number of studies in these two subgroups were not low (33 studies among university students and 18 studies among high school students), we preferred to present and analyze these subgroups separately in the text, tables, and relative forest plots.

However, for assessing the trend of the prevalence of cannabis use, we had to merge the "university students" and "high-school students" subgroups with the "young general population". To distinguish this merged group, we used the word "combined" youth group.

We added a few sentences in the Methods, Data extraction and quality assessment section, for the description of the subgroups.

3) The authors did not provide the rationale neither for studying the prevalence of cannabis use in high risk groups nor for national seizures.

In this systematic review, we aimed not to miss any data regarding the use and use disorder of cannabis in Iran. Therefore, we included the pattern and prevalence of cannabis use among PWUD in addition to treatment-seeking for CUD among PWUD due to the important implications.

The data regarding national seizures are also provided for better interpretation of the trend of cannabis use and use disorder prevalence. As properly commented in comment No. 26, we have omitted the seizures-related statements from the Result section and Abstract and confined them to the Discussion section.

Methods

4) Please specify if the systematic review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) or another repository.

This study was not pre-registered, and we added this in the uploaded PRISMA checklist.

5) Lines 42- On the world scene, the landscape has significantly changed in the last 2 decades with the legalization and decriminalization of cannabis use. Therefore, it would be useful to provide a rationale for including in the search references starting 1990.

Amended.

6) I recommend that the authors provide their research question(s).

We have provided the aim of the study in more detail in the Introduction (paragraph 3).

7) a) According to the PRISMA guidelines, it is highly recommended (and necessary) to provide the study eligibility criteria in PICO format. A clear definition of the outcome appears only in the results section, b) i.e., the authors combined use prevalence with cannabis abuse/dependence/cannabis use disorder (CUD). c) In my opinion, an important (secondary) outcome would be the prevalence of cannabis abuse/dependence/CUD among cannabis users in general and among frequent users.

a) We added the research questions (according to comment No.6) in more detail in the Introduction section, paragraph 3. We did not re-state the PICO in the method section to avoid repetition.

b) We have not merged the data regarding the prevalence of use with data on cannabis use disorder. The Result section is categorized based on the target population (general population, young general population, university students, high school students, high-risk population). In each section, we separately described and presented studies on "cannabis use" and "cannabis use disorder". According to this important comment and as stated above, we have changed the paragraphing of the result section slightly and added a few sentences to increase the clarity.

c) Four studies are providing the prevalence of cannabis use disorder included in our study as the following:

Amin-Esmaeili, 2016 Use more than 5 times in the last 12 months: 0.9% CUD: 0.5%

Ahmadi, 2003 Lifetime: 6.3% CUD: 2.5%

Yasamy, 2002 Current use: 0.7% CUD: 0.0%

Ahmadi, 2004 Lifetime: 0.2% CUD: 0.0%

As it is apparent, there is low number of cannabis users or the rate of CUD being 0, the secondary analysis of CUD among cannabis users would be misleading. Therefore, we preferred not to report this estimate.

8) The selected quality appraisal tool is adequate for observational studies of prevalence. The authors mentioned that they included studies of any methodology and design; in my opinion, it would be useful to report how the quality of intervention studies was appraised. If intervention studies were not included, this should be stated in the eligibility criteria.

Interventional studies were excluded. The exclusion criteria was completed.

9) One of the outcomes of interest was cannabis abuse/dependence/CUD. It would be important that the authors provide additional details on how this outcome was operationalized and how many of the included studies met criterion 6 of the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tool “Were valid methods used for the identification of the condition?”

We included any study providing data regarding cannabis use disorder using any diagnostic criteria or definition, and we added the definition/criteria of each study in the relative tables. The unmet unfulfilled quality items are presented in all tables for each study.

10) Line 57, please include the initials of the persons involved in the screening of references and the initials of the person who mediated disagreements.

Done.

11) Lines 60-64, the authors mention that data related to prevalence use was extracted. I am unsure whether this includes cannabis abuse.

We aimed to include any data regarding any use of cannabis and cannabis use disorder. The sentence was edited.

12) Line 71- studies who reported result separate by gender were included in the meta-analyses. What happened with studies who did not report separately by sex or gender? Was this an exclusion criterion?

They were only presented in the relative tables and reported in the text and as we stated in the result section. "Studies not reporting sex-specific data were not included in the meta-analysis." We moved this sentence to the Method section, as noted in this comment for higher clarity.

13) Line 73, 80, I recommend that the authors provide a clear definition of the population subgroups; they used a mix of age and education status (students) e.g., what is the difference between young general population and general population? I suggest using groups based on relevant age-ranges (e.g., youth) as a primary outcome and high-risk groups (considering the relative low number of studies, the categories could be collapsed) as a secondary outcome.

As stated earlier, as the studies among university and high school students are essentially different in Iran, we decided to present these studies separately.

Regarding the age groups among the general population, the age group-specific data was only available for some studies. Even after requesting the authors for further data and analysis, the resultant age groups were very heterogeneous. Therefore, we created a separate group (young general population) with a wide age definition of 15-34 years, which was not pre-defined.

For trend analysis, in order to have an adequate number of studies in each time interval and for assessment of geographical distribution, we merged all studies conducted among university and high school students with the young general population to form a "combined youth group".

We added a few sentences in the Methods for description of the subgroups.

14) Lines 74-75 Additional details related to frequency of use are needed e.g., how is “currently the main drug” indicative of the frequency of use; what is included in last month or current?

The four national situation assessment surveys among the PWUD have reported the prevalence of "currently the main drug of use" for various substances; the cannabis data has been presented in this study (Result, High-risk groups, People who use drugs). It is mainly a measure of cannabis use disorder. We changed this section slightly for clarity.

We pooled data on last month use with current use due to the scarcity of studies reporting these measures (Limitations section), and reported this measure as "last month or current use" prevalence.

15) Line 83: Please explain the meaning of “network scale-up method”.

We added a citation to the description of network scale-up method.

16) Lines 87-89, If not enough data was available for some periods, I suggest collapsing categories e.g., 2000-2010. As no rationale was provided for selecting the 5-year time intervals, using 10-years intervals could be a viable alternative. Why was the interval 1990-2000 not used? The same observation applies to the prevalence of cannabis use.

Regarding the studies among the general population, as only two studies were reporting the prevalence of last 12-month use (in 2011 and 2015), we were not able to provide trend analysis with any time interval.

Regarding the studies among the "combined youth groups", we have chosen the smallest possible time interval for the trend analysis with an adequate number of studies in each period. Moreover, the studies conducted before 2000 did not provide sex-specific data; therefore were not entered into the analyses. Thus, with a 10-year interval, we would not be able to analyze the trend. We highlighted this issue in the Method section.

17) Lines 95-97, presenting data on national seizure of cannabis is interesting but it is not part of the main objectives, not sure why it was mentioned in the abstract.

We omitted seizures' related sentence from the Result section of the abstract.

18) Line 98, please provide the name of the package used in R for meta-analyses.

Added.

Results

19.a) It is common practice to provide the PRISMA flow diagram in the main manuscript (not as an appendix).

Done.

19.b) How can authors explain that more than half (50 out of 90) of included studies were identified by using additional resources (e.g., contacting experts). I recommend that for these additional studies, the authors report how many were initially recommended/identified and how many were excluded at each stage of reference screening (i.e., title and abstract and full text screening stages).

Unfortunately, we had not recorded the number of studies we found through additional sources. However, we provided more details on which sources we used for our opportunistic methods for higher transparency in the Methods, Search strategy section.

The underlying reason for the high number of studies included by opportunistic methods are the followings:

1) Many important and large-scale studies in the addiction field are supported by the Drug Control Headquarters of Iran. The results of these studies are not required to be published in peer-reviewed journals and are accessible as reports.

2) The Iranian database does not cover all Iranian journals. Also, there are some limitations with Boolean operators in this database, limiting the extent of our search. Therefore we overcame this limitation through contact with experts and backward citation tracking.

19.c) I recommend that the authors report the proportion of published studies out of these 50 additional references and the results of quality appraisal.

Added in the Results, first paragraph.

20) I recommend that the authors re-organize their results based on previously suggested grouping (age categories and risk groups).

Stated earlier in comments No. 2 and No. 13.

21) I suggest that the authors use sex instead of gender, unless the authors of the included studies clearly reported gender identity.

Amended.

¬Discussion

22) Lines 298-305. In my opinion, it is relevant to contrast the cannabis use prevalence (based on age groups) in Iran with other countries. As previously suggested, a re-grouping of results based on relevant age-ranges could enable better comparisons with the prevalence in other countries/geographical areas.

We have responded to this important comment on the re-grouping of the age groups in comments No.2 and No.13. We have compared our findings among the youth with the European countries, the USA, and Canada in the Discussion, paragraph 5.

23) Lines 306-315. Discussing the prevalence of cannabis abuse/dependence/CUD is also relevant. Unfortunately, the authors have not focused on this outcome in their analyses. This could be an added value of the present review as this outcome was not included in the review published by Nazarzadeh et al. referenced above.

We presented these important findings in the result section and discussed them in the Discussion, although we could not perform secondary analyses. As only three studies among the general population provided the prevalence of CUD with different study years, we confined to present the data without further analysis. Two of these studies were nationally conducted in 2001 and 2011, and "The prevalence of cannabis use disorder in national studies rose from 0% in 2001 to 0.5% in 2011." Similarly, there was only one study among the high-school students and none among the young general population and the university students on CUD. There were only two studies providing data regarding treatment-seeking for CUD, not enough for further analysis.

We compared our results with the global estimate and some examples of the US, European countries, and India in the Discussion (paragraph 3). We also added that this is the first review including studies on CUD in Iran in the Discussion (first paragraph).

24) Lines 316-325- Comparing the cannabis use trend with national seizures is an interesting topic. I recommend that authors provide in this paragraph the results of additional analyses conducted on this topic and not in the results section (and abstract).

Amended.

25) Limitations: 1) the authors should acknowledge that participants could have under-reported cannabis use as its consumption is illegal in Iran; 2) the heterogeneity was high, and results should be interpreted with caution.

Amended.

26) Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?

Reviewer #2: No

All of the underlying data for this review are presented in the tables (in the main text) and all the forest plots are provided as supporting information.

Reviewer #1: (No Response)

Reviewer #2: Dear authors,

Thank you for addressing my previous comments and for providing clarifications. I appreciate your effort in synthesizing data and providing a comprehensive and up-to-date review of cannabis use in Iran. I provided additional suggestions that could increase the value of the manuscript. I encourage the authors to properly acknowledge the contribution of the work of Nazarzadeh et al., considering the paucity of reviews related to cannabis use in Iran and to pay more attention to how the methodology is reported e.g., lack of research questions, incomplete eligibility and exclusion criteria. I am well aware of the challenges associated with conducting and publishing systematic reviews and I hope that the authors will consider the suggestions provided below.

In my original report, I suggested that the authors remove from the abstract/results the analyses related to national cannabis seizures as this is not an objective of the review and keep this topic for the discussion section. The authors responded, “We omitted seizures' related sentence from the Result section of the abstract” but I am unsure why they kept following statement in the abstract “Trends of various use indicators and national seizures were examined.”

In the abstract, following statement comes out of the blue: “Treatment seeking for cannabis use disorder among those with substance use disorder attending treatment ranged from 0.9% to 10.9%”

In the introduction, the authors inaccurately state “Several studies have examined the prevalence of cannabis use along with other drugs in the general population; however, we know little about the prevalence of cannabis use in different Iranian population subgroups.” In my opinion, the authors should adequately acknowledge in the introduction and discussion sections the systematic review published by Nazarzadeh et al., (2015). Prevalence of Cannabis Lifetime Use in Iranian High School and College Students: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analyses, and Meta-Regression. DOI: 10.1177/1557988314546667. In this review, the authors provide more data related to cannabis use/dependence (by including more groups such as general population, high-risk populations) compared to the review conducted by Nazardeh et al. Consequently, I encourage the authors to elaborate on similarities and differences such as the number of studies retained (and number of participants) in the university and high-school groups, lifetime cannabis use, etc.

In my opinion, the authors should provide a clear description of the eligibility criteria. I recommend that the authors provide in a dedicated paragraph (and not in the data extraction section) a clear description of the population of interest (e.g., what “general population means” ) and of the outcomes. The authors provided in the PRISMA flow diagram exclusion criteria such as “non eligible source population” but this source population was not defined in the eligibility criteria section.

It is important that the authors clearly define what was included in the Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) outcome. The CUD diagnostic criteria were introduced in DSM-5 (2013) and between 2000-2013 the DSM-4 used the terminology “cannabis dependence” and “Cannabis abuse”. Therefore, using CUD for studies conducted before 2013 is misleading and it would be adequate to define this outcome as cannabis dependence/abuse. In some sections (introduction, discussion) the authors refer to cannabis use disorder, in other sections (e.g., high risk groups) to cannabis dependence.

The authors provided in their response the rationale for reporting results based on different population groups i.e., differences between students and other youth. I encourage that the authors explain in the manuscript the rationale for selecting these groups. I am unsure whether the decision to analyze these groups was made before starting the systematic review (as suggested by the study aims provided in the introduction) or at the analysis phase.

The authors excluded from analyses studies that did not report cannabis use separately for men and women, but this is not stated as an exclusion criterion in the PRISMA flow diagram. Therefore, it is difficult for the reader to figure out how many studies were excluded based on this criterion.

To my understanding the population groups used are mutually exclusive e.g., general population, university students, etc. The sum of studies reported in tables 1 to 4 is 102 and does not correspond to the number of studies included in the review based on the PRISMA diagram (90 studies).

The authors acknowledged in their response that they did not keep track of the screening process for the 50 studies identified outside of the international databases search. I appreciate their efforts to identify as many eligible studies as possible, but this process lacks transparency and impedes on the reproducibility of the review. Therefore, I consider that this should be acknowledged as a limitation especially because more than half of the total number of included studies were found using this method.

As previously suggested, it would be useful for readers that the authors provide the name of the R package used for analyzing data. The authors (based on my previous suggestion) provided the name of the functions but omitted the name of the package.

As suggested in my report, it would be useful to provide a short description of the “network scale-up (NSU) method” since the authors excluded NSU studies from the analyses and to provide the number of studies that were excluded based on this criterion.

Reviewer #2:

Dear authors,

Thank you for addressing my previous comments and for providing clarifications. I appreciate your effort in synthesizing data and providing a comprehensive and up-to-date review of cannabis use in Iran. I provided additional suggestions that could increase the value of the manuscript. I encourage the authors to properly acknowledge the contribution of the work of Nazarzadeh et al., considering the paucity of reviews related to cannabis use in Iran and to pay more attention to how the methodology is reported e.g., lack of research questions, incomplete eligibility and exclusion criteria. I am well aware of the challenges associated with conducting and publishing systematic reviews and I hope that the authors will consider the suggestions provided below.

Many thanks for the comprehensive review and insightful comments. Certainly, they would significantly improve this study. We have applied and responded to all the comments:

1) In my original report, I suggested that the authors remove from the abstract/results the analyses related to national cannabis seizures as this is not an objective of the review and keep this topic for the discussion section. The authors responded, “We omitted seizures' related sentence from the Result section of the abstract” but I am unsure why they kept following statement in the abstract “Trends of various use indicators and national seizures were examined.”

We omitted this statement from the Abstract.

2) In the abstract, following statement comes out of the blue: “Treatment seeking for cannabis use disorder among those w¬ith substance use disorder attending treatment ranged from 0.9% to 10.9%”.

We omitted this sentence from the Abstract.

3) In the introduction, the authors inaccurately state “Several studies have examined the prevalence of cannabis use along with other drugs in the general population; however, we know little about the prevalence of cannabis use in different Iranian population subgroups.” In my opinion, the authors should adequately acknowledge in the introduction and discussion sections the systematic review published by Nazarzadeh et al., (2015). Prevalence of Cannabis Lifetime Use in Iranian High School and College Students: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analyses, and Meta-Regression. DOI: 10.1177/1557988314546667. In this review, the authors provide more data related to cannabis use/dependence (by including more groups such as general population, high-risk populations) compared to the review conducted by Nazardeh et al. Consequently, I encourage the authors to elaborate on similarities and differences such as the number of studies retained (and number of participants) in the university and high-school groups, lifetime cannabis use, etc.

The relevant section in the Introduction was edited accordingly, pointing to the differences in the scope of the two studies. Moreover, the result of the previous study was added in more detail in the Discussion section.

4) In my opinion, the authors should provide a clear description of the eligibility criteria. I recommend that the authors provide in a dedicated paragraph (and not in the data extraction section) a clear description of the population of interest (e.g., what “general population means”) and of the outcomes. The authors provided in the PRISMA flow diagram exclusion criteria such as “non-eligible source population” but this source population was not defined in the eligibility criteria section.

We moved the mentioned sentences to the "Eligibility criteria and screening" section as a separate paragraph and extended the details on the definition of the target population. The "non-eligible source population" was added to the eligibility criteria.

5) It is important that the authors clearly define what was included in the Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) outcome. The CUD diagnostic criteria were introduced in DSM-5 (2013) and between 2000-2013 the DSM-4 used the terminology “cannabis dependence” and “Cannabis abuse”. Therefore, using CUD for studies conducted before 2013 is misleading and it would be adequate to define this outcome as cannabis dependence/abuse. In some sections (introduction, discussion) the authors refer to cannabis use disorder, in other sections (e.g., high risk groups) to cannabis dependence.

The relevant sentence in the Method section was clarified as below:

"Whatever criteria of the cannabis use disorder, either based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version IV or V or any other definitions, the studies were included. The applied criteria were reported precisely as stated in the study."

We stated whatever terminology the studies applied in the result section and relative tables; however, in the Introduction and Discussion sections we used "cannabis use disorder", to be consistent with the latest DSM-V.

6) The authors provided in their response the rationale for reporting results based on different population groups i.e., differences between students and other youth. I encourage that the authors explain in the manuscript the rationale for selecting these groups. I am unsure whether the decision to analyze these groups was made before starting the systematic review (as suggested by the study aims provided in the introduction) or at the analysis phase.

Based on the previous reviews conducted by our center, studies investigating the prevalence of substance use are mainly conducted among the general population, university students, high school students, or high-risk subgroups in Iran. Therefore, we selected the target population accordingly. This rationale was added to the Method section.

7) The authors excluded from analyses studies that did not report cannabis use separately for men and women, but this is not stated as an exclusion criterion in the PRISMA flow diagram. Therefore, it is difficult for the reader to figure out how many studies were excluded based on this criterion.

As these studies were not excluded from the systematic review and were presented in the tables, we did not add this criterion to the eligibility criteria. However, we added the number of studies excluded from the meta-analysis to the Result section.

8) To my understanding the population groups used are mutually exclusive e.g., general population, university students, etc. The sum of studies reported in tables 1 to 4 is 102 and does not correspond to the number of studies included in the review based on the PRISMA diagram (90 studies).

This is since there are "Four studies provided measures for both the general population and young general population." Also, we have presented the results of four different provinces and rounds of the Persian Youth Cohort study (six rows for one study) and the result of one repeated cross-sectional study among university students (four rows for one study) separately in the relative tables. This would add up to 102 rows for 90 studies. We added two clarifying sentences regarding the latter issue in the Result section.

9) The authors acknowledged in their response that they did not keep track of the screening process for the 50 studies identified outside of the international databases search. I appreciate their efforts to identify as many eligible studies as possible, but this process lacks transparency and impedes on the reproducibility of the review. Therefore, I consider that this should be acknowledged as a limitation especially because more than half of the total number of included studies were found using this method.

Was added in the Limitation section.

10) As previously suggested, it would be useful for readers that the authors provide the name of the R package used for analyzing data. The authors (based on my previous suggestion) provided the name of the functions but omitted the name of the package.

The name of the packages was added.

11) As suggested in my report, it would be useful to provide a short description of the “network scale-up (NSU) method” since the authors excluded NSU studies from the analyses and to provide the number of studies that were excluded based on this criterion.

A brief definition was added in the Method section. The number of studies excluded accordingly was added in the Result section.
