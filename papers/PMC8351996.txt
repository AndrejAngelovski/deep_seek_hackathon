Evolutionary forces like Hill-Robertson interference and negative epistasis can lead to deleterious mutations being found on distinct haplotypes. However, the extent to which these forces depend on the selection and dominance coefficients of deleterious mutations and shape genome-wide patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in natural populations with complex demographic histories has not been tested. In this study, we first used forward-in-time simulations to predict how negative selection impacts LD. Under models where deleterious mutations have additive effects on fitness, deleterious variants less than 10 kb apart tend to be carried on different haplotypes relative to pairs of synonymous SNPs. In contrast, for recessive mutations, there is no consistent ordering of how selection coefficients affect LD decay, due to the complex interplay of different evolutionary effects. We then examined empirical data of modern humans from the 1000 Genomes Project. LD between derived alleles at nonsynonymous SNPs is lower compared to pairs of derived synonymous variants, suggesting that nonsynonymous derived alleles tend to occur on different haplotypes more than synonymous variants. This result holds when controlling for potential confounding factors by matching SNPs for frequency in the sample (allele count), physical distance, magnitude of background selection, and genetic distance between pairs of variants. Lastly, we introduce a new statistic HR(j) which allows us to detect interference using unphased genotypes. Application of this approach to high-coverage human genome sequences confirms our finding that nonsynonymous derived alleles tend to be located on different haplotypes more often than are synonymous derived alleles. Our findings suggest that interference may play a pervasive role in shaping patterns of LD between deleterious variants in the human genome, and consequently influences genome-wide patterns of LD.

Author summary

Many mutations in genomes are deleterious, decreasing fitness in carriers. Popular methods to quantify deleterious mutations model mutations independently while ignoring the correlations between nearby variants. Theory predicts that a deleterious mutation can influence the frequency change of variants located nearby along the genome. Here we use simulations under population genetic models with parameters relevant to humans to show that pairs of deleterious mutations located near each other in the genome tend to have different correlations between them as compared to pairs of neutrally evolving SNPs. Specifically, if an individual carries the deleterious allele at one variant, that individual is less likely to carry the deleterious allele at a nearby variant. We then searched for these patterns in both low and high-coverage human genetic variation datasets from multiple populations. We found that pairs of deleterious alleles tend to be found in different individuals more frequently than are pairs of neutrally evolving variants at the same frequency, even after controlling for confounding factors. Our results suggest that the interference between deleterious alleles is common across the human genome, which has implications for inferring demographic history, natural selection, and associating variants with complex traits.

Introduction

The non-random association of alleles at different loci is often referred to as linkage disequilibrium (LD). The magnitude of LD between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is shaped by both population processes, such as demographic history, and intrinsic cellular factors, like recombination and gene conversion [1–4]. If two variants are in linkage disequilibrium, they can either be in positive LD or negative LD. Positive LD occurs when derived alleles appear on the same haplotype more often than expected under independence (i.e. linkage equilibrium) and negative LD occurs when derived alleles appear on the same haplotype less often than expected under linkage equilibrium. Previous studies have used LD to estimate demographic parameters of populations such as the historical effective population size (Ne) and divergence times between populations [2,5,6]. Additionally, methods have been developed to estimate recombination rates from patterns of LD [7–11]. Most of the previous work on modeling patterns of LD has relied on assumptions about selective neutrality among markers, though some work quantified the effects of positive selection on LD [12–16].

Negative selection can influence patterns of LD in two ways: negative synergistic epistasis and Hill-Robertson Interference (HRI). Negative synergistic epistasis occurs when haplotypes carrying multiple deleterious mutations are less fit than predicted by their marginal fitness [17]. This leads to negative selection efficiently removing haplotypes containing multiple deleterious alleles. The remaining deleterious alleles are more likely to segregate on distinct haplotypes compared to neutral mutations, leading to negative LD [18]. Further, as individuals carrying many deleterious mutations are efficiently removed from the population, this synergistic epistasis leads to the distribution of deleterious mutations per genome being underdispersed [19,20]. Sohail et al. showed that rare loss-of-function alleles are underdispersed in human and Drosophila genomes [18], suggesting that polymorphisms currently segregating in human and Drosophila populations are not only experiencing negative selection, but are also non-independently affecting fitness.

A second way in which negative selection can impact LD is through Hill-Robertson interference (HRI) [21]. This scenario occurs when deleterious alleles are not efficiently removed from the population by negative selection and can increase in frequency due to drift. Here, one deleterious variant inhibits or accelerates the removal of a cosegregating deleterious variant. [22]. When LD is positive, haplotypes carrying multiple deleterious variants are more effectively removed from this population than haplotypes containing only one deleterious variant because such haplotypes have the lowest fitness. In other words, positive LD between deleterious variants increases the rate at which the population responds to selection as the variance in fitness among individuals is greatest [22]. If, however, deleterious mutations occur on different haplotypes in a population, then the variance in fitness across haplotypes is reduced, as they all carry a similar number of deleterious alleles [23,24]. Consequently, selection becomes less efficient at removing haplotypes carrying one deleterious allele. In finite populations not in mutation-selection balance and experiencing drift, interference predicts pairs of deleterious SNPs will exhibit negative LD (relative to pairs of variants not under selection), especially when they are separated by small physical and genetic distances [25–27]. In our study, an excess of negative LD means the same thing as seeing fewer pairs of variants in positive LD, which shows that variants are less likely to occur on the same haplotype than expected under independence. Importantly, population genetic models without drift do not predict an excess of negative LD. Specifically, by considering Fisher’s fundamental theorem, as long as selection is able to efficiently remove load and Muller’s ratchet is operating slowly compared to the timescale of coalescence, excess negative LD is not expected as a result of linked selection [23]. For instance, a population with a single non-recombining chromosome with deleterious mutations that are removed at the same rate at which they are created (in mutation-selection balance), does not experience interference [23,28].

Hill and Robertson first studied the effect of linkage disequilibrium on natural selection with only two additive loci under natural selection [21]. They reported that interference creates a detectable excess of negative LD with biologically relevant effective population sizes and variants with realistic selection coefficients. However, their simulations and theory did not incorporate new mutations or multiple loci that differed in age and distance from focal mutations. Adding to their work, McVean and Charlesworth [25] studied the effects of Hill-Robertson interference between weakly selected mutations. They simulated multiple weakly selected mutations and observed that weak selection Hill-Robertson interference generates negative LD between beneficial mutations. This excess of negative LD was most apparent among alleles that were physically close to each other and appeared to disappear with increasing distance between markers. They suggested that interference is a prevalent force driving the distribution of biased codon usage in Drosophila. Although they looked at the effects of interference caused by negative selection on fixation probabilities, heterozygosity, and average time to loss, they did not examine the impact of interference among deleterious sites on LD. Additionally, Comeron and Kreitman showed via simulations that interference among multiple positively selected variants should create an excess of negative LD among low frequency variants while reducing overall levels of neutral polymorphism [26]. However, these simulation studies considered only populations of constant size, and their applicability to the LD patterns of natural populations with more complex demographic histories and multiple sites under negative selection remains understudied. Indeed, recent work has found that the expected pattern of background selection is heavily affected by the demographic history of the population [29,30].

Preceding this work, Comeron et al. hypothesized that interference could influence the spatial distribution of putatively beneficial codons [31]. Using forward simulations and biologically relevant recombination rates, Comeron et al. proposed that a multi-site model of a finite population, with mutations, selection, and linkage could predict the observed relationship between the magnitude of codon usage bias and coding sequence length observed in natural Drosophila populations. Recent literature on Hill-Robertson interference proposes mechanistically why and when Hill-Robertson interference causes negative LD, both in cases of positive selection in asexually evolving populations [24] and negative selection in asexually evolving and recombining populations [23]. In these works, the authors study how the variance in fitness within “effectively asexual linkage blocks” is important when interference is prevalent.

The role of interference has also been assessed in primates (human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque) by quantifying the relationship between recombination and dN/dS [32]. Bullaughey et al. [32] suggested that there is no detectable effect of recombination on rates of protein evolution. Later, Hussin et al. [33] looked for signatures of interference by quantifying the relative enrichment of deleterious mutations in cold spots of recombination. Theory suggests that cold spots of recombination should be enriched with slightly deleterious mutations relative to hotspots of recombination [34,35]. They identified this relative enrichment in exons, though the strength varied across populations. Additionally, they observed that conserved exons in recombination cold spots are enriched with haplotypes with two NS variants relative to exonic haplotypes in hotspots of recombination. Hussin et al. concluded this excess of mutational burden in cold spots would be expected under a process similar to Muller’s ratchet [34]. Here, the least-loaded haplotype class cannot be quickly regenerated if recombination is scarce because it is degraded by drift or new mutations. These results suggested that interference might play a significant role in determining patterns of genetic diversity in human autosomes. Although this study examined the effects of negative selection on the distribution of burden and enrichment of deleterious variation across haplotypes and recombination rates in the human genome, it did not explicitly study the effect of negative selection on LD summary statistics (r2, D, D’).

In the present study, we first examined how negative selection affects levels of LD among deleterious nonsynonymous (NS) SNPs relative to the LD among neutral synonymous (S) SNPs using forward simulations. Although all summary statistics of LD depend on allele frequency, we controlled for this possible confounder in our comparisons by limiting pairwise LD calculations using the method of frequency matching described by Eberle et al. [36]. We found in forward simulations with a human-oriented recombination rate, mutation rate, and distribution of fitness effects of new mutations, that negative selection induces a detectable excess of negative LD among derived alleles. Next, we used human data from the Phase 3 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) [37] and tested for a difference in LD patterns between NS and S SNPs. We found that pairs of derived NS variants tend to be located on different haplotypes (i.e. have more negative LD between them) compared to matched pairs of derived S variants. Additionally, to replicate our results, and to provide a method to detect interference in unphased data sets, we introduce a new summary statistic HR(j). Using this statistic, we demonstrate signatures of interference in the New York Genome Center’s (NYGC) unphased high coverage resequencing of 1KGP individuals [38]. Our findings of an excess of negative LD between pairs of putatively deleterious variants suggest that interference might play a pervasive role in shaping patterns of LD between proximal NS variants in the human genome.

Results

Forward simulations

We performed forward simulations using SLiM 3.0 [39]. Each generated chromosome was approximately 5 Mb long and contained intergenic, intronic, and exonic regions. Only NS mutations within exonic regions experienced negative selection (see Materials and Methods). In our simulations, for every 1 synonymous (S) mutation, there are 2.31 NS mutations. This value is derived from degeneracy of the codon table of eukaryotes [40]. We refer to mutations as NS and S throughout this study because these terms refer to the precise types of mutation analyzed in empirical data. We simulated under three demographic models (S1 Fig). Model 1 consists of a population of 10,000 individuals evolving for 100,000 generations. Model 2 is the model of human demography by Gravel et al. [41] and implemented into SLiM [39]. Model 3 is identical to Model 2 except that there is no migration across the populations. For each simulation replicate, we sampled 50 individuals from the African population and computed the various LD statistics as described in Materials and Methods.

Predicted effect of negative selection on LD between pairs doubletons

We first used our simulations to investigate the effect of negative selection on patterns of LD. It is well-known that LD summary statistics are influenced by allele frequency [3,36]. Therefore, we controlled for this effect in the simulations by only considering pairs of SNPs with the same allele frequency in the sample. Further, we only calculated LD statistics between pairs of SNPs with the same functional annotation. For example, we computed LD only between pairs of NS SNPs or between pairs of S SNPs. See S1 Text and S2 Fig for further simulation results considering other LD statistics and other variant frequencies.

We begin by focusing on doubletons (derived variants that show up in our sample of 50 diploid individuals twice, or variants with a frequency in our sample of 2/100) because we hypothesized that doubletons would be enriched with polymorphisms that are more strongly influenced by negative selection relative to higher frequency variants [42–44]. Consistent with this hypothesis, simulations under Model 1 with a gamma distributed DFE (see Materials and Methods) show that deleterious NS variants with a frequency greater than 2/100 in a sample of 50 individuals tend to be less deleterious than doubletons (S3 Fig). Additionally, relative to singletons, we expect doubletons to be less influenced by sequencing error or errors in variant calling in empirical data. From a theoretical perspective, studying doubletons is advantageous because they are the most prevalent type of variants after singletons under the standard neutral model [45]. We quantify LD between derived doubletons using D’ rather than r2 because the sign of D’ is informative regarding whether the derived alleles preferentially occur on the same haplotypes (are in coupling, also called positive LD) or different haplotypes (are in repulsion, also called negative LD) (see S4 Fig). If a pair of doubletons only occur on the same haplotype in our sample of 100 chromosomes, they will have a D’ value of 1. Pairs of derived doubletons that never occur on the same haplotype in our sample have a D’ value of -1. Thus, the average value of D’ at a given distance reflects the number of pairs of SNPs that occur on the same haplotype (more positive) or on different haplotypes (more negative).

We found that D’ between doubletons located within 10kb of each other is greatly affected by negative selection (Fig 1). When assuming additive effects on fitness, D’ for weakly and moderately deleterious (s = -0.0001, s = -0.001, s = -0.01) variants is lower than those for neutral doubletons, indicating that deleterious doubletons (s<0) tend to occur on different haplotypes more often than SNPs that are neutral in these simulations (dark blue curve in Fig 1). Similar trends are seen when computing other summary statistics of LD (e.g. r2, see S5 Fig).

10.1371/journal.pgen.1009676.g001 Fig 1 Mean D’ for simulated NS doubletons within 10kb from each other across different recombination and dominance parameters.

The differences in the decay curves are most apparent for recombination rate r = 1 x 10−9 per bp and depend on the dominance coefficient of mutations (h) and the selection coefficient (s) of NS mutations. 150 simulation replicates were simulated for each scenario and were split into 3 groups consisting of 50 simulations. For each group, the mean value of D’ is shown as the line and the error bars denote the minimum and maximum mean D’ values.

For recessive variants, pairs of moderately deleterious (s = -0.01) doubletons also tend to have lower values of D’ than pairs of neutral doubletons, when recombination rates are low (r<1 × 10-8 per bp). However, weakly deleterious SNPs (s = -0.0001 and s = -0.001) have mean values of D’ that are greater than those values for neutral SNPs (Fig 1). These patterns did not appear to hold across all recombination rates like in the additive case, though the magnitude of the difference is greatest in simulations with low recombination rates. The behavior of recessive deleterious mutations is due to the complex interplay of HRI effects combined with a heterosis effect (associative overdominance) whereby recessive deleterious mutations are masked from selection in the heterozygous state [46]. This effect may be exaggerated if there is little recombination and the deleterious alleles arise on the same haplotype, leading to positive LD.

In real genomes, putatively neutral S and intronic variants are interspersed with deleterious NS mutations. We next compared LD patterns between pairs of NS SNPs (with s = -0.0001) to the LD patterns of pairs of neutral S SNPs (no effect on fitness) in our simulations. Consistent with our previous simulations, pairs of derived NS doubleton SNPs (blue line) have less positive LD than pairs of derived S doubletons (yellow line) (S6 Fig). This finding suggests that NS doubletons are located on different haplotypes more often than are S doubletons.

As the degree of LD between a pair of doubletons also is influenced by the amount of recombination that occurs between them, we wanted to ensure that the results shown above were not driven by different amounts of recombination occurring between pairs of NS SNPs and pairs of S SNPs. To test for this, we simulated 50 replicates under neutrality but with the same distribution of exons and introns described earlier. We simulated NS SNPs without negative selection by simulating mutations with a NS mutation rate, but with s = 0. In summary, the LD patterns for the pairs of NS SNPs without negative selection (red line) matches the LD patterns of pairs of S SNPs (yellow and purple line) (S6 Fig), suggesting that the distribution of functional elements is not responsible for the differences in LD patterns between deleterious NS SNPs and interspersed neutral SNPs in simulations.

We also simulated under a more complex demography, Model 2, and found similar trends as the constant size population (see S2 Text and S7–S9 Figs). Both the simulations with constant selection coefficients for all NS mutations as well as simulations with selection coefficients from a gamma distributed DFE predict deleterious doubletons should have lower values of mean D’ relative to neutral doubletons.

To examine how LD among variants at other allele frequency categories may be impacted by negative selection, we simulated 3,000 replicates of Model 1 with a recombination rate of 1 x 10−8 crossovers per base pair per generation, and then computed frequency matched LD statistics (S1 Table). Under the assumed simulation parameters, our simulations predict that after deleterious variants increase above a frequency of 6%, they will no longer have lower D’ values than neutral alleles.

A new statistic to quantify the effect of selection on the distribution of unphased 2-locus genotypes (HR(j))

The standard LD statistics r2, D, and D’ are based on the frequency of haplotypes that contain both derived alleles at both loci (pAB), which require phased haplotype information. Often when studying nonmodel organisms or unprocessed genotype data, we typically do not have this information and would have to rely on computational phasing. The performance of computational methods to impute or phase variants becomes more challenging for rare variants [47,48], which are the focus of our study. Further, when studying sites influenced directly by natural selection, the assumption of HWE may be violated and the correlation between the diploid allele counts (as denoted by {0,1, or 2}) may not equal the correlation between the haplotypes for two markers.

Here we introduce new statistics that can be directly computed from diploid genotype data to quantify whether derived alleles are more likely to be coupled (i.e. on the same haplotype) or in repulsion (i.e. on different haplotypes) for different functional annotations. Consider a pair of singleton variants. An individual can be homozygous ancestral (0/0,0/0) at both variants, heterozygous at one SNP (0/1,0/0 or 0/0,0/1), or doubly heterozygous (0/1,0/1). If an individual is heterozygous at only one of the SNPs, then by definition, the two singletons must be on different haplotypes. If an individual is heterozygous for both SNPs, it is possible that both derived alleles are carried on the same haplotype. Alternatively, if an individual is heterozygous for both SNPs, it is possible that both derived alleles are carried on different haplotypes (see S4 Fig). Quantifying the distribution of homozygous ancestral, singly heterozygous, and doubly heterozygous genotypes does not require information about haplotype phase and thus can be applied to genotype data. We formalize this idea in a statistic that we call HR(j) (see Materials and Methods for a more detailed description and how to compute HR(j); also see S10 Fig). Our statistic can be calculated from pairs of derived variants at different frequencies in a sample. Applying this statistic to only doubletons in a sample of 50 diploid individuals, corresponding to variants with frequency of 2/100, we call it HR(2). HR(1) is used when we compute the statistic on singletons in the sample. Essentially, HR(j) counts the average number of individuals heterozygous at both SNPs for pairs of SNPs at a given distance apart from each other. This statistic was created to measure the amount of repulsion in a sample, and that is what the subscript “R” stands for. As it is uncommon for doubletons in a sample of 50 to be found in a homozygous state, they are not counted in HR(j), with little loss of information. Based on predictions from our simulations using other LD statistics (D, D’, r2), we hypothesized HR(j) to be lower for deleterious SNPs than for neutral SNPs. To test this hypothesis and examine the behavior of the HR(j) statistic, we simulated under Model 2 across two different recombination rates (r = 1 x 10−9 per bp and r = 1 x 10−8 per bp). Our simulations show that unphased genotypes and therefore HR(2) are affected by negative selection. Specifically, for both recombination rates (Fig 2), there is a depletion in mean HR(2) and HR(1) for pairs of NS variants compared to S variants. Additionally we computed Spearman’s correlation coefficient (⍴) between mean HR(2) and mean D’ as well as mean HR(1) and mean D’ (S11 Fig). In all cases, the HR(j) statistics are highly correlated with D’ (⍴ > 0.945, p-value < 2.2e-16). Thus, we conclude that HR(j) can detect interference between deleterious variants using unphased genotypes.

Forward simulations predict NS pairs of variants have a mean HR(j) that is on average lower than that of S pairs of variants.

Error bars represent one standard error of the mean. 4,300 simulation replicates of Model 2 were simulated for each recombination rate.

Matched-pairs permutation test for differences in LD between NS and S SNPs

To quantify differences in LD while controlling for possible covariates, we developed a matched-pairs permutation test on pairs of SNPs (S12 Fig). Using the R Package "MatchIt" [49], for each pair of NS SNPs, we extracted a pair of S variants with a similar physical distance between variants (bp), the same allele count between pairs, a similar genetic distance (cM), similar mean B-value amongst pairs of variants, and located on the same chromosome as the NS pair. With these matching criteria, we compared pairs of variants that have similar levels of diversity and physical distance between variants. S13 Fig shows how closely we required the pair of S SNPs to match the pair of NS SNPs across these characteristics. We then computed the difference between the LD statistic (we considered several different LD statistics, including D’ as well as our new HR(j) statistic) for the NS pair and the S pair. The mean of these differences across all the matched pairs was then computed and used as the test statistic. A matched-pairs permutation test was then conducted with 10,000 permutations. In each test, the null hypothesis was that the mean difference in LD statistics between pairs of NS and S SNPs was 0. The alternative hypothesis was that the mean difference in LD statistic across pairs was less than 0 (the LD statistic among NS pairs was less than that of the matched S pairs). To evaluate the performance of our matched-pairs permutation test, we simulated genomes under Model 1 with simulations that: 1) included negative selection using the distribution of fitness effects inferred by Kim et. al [40], and 2) did not contain negative selection. While a significantly more negative mean D’ was seen for NS SNPs in simulations with negative selection (p < 0.005; matched pairs permutation test), this significant difference was not seen in simulations without negative selection. Additionally, in the simulations without negative selection, we performed this matched-pairs permutation test on other summary statistics of LD and observed no significant difference between pairs of NS variants and S variants (S14 Fig).

Comparison of LD between NS and S SNPs in human data

We next tested whether negative selection has affected patterns of LD across the human genome. Here we first examined 50 phased diploid genomes from the Yoruba (YRI) population of the 1KGP [37]. We computed D’ for pairs of low-frequency (in this study frequency equal to or less than 5/100, or allele count equal to or less than five) NS variants matched for allele frequency. The same was done with pairs of low frequency S variants. To test for a significant difference in the amount of LD between NS and S SNPs, we used the permutation test described in the previous section where we matched each pair of NS SNPs to a pair of S SNPs that had the same derived allele frequency, physical distance between the pair of SNPs, genetic distance between the pair of SNPs, and magnitude of background selection (See Materials and Methods and S13 Fig).

We observed a difference in the mean D’ of matched pairs of NS and S variants across genetic distance bins (Fig 3A). Specifically, NS SNPs have lower values of D’ at a given distance compared to S SNPs. Application of the matched-pairs permutation test showed that the observed difference of mean D’ between NS and S variants is significant (p < 0.0005) (Fig 3B). These results suggest that pairs of derived alleles at NS SNPs tend to be located on different haplotypes more often than are derived alleles at pairs of S SNPs. Because of our matched-pairs permutation procedure, we conclude the differences in patterns of LD between pairs of NS SNPs was not due to differences in local recombination rates or differences in background selection.

10.1371/journal.pgen.1009676.g003 Fig 3 Pairs of NS variants have lower LD compared to pairs of S variants in human genetic variation data.

(A) Pairs of low-frequency (variants with minor allele count < = 5 in a sample of 50 individuals) NS variants in the YRI population of the 1KGP have a lower (i.e. more negative) mean D’ compared to pairs of S variants across genetic distance bins. Error bars represent one standard error of the mean and were calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the number of pairs of SNPs. (B) In the YRI population of the 1KGP, NS pairs of variants have a significantly lower D’ compared to matched pairs of S variants.

Analysis of additional populations

We next tested for differences in LD patterns between pairs of NS and S variants in other human populations. We selected data from 50 individuals from four other non-African populations included in the 1KGP (Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB), Utah Residents with Northern and Western European Ancestry (CEU), Mexican Ancestry from Los Angeles USA (MXL), Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT)) and performed identical analyses to those described above to quantify the difference in LD between the different types of SNPs. As in the YRI population, we observed that mean D’ between matched pairs of NS SNPs was clearly lower than that for pairs of S SNPs across genetic distance bins in three out of four populations (CHB, MXL, JPT; Fig 4A) and that these differences were statistically significant in three out of four populations using the matched-pairs permutation test (Fig 4B). In the CEU, D’ was more negative for pairs of NS variants (-0.7806) compared to pairs of S variants (-0.7722), though the difference was not significant. These findings illustrate that across several human populations, NS derived alleles tend to co-occur on different haplotypes more frequently than do S variants that have the same frequency.

(A) Across four other populations in the 1KGP, NS pairs of variants have lower values of D’ (i.e. have more negative LD) than their matched S counterparts. The quantile bins on the x-axis were set by combining all pairs of variants across all populations and assigning them into 5 bins based on the centimorgan distance between variants with roughly equal numbers of pairs in each bin. Thus, each population has the same centimorgan distance used to define each bin. (B) Matched-pairs permutation test shows significantly more negative average LD between pairs of NS SNPs than S SNPs in all populations except the CEU population, where this difference is not significant.

Replication in high-coverage sequence data

Our previous analyses used 1KGP Phase 3 data which is the product of genotype imputation and statistical phasing. To mitigate the possible effects of imputation and haplotype phasing errors on our analysis, we also examined the distribution of NS and S variants using unphased genotypes and our new HR(2) and HR(1) statistics to test for differences in LD between NS and S variants. In addition to using the 1KGP Phase 3 dataset, we also used the 30X WGS of the 1000 Genome Project samples, sequenced by the New York Genome Center and funded by NHGRI (http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20190425_NYGC_GATK/) [38].

Our simulations predict that HR(2) and HR(1) ought to be lower for pairs of NS variants compared to pairs of S variants (Fig 2). In the 1KGP Phase 3 YRI data, on average, pairs of NS variants have a lower mean HR(2) and HR(1) (Fig 5A and 5B) compared to S variants. This difference is statistically significant for both doubletons (observed difference = -0.017, permutation test p = 0.011) and singletons (observed difference = -0.006, permutation test p = 0.001). Importantly, the 30X WGS of the same 1000 Genome samples sequenced to higher coverage by the New York Genome Center replicates this result (Fig 5C and 5D). In this data set, the observed difference in mean HR(2) for NS and S variants is -0.065 (p = 0.0088), and the observed difference in mean HR(1) is -0.018 (p = 0.001). Thus, our finding that NS SNPs tend to be located on different haplotypes more often than S SNPs is robust to the specific dataset used and is not due to phasing and imputation errors in the original 1KGP Phase 3 data.

Can Hill-Robertson effects account for more negative LD between NS SNPs?

We hypothesize that Hill-Robertson effects are more likely to impact pairs of variants close to each other, whereas other forces, like synergistic epistasis act on pairs of variants further apart [18]. To better compare the difference between NS and S SNPs as a function of distance, we normalized the difference in D between NS and S pairs of SNPs by dividing by the mean D of S SNPs (Fig 6). Overall, this statistic is negative in the empirical data across the entire range of genetic distances considered (green line in Fig 6). Simulations under Model 2 show a similar pattern, except that the normalized D tends toward 0 with increasing genetic distance between SNPs. To assess whether the difference between the simulations and empirical data could be due to the fact that the empirical data has fewer pairs of SNPs (6,066) than do the simulations, we resampled 6,066 pairs from the simulations with the same allele frequencies as those in the empirical data. Here, the normalized difference in LD calculated from the empirical data falls within the range of values seen in the simulations. Some of the non-monotonic trends observed in our analysis of empirical data may also be due to the limited number of SNP pairs in particular recombination rate bins leading to imprecise measurements of the mean D. Fig 6 shows how downsampling the simulation replicates to have the same number of SNP pairs as do the empirical data (3,160 pairs of NS SNPs and 2,906 pairs of S SNPs) induces fairly high variance, consistent with the empirical observations. Thus, simulations including negative selection can recapitulate the difference in LD between NS and S SNPs at different intervals of genetic distance. We also examined the relationship of mean normalized difference in D in CEU and CHB and observed a similar relationship with genetic distance (S15 Fig).

10.1371/journal.pgen.1009676.g006 Fig 6 Mean normalized difference in D across genetic distance quantiles.

Empirical (green) and simulated data shows a deficit in D between NS variants. The lighter orange lines show 100 resamples of the simulated data. Each resample of the simulated data has the same number of variants with the same allele count as the empirical data.

Since our forward simulations consisted of mutations that only affect fitness multiplicatively across loci, we conclude that the excess of negative LD between NS SNPs can be explained by interference. However, as a limitation of our study, since we did not explicitly test for it, we cannot rule out a contribution from negative synergistic epistasis in the empirical data (see Discussion).

Discussion

Here we have shown that patterns of LD are influenced by deleterious mutations, in addition to recombination and the underlying demographic history of a population. In our simulations, we show how Hill-Robertson interference is expected to influence LD patterns between deleterious mutations and find that the effects are likely to be stronger in regions of lower recombination (Figs 1 and S2), consistent with previous work [25,33,50]. Using a human demographic model and DFE, our simulations suggest that interference should be detectable in both low recombination regions (r = 1 x 10−9 per bp) and regions with an average recombination rate (r = 1 x 10−8 per bp) in the human genome (Figs 1 and S2). We then searched for these patterns in several genomic datasets from several human populations and with different types of data (low-coverage and exome sequence data followed by imputation as well as high-coverage whole-genome sequence data). To quantify the difference in LD among NS variants relative to S variants, we implemented a matched-pairs permutation test. Overall, for most of the comparisons considered, NS SNPs appear to be present on different haplotypes more frequently than S SNPs having the same allele frequency (Figs 3, 4 and 5).

Recent studies have identified batch effects present in the 1KGP that have led to population-specific artifacts [51]. We hypothesized that if the excess of negative LD among pairs of NS variants is due to batch effects, we would not detect this difference across multiple populations. However, we see qualitatively similar patterns in 4 of the 5 populations from the 1KGP. Additionally, previous work has suggested that low-frequency errors that are the consequence of batch effects tend to be in positive LD with each other (i.e. the erroneously called derived alleles at different loci tend to co-occur in the same individual) [52]. Also, variants that are identified as error candidates are more likely to be NS variants [52]. With this in mind, we suspect that sequencing errors would bias our analysis of pairs of low frequency variants annotated as being NS towards being more often in positive LD than in negative LD. This suggests that our observation of a depletion of positive LD amongst NS variants is conservative. Lastly, the fact that we replicate these findings using unphased genotypes for HR(2) and HR(1) from high coverage sequencing (Fig 5) suggests our conclusions are not due to artifacts in the 1KGP.

While we use simulations to quantify the effects of interference on LD statistics, a limitation of this study is that we do not simulate full human genomes and directly assess whether the model parameters can fully explain the empirical data. The DFE that we simulated under closely recapitulates empirically observed site frequency spectrum in human genetic variation data [40]. However, for tractability, we did not incorporate empirically measured recombination maps into our simulations, and instead simulated under uniform recombination rates. Because of this, the LD decay curves in our sample may not quantitatively match the curves seen in empirical data. With these limitations in mind, we compared trends from these simulations qualitatively to our empirical data. Future work can test whether realistic genetic maps, functional annotations, and a DFE can match genome-wide patterns of LD. We focused on variants with minor allele count less than five because in our sample size of 50 they are affected by selection (S3 Fig). In many modern datasets, sample sizes are much larger and have many more than 50 individuals. In such datasets singletons and doubletons can be at very low population allele frequencies. In these datasets it may be better to focus on other allele frequency categories for detecting HRI.

Our work adds to the growing literature indicating Hill-Robertson interference is a non-negligible force involved in the spatial distribution of NS variation in the human genome. Sohail et al. [18] found that putatively deleterious loss of function mutations were under-dispersed compared to putatively neutral S variation. Their summary statistic essentially quantified an increase in negative LD between loss of function variants. Their work is similar to our finding of an excess of negative LD among NS variants compared to S variants. However, because the variants they examined were predominantly on different chromosomes and not physically linked, Sohail et al. mainly attributed this excess of negative LD as a signature of synergistic epistasis among deleterious variants. Hussin et al. [33] looked for signatures of interference by quantifying the relative enrichment of deleterious mutations in cold spots of recombination. Our simulations are concordant with this finding and predict that differences in LD among deleterious variants will be most distinguishable in regions of low recombination (r = 1 x 10−9 per bp) and almost indistinguishable in regions of high recombination (r = 1 x 10−6 per bp) (Fig 1).

Our results suggest that inferences of demography that depend on genome-wide LD patterns may be biased if negative selection is not accurately modeled. For example, Tenesa et al. used r2 at different genetic distances to infer changes in population size and fit exponential functions to LD decay to infer admixture times [6]. If variants under negative selection are included in these analyses, they may bias parameter estimates. Further, demographic models fit to the site frequency spectrum in humans and Drosophila do not recapitulate empirically observed LD patterns [53–55]. Unmodeled negative selection may contribute to this lack of fit. We recommend carefully filtering regions of the genome that may be affected indirectly (linked selection, interference, background selection) or directly by selection by removing loci that have a short recombination distance to functionally annotated loci [56,57]. Alternatively, when considering variants under selection, we find that different combinations of recombination rate, DFE, and dominance predict unique mean r2 and D decay patterns. Thus, LD patterns may offer a strategy to infer the relationship between the dominance coefficient and the DFE in outcrossing populations [58]. In order to accurately predict the expected LD decay curve under a given scenario, extensive forward simulations, or recently developed numerical approaches [59], are needed to determine the predicted LD decay as a function of these genomic and selective parameters.

Further, through methods like LD score regression, LD patterns have been used to learn about the architecture of complex traits [60]. We have shown that for low-frequency variants, variants under selection will have more negative LD than putatively neutral variants (S1 Table). This effect may bias methods that assume variants of the same allele frequency will have the same distribution of r2 values. For example, stratified LD score regression is used to infer heritability in different functional annotations and assumes that there will be similar LD between causal variants and tag SNPs regardless of the fitness effects of the causal variants [61]. Because causal variants under greater negative selection may have larger effects on the trait [62], the heritability that deleterious variants account for may be systematically underestimated.

Epistatic interactions have been documented between variants in different genes [63] as well as variants within the same gene [64] and are believed to be widespread properties of biological networks [65,66]. Although the genomic consequences of additive deleterious variants which multiplicatively (across loci) affect fitness are extensively studied, pairwise interactions among variants might be a non-negligible force governing molecular evolution. Current methods to identify plausible pairwise interactions between SNPs rely on classic population genetic summary statistics of LD or other summaries of pairwise association frequencies [65,67,68]. Although we detect differences in LD summary statistics in the human genome among variants of different annotations, our simulations suggest this difference can be explained by interference without the need to invoke epistasis (Fig 6). We hypothesize that the difference is predominantly due to interference because of its relationship with recombination rate. Our simulations and theory predict that the biggest differences in LD should be present among variants with the least amount of recombination separating them, and the smallest differences in LD should be present between variants with the most amount of recombination separating them. This scenario aligns with what we observe in our empirical data. We propose that when developing methods for detecting synergistic epistasis, null models should incorporate Hill-Robertson interference.

Future work could quantify the prevalence of epistasis among linked deleterious variants while jointly quantifying the fitness effects of pairs of deleterious variants [59]. Additionally, although it has been shown that two locus statistics such as D’ can be used in the detection of epistatic interactions and interference [17,50], it is possible that a combination of summary statistics can better discern between the two. Machine learning approaches, which can combine different features of genetic variation data [69], may provide a powerful tool for detecting salient spatial features of proximal variants involved in epistatic interactions and interference.

Materials and methods

Forward simulations

We performed forward simulations using SLiM 3.0 [39]. Each generated chromosome was approximately 5 Mb long and contained intergenic, intronic, and exonic regions. Only NS mutations within exonic regions experienced negative selection. The distribution of genomic elements in our forward simulations followed the specification in the SLiM 4.2.2 manual (7.3), which is modeled after the distribution of intron and exon lengths in Deutsch and Long [70]. Within exonic regions, NS and S mutations were set to occur at a ratio of 2.31:1 [71], which is derived from degeneracy of the codon table of eukaryotes. While intergenic deleterious variation exists, our simulations only considered “exonic” variation. For simulations using a DFE, the selection coefficients (s) of NS mutations were drawn from a gamma-distributed DFE with shape parameter 0.186 and expected selection coefficient E[s] = -0.01314833 [40]. All NS mutations were either additive with h = 0.5 or recessive with h = 0.0. The per base pair per generation recombination rate was constant across each simulated region and was fixed at r ∈{10−6, 10−7, 10−8, 10−9} while the per base pair per generation mutation rate was set to μ = 1.5 x 10−8.

We simulated under three demographic models. Model 1 consists of a population of 10,000 individuals evolving for 100,000 generations. Model 2 is the model of human demography by Gravel et al. [41] and implemented into SLiM [39]. Model 3 is identical to Model 2 except that there is no migration across the populations (S1 Fig). We simulated the total number of individuals in the population without additional scaling of parameters with the exception of S14 Fig, where population sizes were scaled to be 10-fold smaller. For each simulation replicate, we sampled 50 individuals from the African population and computed the various LD statistics as described in Materials and Methods. Simulation code is on Github for each model.

Empirical data

We first used data from 50 Yoruba (YRI) individuals from the 1KGP. Specifically, we randomly sampled 50 individuals from Supplementary Table 4 in Gazal et al. [72] that were labeled as coming from the “YRI” population, had a mating type described as “OUT” (outcrossing), and had a Q-score (quality score) of greater than 50. Then we removed all non-biallelic variants. Next, we polarized the remaining variants using only high-confidence sites in the 6-way primate EPO multiple alignment as the ancestral allele. All variants without a high-confidence ancestral allele were also removed from analysis. Remaining biallelic exonic variants in our sample were annotated as either NS or S variants using ANNOVAR [73]. For analyses with other populations of the 1KGP Phase 3 data, the same procedure described above was used.

Analysis of the YRI NYGC 1KGP whole-genome sequence data used the same 50 individuals that were selected from the 1KGP Phase 3 data. Variants were also polarized using only high-confidence sites in the EPO multiple alignment as the ancestral allele. All variants without a high-confidence ancestral allele were also removed from analysis. Remaining biallelic exonic variants in our sample were annotated as either NS or S variants using ANNOVAR [73]. Pairs of variants that were within 10,000 bp of each other, had the same allele count in the sample of 50, had the same annotation, and were both located in the 1KGP strict mask (http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000_genomes_project/working/20160622_genome_mask_GRCh38/StrictMask/20160622.allChr.mask.bed) were then analyzed. The total number of pairs of variants included in each empirical analysis is indicated in S2 Table.

Computing LD summary statistics with frequency matching

Three different pairwise LD statistics were calculated between SNPs with the same allele count in our sample. First, to compute D, we used the formula from Lewontin [17]: D=pAB−pApB.

Here, D is the difference between the observed frequency of haplotype AB (pAB) and the expected frequency of haplotype AB (assuming random association of the alleles at the two loci, pA*pB). In this calculation, pA and pB are the observed frequencies of the derived alleles A and B in our sample. With the notation described here, the coupling haplotypes include derived alleles at both variants (AB) and the repulsion haplotypes include derived alleles at one variant (Ab are aB).

We computed r2 with the formula: r2=D2pApapBpb.

D’ was computed with: D′={Dmin(pApB,papb)D<0Dmin(pApb,papB)D>0.

Whether D’ is negative or positive depends on the arbitrary choice of the alleles paired at two loci. We chose the pair of derived alleles to be the pair of alleles that cause D’ > 0 when located in coupling. Therefore, a pair of derived doubletons that only ever appear in a sample together on the same haplotype will have a D’ = 1. A pair of derived doubletons that are never observed on a haplotype together in a sample will have a D’ = -1.

Limiting LD calculations between SNPs to restricted allele frequency intervals was first done by Eberle et al. [36] and found to be a more sensitive measure for assessing the average decay of LD and is able to generate average r2 values across nearly the entire informative range. We applied this approach to pairs of NS SNPs as well as pairs of S SNPs. For plotting smooth LD decay curves (Figs S2, S6, and S7), we used a generalized additive model with the “gam” function from the R package mgcv version 1.8–29 [74]. We fit the default formula y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"). This formula specifies a generalized additive model between LD (y) and physical distance (x) with a penalized cubic regression spline which has had its penalty modified to shrink towards zero (bs = “cs”) [74].

A new LD statistic for unphased genotypes: HR(j)

We developed a new statistic to be applied to unphased genotype data to quantify whether derived deleterious alleles at a pair of SNPs are likely to be found on the same haplotype. We call our new static HR(j), where the “R” stands for “repulsion” as we use this summary statistic to measure repulsion between deleterious variants.

We begin by computing the distribution of counts of homozygous ancestral, singly heterozygous, and doubly heterozygous genotypes amongst pairs of variants that were within 10,000 bp from each other, had an identical allele count, and also had the same functional annotation (S or NS). Here variants can have three genotypes 0 (homozygous ancestral), 1 (heterozygous), 2 (homozygous derived). For example, for a pair of NS singletons in a sample of 50 diploid individuals, the counts could be: n11 = 1, n01 and n10 = 0, and n00 = 49. This would correspond to 1 individual being doubly heterozygous for this pair of variants, 0 individuals being singly heterozygous, and 49 individuals being homozygous for the ancestral genotypes at these loci.

Then, HR(j)=1lj∑i=1i=ljn11(i).

HR(j) depends on three components: n(i)11, j, and lj. j refers to the allele count of variants to be analyzed. For singletons, j = 1, for doubletons j = 2, for tripletons j would be equal to 3, etc. lj is the number of pairs of variants at allele count j within a distance threshold. n(i)11 represents the count of heterozygous individuals with derived variants at both loci of the pairwise comparison i (coding genotypes as 0 for homozygous ancestral, 1 for heterozygous, 2 for homozygous derived). For pairs of doubletons, this equation is represented as: HR(2)=1l2∑i=1i=l2n11(i)

and would be called HR(2). To compute HR(2) for derived NS variants in a sample, we created a list of all derived NS doubletons in the sample. Then, we created a list of all unique pairwise combinations of these doubletons that involve SNPs within a certain distance threshold. The length of this list would be equal to l2. We then found the number of heterozygous individuals with derived variants at both loci of the pairwise comparison i are then summed together over all l2 pairs of SNPs. This is represented by ∑i=1i=l2n11(i). Lastly, division by the total number of pairwise comparisons (or multiplication by 1l2) gives HR(2).

In principle, HR(j) can be computed for any value of j<2n, where n is the number of individuals in the sample. In practice, we consider j = 1 and j = 2 because low-frequency variants in a sample size of 50 are most likely to be impacted by negative selection (S3 Fig).

Estimating genetic distance between variants

The genetic distance between two markers was computed using the high-resolution pedigree-based genetic map assembled by deCODE [75]. First, we averaged the male and female genetic maps. Occasionally the genetic distance between two markers in our sample was not explicitly estimated by deCODE. If one or both of the markers were in regions not measured by deCODE, we removed these markers from our analysis with genetic distance. However, if the two markers were within a region of the genome with a high-resolution recombination environment estimated by deCODE, we imputed the genetic distance between markers by estimating a centimorgan per base pair rate and multiplying this rate by the physical distance between the two markers that lacked a genetic distance annotation.

Annotating variants with amount of background selection

For one of our matched-pairs permutation tests, we matched pairs of NS variants with pairs of S variants with similar levels of background selection. B-values were downloaded from http://www.phrap.org/software_dir/mcvicker_dir/bkgd.tar.gz. Then we used liftOver (UCSC Genome Browser) with its default settings and the hg18Tohg19 chain (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/liftOver/hg18ToHg19.over.chain.gz) to convert B-value coordinates from hg18 to hg19. Each SNP in our data set was then annotated with its corresponding B-value using the GenomicRanges package [76].

S2 Fig Decay of mean r2 for different recombination and dominance parameters.

The differences in the LD decay curves are most apparent with recombination rate r = 1 x 10−9 per bp and depend on the dominance coefficient (h) of mutations and the selection coefficient (s) of NS mutations. DFE curves come from simulated populations where new NS mutations have selection coefficients following our defined distribution of fitness effects (see text). All variants are included in this analysis and no frequency filters are applied.

S3 Fig Doubletons in a sample of 50 individuals are more deleterious than higher frequency variants.

We simulated 300 replicates of a constant population size of 14, 474 diploid individuals with r = 1 x 10−8 per bp, and the DFE and genome structure defined in Materials and Methods. Although simulations predict singletons (first red point), on average, should be the most deleterious in our samples, doubletons (second red point) are also relatively deleterious. Higher frequency variants tend to have mean selection coefficients that are much more neutral. Because we want to study the effects of negative selection on LD, we restrict many of our analyses to low frequency variants (allele count < = 5)

There are two different scenarios shown in the figure: 1) simulations with negative selection, and 2) simulations without negative selection (completely neutral evolution). The blue line is the decay curve of NS doubletons with direct negative selection acting on them. In contrast to the decay curve of the NS doubletons not under negative selection (dark red), the NS doubletons with direct negative selection acting on them (blue) have a more negative D than the other neutral doubletons (S variants in simulations without selection, NS variants in simulations without selection, S variants in simulations with selection).

S7 Fig Decay of D for simulated NS and S doubletons in scenarios with migration.

For r = 1 x 10−8 per bp, the largest differences between S and NS D is predicted by our simulations to be within the 0–10,000 bp range. In our simulations with r = 1 x 10−9 per bp, noticeable differences between S and NS D is predicted by our simulations to be across the 0–100,000 bp range. Additionally, migration appears to qualitatively obscure the difference in D between types of variants at intermediate distances.

S8 Fig Mean selection coefficient of deleterious doubletons in our simulated samples and their population of origin.

For both r = 1 x 10−9 per bp and r = 1 x 10−8 per bp, doubletons that appear in our simulated “African” sample, have on average different mean selection coefficients depending on their population of origin. Migration (Model 2) allows for deleterious variants that originated from other populations to appear in our African samples. On average, the doubletons in our sample of African individuals that originate from East Asia and Europe are less deleterious than the doubletons in our sample that originated from Africa.

S10 Fig Pictorial representation of nAB and HR(1).

The statistic HR(1) depends on the number of unique pairwise comparisons among singletons within the distance threshold 10 kb (l1 = 1). Additionally, it depends on the number of individuals who are heterozygous at both loci. In both Scenario 2 and 3, the individual is heterozygous at both loci, thus making HR(1) = 1. The statistic nAB depends on the number of haplotypes that contain derived alleles at both loci. In this case, only Scenario 2 contains one haplotype that has both derived variants. HR(1) can also be thought of as an indicator variable taking the value of 1 if an individual is heterozygous at both loci and 0 if not.

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Authors:

Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: In this manuscript, Garcia and Lohmueller investigate Hill-Robertson interference, which occurs when deleterious variants with additive effects tend to occupy disjoint haplotypes. Overall, this is a convincing and very thorough paper. A particular strength is the comprehensive and well-written Introduction section. I also appreciated the extensive analyses of genetic data from different populations and different types of sequencing data. My only major comment is that the organization of the Results section could be improved.

Major presentation comment

The structure of the Results section is difficult to follow. Right now, there are many rounds of simulations, comprising more than half the methods section, but after these many subsections there is a one-sentence statement that none of the LD metrics computed in simulations can actually be computed on real data due to lack of phased data (I disagree with this statement; see minor comment 7 below). Then, two new methods are introduced (H_R(j) and a permutation test), and it’s not clear what the relationship is between them (I assume the permutation test is applied to H_R(j), but this isn’t stated). Then, results on real genotypes are presented, and at the same time, new simulations are performed to show that the new methods work.

I suggest the following organization for the results section: (0) optionally, describe a small set of motivating simulations that illustrate the effect that you wish to quantify; (1) describe new methods and why they are needed, including H_R(j) and the permutation test; (2) perform simulations, and devote at least one simulation subsection to demonstrating that the new method/metric performs as intended; (3) apply new method/metric to real genotypes.

Minor comments

1. Figure 1: Is the dependence of LD on bp distance and recombination rate fully mediated by the map distance? I.e. is LD approximately the same at distance=1kb and rate=10^-7 vs d=10kb and r=10^-8? If not, please explain why. If so, consider changing the x axis to map distance and reducing the number of figure panels from 8 to 2. Also, please set the minimum y-axis value to zero on all panels.

2. “no consistent ordering of how selection coefficients affect genome-wide r2 decay with physical distance”: what is the intuition for why this occurs?

3. “Human-like exomes… human-like levels of negative selection”: when model parameters are chosen to match human-inferred values, do resulting observable quantities actually match what we observe in humans? Is the allele frequency spectrum similar? Is the average LD similar?

4. “As the degree of LD between a pair of doubletons also is influenced by the amount of

recombination that occurs between them, it is possible that there could be different genetic distances (cM) between pairs of NS and S SNPs”: I don’t understand this sentence. Should it instead state that different genetic distances between NS vs S SNP pairs could be an alternate explanation for differences in LD?

5. Effect of background selection on LD between S variants: this is interesting, and I think it merits further investigation, but Figure S5 does not convince me that the effect is real. Is the slight difference that is observed at d<500bp statistically significant? Is it explained by differences in allele frequency spectrum? What is the selection coefficient for NS variants in these simulations, and might the effect be stronger under weak selection than under strong selection?

6. Proportion of S vs NS variants with D=-1: this long paragraph doesn’t cite any main or supplementary display items, and it doesn’t seem especially well motivated – given that E(D) is already shown to be different, is there any scenario where P(D=-1) would not be different? Given that P(D=-1) is not quantified in analyses of real data, I think that this subsection could be deleted.

7. “traditional LD statistics… require phased haplotype information”: It’s not clear to me that this is true. Let r_phased be the correlation between the haploid genotypes for two markers, and r_diploid be the correlation between the diploid allele counts. Under Hardy-Weinberg, r_phased=r_diploid. Are potential HWE deviations the reason for needing something more sophisticated? Is observable deviation from HWE even possible for doubletons? Overall, I feel that H_R(j) could be motivated more clearly. (However, this manuscript does not need a nontrivial new statistic to be a valuable contribution).

8. D’ values of S vs NS variants: are the observed values, including the apparently non-monotonic trend, consistent with simulations? Are the S values consistent with neutrality?

9. Figure 4: I suggest to calculate standard errors and include error bars for panel A; to use a linear x-axis scale in panel A with round numbers as x-tick values; to reduce the number of subpanels in B from 3 to 1, as all three subpanels convey the exact same information; and to move panel C content to simulations section.

10. Figure 4b presents traditional LD metrics, seeming to contradict the statement on p. 18 that they cannot be computed on real data due to lack of phased information. Are these calculated using computational phasing? Are there any limitations to this approach (e.g. that it cannot be applied to variants below some MAF threshold)?

Reviewer #2: In their manuscript "Negative linkage disequilibrium between amino acid changing variants reveals interference among deleterious mutations in the human genome" Garcia and Lohmueller examine the signal of LD between deleterious alleles. The study first analyses the expected patterns of LD using forward in time simulations, before studying these patterns in empirical human population data. The study shows that LD between deleterious loci is lower than neutral equivalents, suggesting interference. In addition, the authors introduce a new statistics (H_R) that allows to detect interference in unphased genomic data.

Overall, this is a very well conceived study. In nicely combines intuition building through simulations with empirical analyses. The manuscript is timely, well-written and interesting. Few modifications and additional information would make the manuscript more accessible to a broader audience.

Major comments:

- I find it quite difficult to wrap my head around negative LD when values in the figures (e.g., Fig. 1 and 2) are positive. I think it would increase the accessibility of the manuscript present values of D' instead of r2.

- It would be good to see results of LD for higher frequency alleles. Do they show the same pattern as doubletons, or does it change? Some deleterious alleles might actually be at higher frequencies due to demography or introgression. Would be nice to see if there is a threshold for the observed pattern.

- How is the LD calculation and pattern influenced by the difference in diversity between NS and S loci? Did you compare only pairs with equal physical distance?

- While I think a uniform s is a good start and helps to build intuition about the effect, it would be great to have one or two additional simulations with (e.g., gamma) distributions that would allow to track which combination of effect sizes create the pattern. Or at least explore this further in the DFE simulations. What combinations of s create negative LD and which ones not. This would be useful for the interpretation of empirical data.

- The use of H comes a bit out for the blue for me and could maybe be better integrated into the flow. It would be particularly useful the show correlations of other LD measures with H. The fact that you have phased data should not harm H calculations and how does this compare to unphased results?

- How is the nomenclature for H_R determined? Not sure I like the use of "H" in this context as it is used already extensively (Not that many other letters are being used uniquely). If you want to stick to "H" maybe it would be good to include LD as index instead of R to make clear that it's a measure of LD.

- I was wondering how many sites are actually used for each analysis in the empirical data. Could you maybe include a supplementary table that indicates the number of sites used, im particular for the H_R analysis.

- Does NS and S come from "synonymous" and "non-synonymous"? Does this not unnecessarily narrow the sites. The simulations are not limited to those and in reality other loci might be as deleterious (e.g., promotors). I think it would be clearer to use deleterious and neutral throughout the manuscript. In the empirical part the use of non-synonymous as proxy for deleterious can be specified.

Further comments:

Introduction:

- It would be useful to introduce the concept of negative LD in the introduction

- "... or negative synergistic epistasis play a pervasive role in shaping patterns of LD between proximal NS variants in the human genome." This seems to imply that you tested for negative synergistic epistasis, but this is not the case. I would suggest to rewrite.

Material and methods:

- Would be good to give more details on the simulations in the M&M section. Even if some parameter values (N and generations) are mentioned in the Results, I think it wouldn't harm to have them all together in the M&M section. This will make the workflow more reproducible.

- is there an implementation code for H_R that other people could use on their data? Would be great if you could implement it to work on VCF files for others to test those patterns. I think this would increase the impact of your study substantially.

Figures:

Fig. 1 why do strongly deleterious alleles show higher LD than neutral alleles? if it was only for the lack of interference as described in the "results" would we then not expect the no difference to neutral. But observed is an increase. Can you give further explanations for this increase?

Reviewer #3: In this manuscript, the authors use simulations to study how patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) are affected by negative selection. They show using simulations that deleterious mutations can be brought into negative linkage disequilibrium by the action of linked selection, i.e. even in the absence of epistatic interactions between the mutations. They show that the excess of negative linkage disequilibrium can be maintained in complex demographic models thought to be realistic for humans, and also demonstrate that an excess of negative linkage disequilibrium can be observed in empirical data in the difference in patterns of LD between nonsynonymous and synonymous variants. They highlight that an excess of negative LD due to linked selection can lead to problematic estimates of quantities inferred from genome-wide LD patterns under the assumption that these are not significantly impacted by linked selection. I think this is an important and valuable point, especially given the central role that these methods play in statistical and population genetics.

Overall, I find the manuscript very interesting and the main conclusions convincing. I believe it represents a valuable contribution to the literature, but I have one substantial concern, which is that I don’t believe that the effect that leads to an excess of negative LD has been accurately described and interpreted. Specifically, there is existing theoretical literature on Hill-Robertson interference causing negative LD that explains why and when Hill-Robertson interference causes negative LD, both in cases of positive selection in asexually evolving populations (see Gomez et al. 2019 Genetics) and negative selection in both asexually evolving and recombining populations (see Good et al. 2014 PLoS Genetics). The latter work in particular shows that negative LD may or may not arise in the presence of linked negative selection, depending on how efficient selection is at purging deleterious mutations from the population. It would be important for the text of the manuscript to be revised to accurately reflect this effect (and to acknowledge these earlier authors describing the effect) — I give details in my first major comment.

Major comments:

1) The argument outlined in the paragraph starting on the bottom of page 5 and continuing on page 6 is not entirely accurate. It attributes the entire effect of negative LD to an increase in relative fitness of single mutants due to the presence of multiple mutants. Yet it is not difficult to show that this effect on its own does not lead to an excess of negative LD. Consider for instance a population with a single non-recombining chromosome in mutation-selection balance, in which deleterious mutations are removed at the same rate at which they are created, so that the population is not experiencing Muller’s ratchet. For simplicity, let’s focus on the case that all mutations have the same effect on fitness, -s, though this is not essential to the argument. In this case, at mutation-selection balance, the population assumes a Poisson-shaped fitness distribution with an average uL/s mutations per individual, where u is the per-site mutation rate, and L the number of sites, as described by Haigh (1978) and others. This means that the deleterious mutations are distributed independently, as if they were freely recombining and excess negative LD does not arise in this case. This is in direct contrast to the explanation given by the authors.

By considering Fisher’s fundamental theorem, one can show that as long as selection is able to efficiently remove this load and Muller’s ratchet is operating slowly compared to the timescale of coalescence, excess negative LD is not expected as a result of linked selection. By Fisher’s fundamental theorem, the rate of change in the mean fitness, v is related to the fitness variance sigma^2, mutation rate and selection coefficient s according to: v = sigma^2 - uLs. Here we see that the Poisson case of efficient selection described above corresponds to v = 0 and sigma^2 = u L s, whereas the ratcheting case has v < 0, and so sigma^2 < u L s, and deleterious mutations tend to be in negative LD. This effect persists in the presence of recombination — see Good et al. 2014 PLoS Genetics, and in particular Fig. S1, and the Supplementary Texts.

Note that this rationale also agrees quite well with the simulation results seen here — there is an intermediate strength of selection at which excess negative LD is strongest, which also agrees with expectations of the rate of Muller’s ratchet being maximized at intermediate fitnesses. However, it does suggest that many of the simple arguments offered here do not stand up to scrutiny.

2) The focus on doubletons to quantify the effects of negative selection is not well justified from a theoretical standpoint (though I agree that using doubletons appears generally better than the common practice of using singletons, as the authors explain). Ultimately, the important population-genetic factor is the frequency of an allele in the population, rather than in the sample, and depending on the sample size, doubletons can represent vastly different frequencies. In many modern datasets, singletons and doubletons can be at such low frequencies they are primarily affected by genetic drift for reasonable strengths of selection, which means that the main effect that the researchers aim to study is likely difficult to observe on theoretical grounds, and possibly attributable to other causes. In general, while I do agree with the authors that patterns of LD are strongly influenced by frequency, the choice of target frequency should be guided by theoretical considerations and parameter values, in addition to heuristics for the elimination of technical artifacts in a dataset (which I agree are also very important).

For instance, in some cases examined here — for instance for s = 0.001, N = 10 000, Ns = 10, which means that all variants below a frequency of 1/Ns = 10% are primarily affected by drift. Doubletons in these samples (n= 100) are expected to be present in the population at frequencies 2% or lower, meaning that on their own, they should not be strongly impacted by selection. In fact, for these parameters, we can quite confidently claim that the effects of negative selection should be very weak at the target frequencies if all haplotypes contain no more than two deleterious mutants. Thus, any effect visible at these frequencies must be attributable to statistical features stemming from linkage to (large numbers of) other deleterious mutations, which reinforces the point above that the causes of negative LD are subtler than described here.

To avoid these technical artifacts of sample size, and understand better the frequency-dependence of the effect describes here, would it be feasible to look at these statistics as a function of the entire frequency spectrum and attempt to identify transition points in ways that are self-consistent with the input parameters?

Minor comments:

1) I would argue that the statement that there has been comparatively less empirical work quantifying Hill-Robertson interference as a bit ungenerous — given how broadly the term is applied, one could argue that many papers attempting to quantify the strength of background selection (including some classical ones by Charlesworth et. al, as well as more recent work by e.g. McVicker et al (2009) PLoS Genetics, Elyashiv et al. (2016) PLoS Genetics) are doing precisely that. Perhaps make the statement a bit narrower to clarify?

2) I think it is a great point that unmodeled negative selection may contribute to differences between empirically observed LD patterns and demographic models fit to the site frequency spectrum (page 26, Discussion). However, I disagree with the suggestion that filtering variants that may be affected by selection should be sufficient, unless nearby neutral SNPs are also filtered. As this manuscript (and others) demonstrate, linkage between deleterious variants is critical to producing negative LD, and this form of linkage also affects patterns of variation at neutral sites.

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Authors:

Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: Thank you to the authors for their thorough response - I have no further comments.

Reviewer #2: The authors have made a great effort to address my comments and improved their manuscript.

I have no further comments.

Reviewer #3: The authors have done a commendable job in addressing my concerns, and in my opinion have produced a very interesting piece of work. I would also like to thank them for formatting their revision so clearly and thus making it very easy to follow the changes in the revision process.

I only have two further comments:

1) Figure 2 shows some pretty dramatic non-monotonicity in the mean H_R(1) and H_R(2) statistics in the simulated samples. This highlights a point that (as discussed by the authors with reference to real data) the effect size may be relatively subtle and somewhat noisy. Would it be possible to increase the sample size/number of simulations performed for Figure 2, so that the nonmonotonicity is ultimately averaged out, giving the reader a sense of what can be expected under ideal conditions. It is also good to see the effect of limited sampling (and I very much like how the authors accomplished to show both in Figure 6). I don’t know whether this is computationally feasible at this point, but if at all possible, it would be very scientifically informative.

2) Lines 279, 280: “Our simulations predict that after deleterious variants increase above a  frequency of 6% they will no longer have lower D’ values than neutral alleles.” — I recommend including a brief clause along the lines of “under the assumed simulation parameters” just to emphasize to the reader that this is not an absolute statement about a definitive cutoff in human genomes.
