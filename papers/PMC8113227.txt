Correction to: Translational Psychiatry

10.1038/s41398-021-01358-y published online 24 April 2021

The original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake in the following sentence “These analyses indicate that the Ztbt16-regulated transcriptome is related to both ASD and SCZ”. “Ztbt16” should be changed to “Zbtb16”. We apologize for the error. The original article has been corrected.
