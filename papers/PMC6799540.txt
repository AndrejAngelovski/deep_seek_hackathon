In animal models, these drugs also reduce anxiety and depression. OBJECTIVE—to determine if Veteran Affairs (VA) clinical pharmacy data indicate a protective effect of ARBs and/or ACEIs for major depression. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Pharmacy records from nationwide VA electronic medical records (EMR) were extracted for patients prescribed ARBs, ACEIs, α-blockers, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics (n=4,081,359). Patients were excluded if: they had not received medications for 6 months with >70% coverage; were diagnosed with substance/alcohol abuse, dementia, psychosis, schizophrenia, or prescribed insulin. The study population was categorized as “ARB/ACEI” (A/A) or “Never ARB/ACEI” (NA/A). Using the Greedy Matching Algorithm, subjects were matched on a 1:1 ratio for sex and race over a 5 year age range resulting in 2 equal groups of n=1,350,236 each. Subjects were older (M=71.6, SD=12) and mostly men (97%). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In the A/A Versus NA/A, respectively, the incidence of anti-depressant use was greater during (9.9% vs. 8.9%) but was lower after (11.8% vs. 12.2%) the study period. PHQ-2 scores (Mean±SD) were statistically lower, albeit similar, during (0.79±1.56 vs. 0.85±1.63) and after (1.00±1.73 vs. 1.07±1.79) the study period. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These preliminary data suggest that inhibiting angiotensin II action does not provide a protective effect on major depression when compared with other classes of antihypertensive drugs. This study illustrates how “Big Data” may inform the design, or obviate the need, for large-scale randomized-controlled trials.
