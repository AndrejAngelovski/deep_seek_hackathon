death. Calcium channel antagonists improve outcomes in some clinical conditions,
but mechanisms remain unclear. In 18 healthy participants we: (i) quantified
with multiparametric MRI the effect of hypoxia on the thalamus, a region
particularly sensitive to hypoxia, and on the whole brain in general; (ii)
investigated how calcium channel antagonism with the drug nimodipine affects the
brain response to hypoxia. Hypoxia resulted in a significant decrease in
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), a measure particularly sensitive to cell
swelling, in a widespread network of regions across the brain, and the thalamus
in particular. In hypoxia, nimodipine significantly increased ADC in the same
brain regions, normalizing ADC towards normoxia baseline. There was positive
correlation between blood nimodipine levels and ADC change. In the thalamus,
there was a significant decrease in the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
(ALFF) in resting state functional MRI and an apparent increase of grey matter
volume in hypoxia, with the ALFF partially normalized towards normoxia baseline
with nimodipine. This study provides further evidence that the brain response to
acute hypoxia is mediated by calcium, and importantly that manipulation of
intracellular calcium flux following hypoxia may reduce cerebral cytotoxic
oedema

Introduction
Many important cellular processes are mediated by calcium. The movement and storage
of calcium in cells are subject to tight regulatory control, primarily through the
action of voltage gated calcium channels (L-type channels).1 In neurons, these calcium channels are the principal source for calcium entry
and membrane depolarization after energy failure.2,3 Drugs, such as nimodipine, that
block these calcium channels may reduce calcium influx into neurons and play a key
role in limiting neuronal cellular damage due to oxygen deprivation (cerebral hypoxia).2

Nimodipine is an L-type calcium channel blocker characterized by a highly selective
action on cerebral blood vessels and a high affinity for receptors in the
brain.4,5 This
preferential cerebral action of the drug has been explained by high transfer across
the blood–brain barrier compared with other calcium channel blockers.6 Nimodipine has been shown to improve outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid
haemorrhage, but this effect does not extend to other types of acute brain injury
such as trauma and stroke where there is restriction in blood supply (ischaemia).7 The precise mechanisms behind this beneficial effect remain unclear, but is
likely to be related to blocking calcium influx after tissue ischaemia at a neuronal level.8

In both focal and global cerebral ischaemia, there is substantial evidence of
variability in the tolerance of different brain regions to hypoxic-ischaemic damage.
Sub-cortical structures including the thalamus, the hypothalamus, basal ganglia and
cerebellum are particularly sensitive to hypoxic-ischaemic injury,9–11 with the thalamus in
particular showing early vulnerability in the acute phase.12 Poor functional recovery, (specifically in memory) has also been linked to
damage in the thalamus in animal studies,13 as well as cognitive dysfunction in patients surviving cardiac arrest and
traumatic brain injury.14,15 The thalamus is therefore a particularly interesting brain
structure in which to investigate the role of calcium in mediating cerebral injury
following hypoxia, especially as thalamic voltage dependent calcium channels are
likely to play a key role in higher-level cortical functions.16

Exposure of healthy volunteers to experimental hypoxia potentially offers a model of
in vivo reversible brain injury. Heterogeneous changes in diffusion-weighted imaging
metrics (e.g. apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) – an MRI marker of cerebral
oedema), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral volume have all been previously
reported after acute hypoxia.17–19 There has also been recent
interest in the significance of the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF)
in resting state functional MRI in health and in disease. Changes in ALFF have been
observed following traumatic brain injury20 and in Parkinson’s disease.21 Low-frequency oscillations in calcium (known as a biomarker of cellular
oscillations) show frequencies similar to those of deoxyhemoglobin (the main
contributor to the BOLD MRI signal) and precede them by 5–6 s.22 Changes in ALFF due to cellular calcium flux might therefore represent a
biomarker of acute cerebral tissue hypoxia and be influenced by calcium channel
blockade with nimodipine.

The purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to test the hypothesis that acute
hypoxia would have a significant effect on the thalamus, and second, that this
hypoxic effect would be attenuated by the administration of nimodipine. To test
these hypotheses, the objectives of this study were to quantify changes in ADC, grey
matter (GM) volume, CBF and ALFF associated with acute hypoxia using MRI in healthy
humans. We then aimed to investigate the impact of calcium channel blockade with
nimodipine on these changes, to offer mechanistic insights into therapeutic calcium
channel blockade clinically in patients.

Materials and methods
The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration as revised in
2008 and was approved by the local UK National Research Ethics Service Committee
(NRES Committee South Central – Berkshire: 11/SC/0519). Informed written consent was
obtained from all participants. Twenty right handed, healthy volunteers (11 males
and 9 females, mean age 28 ± 8 years) with no regular medication were recruited.
Specific exclusion criteria included routine contraindications to MRI scanning,
history of smoking and recent air travel or exposure to high altitude within the
last month.

Experimental design
Participants attended four separate experimental sessions (a minimum of one week
apart). Each session lasted approximately 5 h in total. The experiment was a
factorial design with the order of each session randomised for each subject. The
experimental conditions are shown in Figure 1(a) and were as follows: Poikilocapnic normoxia (“normoxia”)/Placebo

Poikilocapnic normoxia (“normoxia”)/Nimodipine

Poikilocapnic hypoxia (“hypoxia”)/Placebo

Poikilocapnic hypoxia (“hypoxia”)/Nimodipine

used to maintain hypoxic conditions in both the laboratory and MRI
sessions.



All conditions were normobaric. Drug/placebo conditions were double blinded for
each session with doses prepared by an individual independent of the research
group. Participants were blinded to gas mixture in all sessions. The researchers
running each experimental session were not blinded to the gas mixture. First
level MRI analysis was undertaken blinded to both normoxia/hypoxia and
drug/placebo conditions. Un-blinding was only performed once all first level MRI
pre-processing and analysis had been completed.

Experimental procedure
The study protocol consisted of a continuous 4-h session in a physiology
laboratory breathing either room air, with the usual fraction of inspired oxygen
(FiO2) of 21%, or a hypoxic gas mixture with the partial pressure
of end-tidal oxygen (PetO2) maintained at 7.3 KPa, followed
by an MRI scan with PetO2 maintained at the same level as
during the preceding 4 h. Depending on the session protocol (as per Figure 1(a)), participants
received either nimodipine 30 mg or placebo at both 1 h and 3 h into the
protocol depending on the experimental condition.

Acute hypoxia
Modulation of inspired O2 content during both the laboratory and MRI
sessions was achieved using a custom-built breathing apparatus (Figure 1(b)). During the
laboratory hypoxia condition, subjects inhaled gas from a hypoxicator unit
(HYP-123 Hypoxicator generator, Hypoxico Inc) with an FiO2 of 12%
(equivalent to an altitude of 4400 m) via a tight-fitting silicone facemask
(Hans Rudolph, 7540 series V2, Kansas City, MO, USA) to maintain an
PetO2 of 7.3KPa. Additional 7% O2 in nitrogen
from a cylinder was added as required to ensure tight control of
PetO2 for each participant. During the normoxia
condition, subjects received medical air at the same rate through the same
system.

The partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) was
not experimentally controlled during the laboratory and MRI sessions to
replicate normal cerebral physiological responses to hypoxia. Continuous
physiologic recordings were obtained for PetCO2 and
PetO2 (Gas Analyzer, AD Instruments, UK). Oxygen
saturations (SpO2), heart rate and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP)
were measured every 5 min (Dinamap Procare 300, GE Healthcare). For each
subject, the hypoxicator was turned on during all four sessions to ensure the
background noise was the same and that subjects remained blinded to the gas
mixture condition. During the MRI session, participants used a similar breathing
apparatus and a diving mouth-piece (Scubapro Ltd, UK) to maintain the same
PetO2 as used in the laboratory session for the duration
of the MRI scan.

Study drug
Nimodipine and placebo doses were produced by Ipswich NHS Pharmacy Manufacturing
Unit. Capsules were matched in colour, size and shape to ensure both
participants and investigators remained blinded to the experimental condition.
The dosing and oral route were chosen to replicate standard clinical practice in
patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and timed to aim for maximum serum
concentrations of the drug at the start of the MRI scanning session (based on
data from Hernández-Hernández R. et al.23). Although it was difficult to ensure peak concentrations of nimodipine
at the same timepoint in each session, blood samples were taken from each
participant at the 4 h mark in each session and any delay between blood sampling
and MRI scanning was the same for each session. Serum nimodipine levels were
then measured using customised mass spectroscopy (Sequani Ltd).

MRI scanning
A Siemens MAGNETOM 3T Verio scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany)
situated immediately adjacent to the physiology laboratory was used for all
scanning sessions. At the end of the 4-h laboratory session, participants were
moved immediately to the scanner room and placed directly onto the breathing
system. Disconnection time was kept to an absolute minimum. Heart rate,
SpO2) and NIBP were continuously monitored during MRI scans using
an MRI-compatible physiological monitoring system (3150/3155 MRI patient
monitor, In Vivo Research). Tidal O2 and CO2 were
monitored using a gas analyzer (Gas Analyzer, AD Instruments, NZ).

The scanning protocol included: T1-weighted MPRAGE structural to measure changes in GM

duration 1.4 s with six delays: 0.25 s, 0.5 s, 0.75 s, 1 s, 1.25 s,
1.5 s) along with calibration scans acquired with both head and body
coils for signal reception (24 s each, TR 6000 ms)

carotid/vertebral vessels: 1 min 27 s, 1.9 × 1.9 × 5 mm,

The scanning protocol was ordered as presented above and was conducted in the
same order for each experimental session. To quantify any potential change in
velocity through the carotid and vertebral arteries due to either hypoxia or
nimodipine, phase contrast images were acquired. This technique utilizes the
phase of an image to encode the velocity of flowing spins and has been validated
for angiogram and quantitative flow measurements.25

Post-processing of MRI data
All imaging analyses were carried out using FSL Version 5.0 (FMRIB Software
Library, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Centre, Department
of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk26) unless otherwise specified.

Volumetric structural data analysis
An optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was undertaken on the
T1-weighted images to identify regional changes in the thalamus and whole
brain GM volume (FSL-VBM: http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLVBM27). All images were processed following the same protocol: first,
structural images from all four experimental conditions, in all subjects,
were brain-extracted and GM-segmented before being registered to the MNI152
standard space using non-linear registration. The resulting images were
averaged and flipped along the x-axis to create a left-right symmetric,
study-specific GM template. Second, all native GM images were non-linearly
registered to this study-specific template and “modulated” to correct for
local expansion (or contraction) due to the non-linear component of the
spatial transformation. The modulated GM images were then smoothed with an
isotropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 3 mm. A thresholded (at 35%)
binarised probabilistic mask (Harvard-Oxford, FSL) of the thalamus in MNI152
standard space was used to obtain values for GM volume of both the
thalami.

We also investigated voxel-wise changes in volume over the whole brain GM,
using permutation-based non-parametric testing (5000 permutations),
correcting for multiple comparisons across space (see ‘Statistical analysis’
section below for further details).

DWI data analysis
ADC maps obtained from the scanner were brain extracted using the FSL tool BET28 and registration of the B0 image to the native T1-weighted image was
estimated for each subject with boundary based recognition.29–31 Next,
we combined this within-subject registration with the non-linear
registration of each subject’s GM-segmented image to the VBM template. At
the end of this registration process, ADC maps were therefore in the
study-specific VBM template space to ensure optimal group registration. The
same probabilistic mask of the thalamus used in the VBM analysis was applied
to maps from each condition to obtain average values for each participant.
Finally, voxel-wise statistical test was applied using permutation-based
non-parametric testing to look for changes in GM ADC across the whole brain
between the conditions of interest.

Perfusion-weighted data analysis
All related data processing steps essential for quantification of CBF
including tissue segmentation, estimation of equilibrium magnetization of
blood (M0b) from the mean CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) magnetization
(M0csf) within a ventricle mask, and generation of absolute
CBF in physiologic units (ml blood/100 g tissue/minute) were completed using
FSL tools and MATLAB (MATLAB R2015a, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, 2000)
as per Okell et al.24

Firstly, head motion was corrected using multi-resolution rigid body
co-registration of volumes, as implemented by MCFLIRT. Then multi-TI VEPCASL
data was processed using a non-linear fit to the general arterial spin
labeling (ASL) kinetic model for all voxels within a whole brain mask,
accounting for macrovascular signal, to quantify CBF.24,32
Similarly to the ADC analysis, total perfusion maps were registered to the
study-specific VBM template space by combining the spatial transformation of
each calibration body EPI image to the same subject’s T1-weighted image with
the corresponding VBM warpfield. Again, the probabilistic mask of the
thalamus was used to obtain average values for thalamic CBF.

Phase contrast MRI was used to assess the blood velocity in the carotid and
vertebral arteries at the location of the PCASL labelling plane.25 The phase contrast MRI acquisition was cardiac-gated using a pulse
oximeter. Vessel ROIs were manually created and applied to the cardiac gated
velocity maps to provide plots of blood velocity over the cardiac cycle.
Average velocity was then computed and compared to a simulated plot of
inversion efficiency versus velocity. Average vessel velocities in the range
of 15 cm/s to 45 cm/s result in an inversion efficiency of approximately 0.9,33 and were in this range for all subjects. As a result, the effects of
blood velocity at the labelling plane on inversion efficiency were likely to
be consistent across all subjects.

Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations analysis
Head motion was corrected using multi-resolution rigid body co-registration
of volumes, as implemented by MCFLIRT. Brain extraction was carried out for
motion corrected BOLD volumes as implemented in BET. This procedure was
verified with visual inspection of the extraction result for each data set
acquired.

Data denoising was performed using an independent component analysis (ICA)
approach which was used to decompose FMRI data into different spatial and
temporal components using FSL’s MELODIC (Multivariate Exploratory Linear
Optimised Decomposition into Independent Components34). The noise components were manually identified based on spatial
location of signal, time course and signal frequency.35 The FSL tool FIX36,37 was then used as
follows: To regress the full space of the motion confounds obtained from
MCFLIRT from both the data and from all the ICA component
time-series.

To estimate the contribution of both “signal” and “noise”
components as a means of identifying the noise specific
variance.

To remove the unique contribution of the components identified
above as “noise” from the data.



Additional data denoising in 13 subjects was also performed using a
combination of physiological noise modelling integrated in FEAT
(RETROICOR38,39) and ICA (described in 40) to assess the impact of measured changes in respiratory and heart
rate on ALFF between sessions. We were unable to perform this correction on
all datasets as five subjects had intermittent short (5–10 s) interruptions
in continuous physiological traces during scanning which rendered analysis
with RETROICOR impossible, so these five subjects were excluded from this
supplementary analysis. Results and figures from this analysis are presented
in the Supplementary Material.

We again registered the fMRI volumes to the VBM study-specific template
space. The resulting images were smoothed with 6 mm full width at half
maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.

Calculation of ALFF was then performed with customised MATLAB (Mathworks
Inc.) scripts using the Chronux Toolbox (www.chronux.org). The power of
the low frequency fluctuations in the frequency range 0.01–0.1 Hz was
measured using a multi-taper spectral estimation41 using discrete prolate spheroidal (Slepian) sequences with five
tapers, Fourier transform algorithm for the resting-state time series for
each voxel. The power between the 0.01 and 0.1 Hz band was divided by the
total power of the resolved frequencies from 0 Hz to the Nyquist frequency
to calculate normalised spectral power for that low frequency band. This was
performed to look specifically at changes within this low power band. We
used the same probabilistic mask of the thalamus to obtain average values
for ALFF in the thalamus region.

Statistical analysis
The contrasts of interest between conditions were: Effect of hypoxia on brain: Normoxia/Placebo v Hypoxia/Placebo.

Effect of nimodipine in normoxia: Normoxia/Placebo v
Normoxia/Nimodipine.

Effect of nimodipine in hypoxia: Hypoxia/Placebo v
Hypoxia/Nimodipine.



Statistical differences between these conditions were assessed using permutation tests,42 with the FSL tool randomise for the voxelwise analyses, using 5000
permutations, and with the tool PALM (Permutation Analysis of Linear Models
(https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM) for the
region-based analyses, using 10,000 permutations followed by the approximation
of the tail of the permutation distribution using a generalized Pareto distribution.43 Each p-value was adjusted for six comparisons, these
being the three differences in the positive and negative directions.
Significance for all tests was established at the level alpha < 0.05.
Finally, a repeated measures ANOVA was applied to the region-based data to
investigate the presence of an interaction between drug conditions and
oxygenation conditions to investigate whether nimodipine significantly modulates
the response to hypoxia.

For the voxelwise analyses in each modality, to account for the repeated
measures, the differences were calculated between each contrast (e.g.
normoxia/placebo v hypoxia/placebo) and then entered into a one sample
t-test, assessed with sign flippings. Voxelwise analyses
used threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE),44 with familywise error rate corrected across space. Results were
considered significant at the level alpha < 0.05.

The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate correlations between
blood levels of the drug nimodipine and MRI changes seen between the
Hypoxia/Placebo and Hypoxia/Nimodipine conditions with results considered
significant at p < 0.05.

Results
Complete laboratory and MRI datasets were obtained in 18 out of the 20 subjects. Two
subjects withdrew from the study due to scheduling issues preventing completion of
all sessions. During pre-processing and prior to unblinding, significant motion
artifact was discovered in one VEPCASL dataset throughout all sessions. This subject
was therefore excluded leaving only 17 subjects for the VEPCASL group analysis.

Physiological data
Figure 2(a) shows changes
in mean PetO2 and Figure 2(b) shows changes in end tidal
carbon dioxide (PETCO2) levels throughout the laboratory and MRI
sessions for all participants. The differences in PetCO2,
PETCO2, SpO2, heart rate and non-invasive blood
pressure between each condition are summarized in Table 1 along with significance values.

Compared with normoxia, as expected, the hypoxia condition significantly reduced
the PetO2 in both the placebo and nimodipine conditions.
There was a drop in PETCO2 values for both the placebo and nimodipine
conditions with hypoxia as the laboratory and MRI sessions progressed.

Nimodipine had no significant effect on either PetO2 or
PETCO2 compared to placebo in either the normoxia or hypoxia
conditions. Hypoxia resulted in a significant drop in SpO2 and
increase in heart rate in both placebo and nimodipine conditions. There was no
significant difference in mean arterial pressure between normoxia and hypoxia
and with nimodipine.

Nimodipine levels
Serum nimodipine levels for each experimental condition are presented in the
Table 1.
Importantly, there was no significant difference in nimodipine levels between
the normoxia and hypoxia sessions (18.90 ±20.33 ng/ml v 24.07 ± 24.62 ng/ml,
p = 0.73).

MRI results

significant clusters for Figure

Effect of acute hypoxia
Diffusion-weighted imaging
There was a significant decrease in ADC values in the thalamus for the
hypoxia condition compared to the normoxia condition (1061 ± 40 vs.
1011 ± 75 × 10−6mm2/s,
p = 0.0002) (Figure 3(a)). Whole brain
voxelwise analysis confirmed regional variation in GM ADC associated
with the hypoxia condition, with especially noticeable decreases in ADC
seen in the subcortical structures (thalamus, basal ganglia,
hippocampus) as well as the cerebellum (crus I and II regions – Figure 4(a)).

T1-weighted imaging
Figure 3(b) shows
that hypoxia resulted in a significant apparent increase in GM volume in
the thalamus ROI when compared to normoxia (0.3924 ± 0.028 vs.
0.370 ± 0.037 a.u., p = 0.0027). Looking voxelwise over
the whole brain though, there was no significant difference in GM
volume.

Perfusion-weighted imaging
Figure 3(c) shows
the results from the ASL perfusion-weighted imaging data for each
experimental condition. There was an increase in CBF in the thalamus ROI
for the hypoxia condition compared to normoxia (59.15 ± 10.00 vs.
50.34 ±6.68 ml/100 g/min, p = 0.0191). However, looking
at the whole brain GM voxelwise analysis, there were no areas of
significant difference in GM CBF between the normoxia and hypoxia
conditions.

Table 1 also
presents the results for the phase contrast imaging for each
experimental condition. Flow through both carotid arteries was
significantly higher in the normoxia condition when compared to hypoxia.
This was not the case for the vertebral arteries, where there was no
significant difference in flow values.

Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
There was a large increase in normalised ALFF in the thalamus
(35.24 ± 2.43 vs. 41.20 ± 1.85, p = <0.0001) with
hypoxia compared to normoxia (Figure 5). Results for GM are
provided for comparison along with full power spectra for both the
thalamus ROI and whole brain GM. These differences remained significant
when the additional data physiological denoising was conducted as

Data).

Effect of nimodipine under conditions of normoxia
Diffusion-weighted imaging
There was no significant difference between nimodipine and placebo in the
thalamus (1061 ± 40 vs. 1050 ± 55 × 10−6 mm2/s,
p = 0.1363). There was also no significant regional
or global effect on whole brain GM ADC values using voxelwise
analysis.

T1-weighted imaging
Like the DWI data, compared with placebo, there was no significant
difference in volume in the nimodipine condition for the thalamus
(0.370 ± 0.037 vs. 0.3781 ± 0.035 a.u., p = 0.2370) and
no significant difference seen over whole brain GM using voxelwise
analysis.

Perfusion-weighed imaging
There was a significantly increased thalamic CBF in the nimodipine
condition compared with placebo (59.49 ± 11.70 ml/100 g/min vs.
52.26 ± 6.91 ml/100 g/min, p = 0.037). However, there
was no significant difference seen over whole brain GM using voxelwise
analysis. Looking at the phase contrast results, velocities through
carotid and vertebral arteries were not significantly different between
the nimodipine and placebo conditions.

Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
There was a significant reduction in normalised ALFF in the thalamus
between nimodipine and placebo in the normoxia condition (41.20 ± 1.85
vs. 40.24 ± 1.88, p = 0.028). Again, full power spectra
and values for GM are provided for comparison in Figure 5.

Effect of nimodipine under conditions of hypoxia
Diffusion-weighted imaging
In the hypoxia condition, there was a significant increase in ADC values
with nimodipine towards baseline in the thalamus compared to placebo
(1059 ± 49 vs. 1048 ± 34 × 10−6mm2/s,
p = 0.0171). There was also a significant
interaction effect between nimodipine and hypoxia
(p = 0.0002). Furthermore, there was also a significant
positive correlation between the change in ADC values in the thalamus
between hypoxia/placebo and hypoxia/drug conditions and serum nimodipine
levels (r = 0.60 p = 0.0083) with
higher nimodipine levels in subjects associated with greater change in
ADC values (Figure
6).

Figure 4(b) shows
the voxelwise changes between the hypoxia/placebo and hypoxia/nimodipine
conditions. Again, there was a significant increase in ADC across
multiple subcortical regions including the thalamus, basal ganglia
(putamen and caudate), hippocampus and cerebellum with the
administration of nimodipine.

Finally, voxelwise comparison was performed between normoxia/placebo and
hypoxia/nimodipine which showed no significant differences over whole
brain GM confirming the reversal of the effect of acute hypoxia.

T1-weighted imaging
Nimodipine had no significant effect on the volume of the thalamus
(0.382 ± 0.050 vs. 0.392 ± 0.028 a.u., p = 0.5291) in
hypoxia versus placebo. There was no significant interaction effect
either between drug condition and oxygenation condition
(p = 0.1480). Voxelwise analysis showed no
significant effect on whole brain GM volumes.

Finally, there was no significant correlation between the change in the
thalamus volume between hypoxia/placebo and hypoxia/drug conditions and
serum nimodipine levels (r = − 0.04, p = 0.87).

Perfusion-weighted ASL imaging
We did not observe any significant difference in the thalamus CBF under
conditions of hypoxia for nimodipine versus placebo (60.29 ± 12.00 vs.
58.48 ± 7.86 ml/100 g/min, p = 0.9158) or any voxelwise
differences in GM CBF. There was also no significant interaction effect
(p = 0.4042). There was also no significant
correlation between the change in the thalamus CBF between
hypoxia/placebo and hypoxia/drug conditions and serum nimodipine levels
(r = −0.188 p = 0.4710).

Looking at the phase contrast results, velocities through both carotid
and vertebral arteries were not significantly different between the
nimodipine and placebo conditions under conditions of hypoxia.

Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
In the thalamus, there was a significant increase in ALFF with nimodipine
when compared to placebo (37.87 ± 1.66 vs. 35.24 ± 2.43,
p = 0.0003)(Figure 5). Furthermore, there was
a significant interaction effect between drug and oxygenation conditions
(p = 0.0002). Like the DWI results, the degree of
increase in thalamic ALFF with nimodipine in hypoxia showed a
significant positive correlation with nimodipine levels (r = 0.54,
p = 0.02).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that calcium channel activity
mediates the cerebral response to inspiratory hypoxia in vivo in humans. Through
this, we aimed to clarify the role of calcium in the pathophysiology of acute brain
injury in clinical practice. Several notable findings have arisen from this study.
Firstly, acute hypoxia causes a clear reduction in ADC and ALFF values in the
thalamus. These changes are accompanied by an apparent increase in thalamic volume,
together with an increase in thalamic CBF. Calcium channel blockade with nimodipine
attenuated the effects of cerebral hypoxia on ADC and ALFF values seen in the
thalamus and other cortical/sub-cortical areas, returning values back towards
baseline levels seen in normoxia. Finally, changes in ADC and ALFF with nimodipine
showed a significant correlation with nimodipine levels in hypoxia.

Cerebral effects of acute hypoxia
Previous studies using MRI to investigate the effect of acute hypoxia on the
brain have reported contradictory results showing either increased17,19 or
reduced18,45,46 ADC values. This may be due to differences in study/MRI
protocols, duration of hypoxic stimulus and barometric pressures. In our study,
the duration of hypoxia was chosen at 4 h in order to compensate for initial
changes in CBF and ventilation that occur in the first 30 min post-hypoxic stimulus47 and to allow potential MRI biomarkers of pathophysiological changes
associated with hypoxia to develop. Our results demonstrate that the thalamus is
sensitive to acute inspiratory hypoxia with significantly decreased ADC values.
These results were replicated in a secondary voxelwise whole brain analysis.
This further highlighted decreased ADC in other subcortical structures such as
the caudate, putamen, hippocampus and cerebellum – areas also known to be
susceptible to hypoxic-ischaemic damage. Reduced ADC values are generally
interpreted to be due to cytotoxic oedema associated with intracellular
swelling, and are associated with changes in cellular energy status responsible
for reduced Na + /K + ATPase pump and altered ionic homeostasis.17,19

Analysis of the T1-weighted data shows that thalamic volume was apparently
increased with acute hypoxia. Other studies have reported similar effects
following exposure to acute hypoxia with increased total brain and GM volumes
associated with reduced whole brain ADC.18,45 This increase is likely to
result from cellular swelling due to cerebral oedema associated with inspiratory
hypoxia. MRI evidence of cerebral oedema has also been noted as early as the
first hour of hypoxic exposure, associated with significant shifts in
intracranial CSF volumes.48

The results from the VEPCASL analysis suggest this increase may be due to the
increase in CBF seen with acute hypoxia on CBF in the thalamus. Voxelwise
changes in CBF were not seen over the whole-brain which is in concordance with
other studies which have reported no difference in whole brain GM CBF in acute
poikilopcapnic hypoxia.45 It may also reflect the cerebral vasoconstriction that occurs because of
the increased ventilatory response to hypoxia as well as issues with
signal-to-noise ratio seen with ASL studies.

Effects of calcium channel blockade on cerebral physiology during
normoxia
In normoxia, nimodipine had no significant effect on ADC nor GM volume in the
thalamus. However, there was a significant 14% increase in thalamic CBF and a
reduction in ALFF. Nimodipine is characterized by a highly selective action on
cerebral blood vessels and a high affinity to receptors in the cerebral cortex –
hence the interest in its use clinically following acute brain injury. However,
the literature investigating the effect of nimodipine on CBF is inconsistent.
Early studies in animals under conditions of ischaemia demonstrated no effect on
cerebral metabolism but increases in CBF due to a direct vasodilatory effect
across all brain regions, particularly following disruption of the blood–brain
barrier.4,49–51 However,
nimodipine had no significant effect on normal CBF or metabolism in animals.52 Early studies into nimodipine in both healthy volunteers and patients
suffering from stroke suggested a small overall increase in CBF after nimodipine
treatment, with a redistribution of blood to hypoperfused regions in
patients.53,54 However, subsequent studies have shown no effect of
nimodipine in healthy volunteers in concordance with the results of our study. 55 This may be as a result of differences in drug dose and timing as well as
differences in CBF measurement techniques.

The effect of nimodipine under conditions of cerebral hypoxia
Results from this study demonstrate that nimodipine reverses decreases in both
ADC and ALFF seen in the thalamus with acute hypoxia without an apparent effect
on CBF The whole brain analysis also showed similar increases in ADC across the
GM including subcortical structures such as the putamen, caudate, hippocampus
and cerebellum. There was also a significant positive correlation between the
change in ADC values between Hypoxia/Placebo and Hypoxia/Nimodipine conditions
and serum nimodipine levels in the thalamus. Voltage-gated calcium channels are
essential for calcium signaling in excitable cells and play a key role in the
final common pathway of acute cerebral ischaemia. Furthermore, L-type channels
are known to display a particularly high sensitivity to hypoxia.56 In experimental models of focal and global ischemia, L-type calcium
channel antagonism with nimodipine has been shown to have a neuroprotective
effect, attenuating cognitive dysfunction and increasing the hypoxic tolerance
of brain tissue.57,58 Nimodipine has also consistently been shown to reduce the
incidence of secondary cerebral ischaemia and improve clinical outcomes after
aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage59–61 – without any effect on
cerebral vasodilatation.

Our results suggest that calcium channel blockade with nimodipine acts to reduce
cytotoxic cerebral oedema following acute cerebral hypoxia without increased
CBF. Other studies have suggested that nimodipine may have an effect on cerebral metabolism62 which may underlie this effect on ADC and explain the clinical benefit
seen in SAH, a condition characterized by high levels of cytotoxic cerebral
oedema. Finally, there did not appear to be a difference in
PetCO2 with nimodipine, suggesting that changes in CBF
are unlikely to be due to differences in ventilatory control. Other studies have
demonstrated that nimodipine does not seem to exert a significant impact on the
effect of hyperventilation in reducing regional CBF63 and interferes with the CBF response to alterations in arterial CO2.64 This may partially explain why there was no significant increase in CBF
with nimodipine under conditions of hypoxia.

The variation in nimodipine levels despite consistent dosing between subjects
suggests that the pharmacodynamics of the oral administration route may be an
important factor in the use of nimodipine clinically in patients. There was also
a strong correlation between serum nimodipine levels and changes in ADC and ALFF
seen with nimodipine in hypoxia. This highlights that monitoring of drug levels
may be important if consistent clinical outcome benefits are to be achieved,
e.g. following subarachnoid haemorrhage.

ALFF
To date, no other studies have considered the exact role of the ALFF in cerebral
hypoxia. Clinical studies have suggested that changes in ALFF in disease states
may be a marker of brain damage. Altered ALFF in frontal brain regions is seen
in patients recovering from traumatic brain injury,20 as well as in the cerebellum in patients with migraine and
depression.65,66 Increased ALFF in the thalamus is also positively
correlated with microstructural damage seen on MRI in multiple sclerosis.67 Our results show that acute inspiratory hypoxia results in a significant
drop in thalamic ALFF in the BOLD signal replicating changes seen in disease
states. Calcium channel blockade with nimodipine in normoxia also leads to a
significant decrease in ALFF in the thalamus – potentially due to the role of
calcium oscillations in resting brain neuronal activity. However, in the
presence of hypoxia, the administration of nimodipine significantly increases
ALFF normalizing levels to those seen in normoxia. Regional heterogeneity in the
BOLD response to hypoxia has previously been reported in both animal
studies68,69 and studies in humans.70 The underlying mechanisms that could lead to this are poorly understood
and include different changes in total deoxyhaemoglobin for a fixed change in
arterial oxygen saturation due to different blood volumes and/or different
oxygen extraction fractions and flow-induced variation in saturation and signal intensity.69 It may be that subcortical structures such as the thalamus have a
different oxygen extraction fraction at rest than other areas of the brain and
are therefore more sensitive to changes in arterial oxygen content. Though the
absence of significant correlation between CBF and change in ALFF with
nimodipine in hypoxia suggests that this difference may be related to a
mechanism of action of calcium channel blockade on neurons (potentially via an
effect on low-frequency oscillations in calcium levels) rather than a direct
vascular effect.

Conclusion
In summary, we have provided evidence for a preferential effect of calcium channel
blockade with nimodipine under conditions of acute cerebral hypoxia in reversing
changes in ADC and ALFF in the thalamus. These changes to ADC and ALFF may underlie
the benefit seen clinically in conditions like SAH where significant global
cytotoxic cerebral oedema is seen with early brain injury. Further research is
needed into the importance of changes in ALFF with hypoxia and whether this
represents a biomarker of cerebral tissue hypoxia in acute acquired brain
injury.
