Sleep problems are pervasive in people with schizophrenia, but there are no clinical
guidelines for their treatment. The Better Sleep Trial (BEST) concluded that suitably
adapted cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) is likely to be highly effective, although
its cost-effectiveness is unknown.

Aims
To assess the potential cost-effectiveness of CBT for sleep disorders in patients with
schizophrenia.

Method
An economic evaluation of the BEST study with a 6-month time horizon was used to
establish the cost-effectiveness of CBT plus usual care in terms of costs per
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Uncertainty was displayed on
cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves. Value of information analysis was
performed to estimate the benefits of obtaining further evidence.

Results
On average, the treatment led to a 0.035 QALY gain (95% CI −0.016 to 0.084), and £1524
(95% CI −10 529 to 4736) and £1227 (95% CI −10 395 to 5361) lower costs from National
Health Service and societal perspectives, respectively. The estimated value of
collecting more information about the effects of the CBT on costs and QALYs was
approximately £87 million.

Conclusions
CBT for insomnia in people with schizophrenia is effective and potentially
cost-effective. A larger trial is needed to provide clear evidence about its
cost-effectiveness.

Relevance
Patients with schizophrenia have multiple complex health needs, as well as very high
rates of depression, suicidal ideation and poor physical health. The results of this
study showed that treating pervasive sleep problems in this patient group with
cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) is very likely to improve patient quality of life in
the short term. Clinicians most commonly use hypnotic medication to treat sleeping
disorders. This study indicates that CBT may be an effective and cost-effective
intervention in this patient group. This alternative would also be aligned with patient
preferences for psychological and behavioural-type therapy.

==== Body
Schizophrenia is among the top ten disorders in terms of burden of illness, disability, and
societal and health costs worldwide.
1
 In England, there are approximately 8256 new cases of schizophrenia each year
2
 and the total annual cost of schizophrenia to society is £11.8 billion.
3
 In addition, life expectancy is 15 years shorter for people with these problems.
3
,
4
 Sleep problems are pervasive and complex in patients with schizophrenia and adversely
affect physical and mental health.
5
 These problems typically comprise a mixture of insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm
disorders and nightmares, and their evidence-based treatment in schizophrenia has been
overlooked.
6
 However, how to treat such sleep disturbance in the context of schizophrenia is not
the topic of any guideline. The effectiveness of cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) in
treating sleep problems in patients with schizophrenia was only recently assessed in the
Better Sleep Trial (BEST).
7
 The findings from this pilot randomised controlled trial suggest that CBT for
insomnia, suitably modified for this population, is likely to be highly effective for
improving sleep in patients with schizophrenia. However, given that healthcare resources in
mental health are particularly scarce,
8
 it is important that any new intervention, particularly one delivered face-to-face to
patients, provides good value for money. As a result, the aim of this study was to use data
from BEST to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of CBT in treating sleep disorders in
patients with schizophrenia.

Method
Study design and patients
We carried out an economic evaluation alongside BEST to establish the cost-effectiveness
of CBT in addition to usual care to treat sleeping disorders in patients with
schizophrenia. BEST was a prospective, assessor-blind, randomised controlled pilot study
in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire, England. The study recruited 50
patients with persistent, distressing delusions or hallucinations in the context of
schizophrenia adult mental health services. Details of the trial and the clinical findings
have been reported elsewhere.
7
 The economic evaluation was conducted from National Health Service (NHS) and
societal perspectives, complying with guidance for health technology appraisals issued by
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England.
9
 Outcomes and costs were assessed at baseline, and at 12 weeks and 24 weeks
post-treatment. The trial flowchart is presented in Appendix 1.

Intervention and comparator
The CBT intervention included approximately eight sessions over 12 weeks provided
one-to-one by clinical psychologists either in NHS clinics or at patients' homes under
weekly clinical supervision by a consultant clinical psychologist. Telephone calls and
text messages between sessions were used to maintain treatment momentum. The intervention
was written in a manual to guide the work, which was shared with the patient. The
principal therapeutic techniques included stimulus control (i.e. learning to associate bed
with sleep) and improvement of daytime activity levels. Adaptations needed for the
particular problems of delusions and hallucinations interfering with sleep, attempts to
sleep being overused by patients as an escape from voices, extensive disruption of
circadian rhythms, insufficient daytime activity and fear of the bed based on past adverse
experiences were incorporated. Standard care was delivered according to national and local
service protocols and guidelines and mainly consisted of antipsychotic medication and
contact with the local clinical team.

Outcomes and costs
Health-related quality of life was measured during the follow-up period using the EuroQol
5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. The five-level version of the EQ-5D-5L
questionnaire was preferred over the three-level version, because it is considered to be
more sensitive for capturing the health-related quality of life of a relatively young
population with mental conditions. EQ-5D-5L responses were then valued using population
preferences
10
 and combined with survival information to calculate quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs).

Costs were measured with a modified version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory.
11
 The recall period in this questionnaire was 6 months at baseline, and 3 months in
each of the two follow-up measurements (hence covering the 6 months after baseline). The
health and social care costs included were: admissions to hospital; psychiatrist and other
consultant visits; general practitioner and other primary healthcare visits, either at
home or at the general practice; visits to and by community psychiatric nurses; visits to
any counsellor or therapist; social worker visits; visits to any day care centre; and
antipsychotic medicines. The intervention costs were collected for each patient included
in the treatment group and included the time taken for the psychologist to deliver the
sessions, travelling time to home visits, additional contact time via phone and emails,
time for administration and travelling costs. The broader societal perspective also
included the costs of informal caregiving (i.e. hours of unpaid care delivered to patients
by their family and social environment) and justice services (i.e. contacts with police,
nights spent in a police cell or prison, and criminal or civil court appearances). All
costs were valued based on unit cost prices derived from different resources and reported
in 2014/2015 British pounds (£). The costs of informal caregiving were calculated based on
the national minimum hourly wage. A list of the unit costs and their sources is presented
in Appendix Tables 2.1 and 2.3.

Statistical analysis
In a descriptive analysis, we used t-tests to obtain mean differences
(and their 95% confidence intervals) in age, EQ-5D-5L utilities and costs between patients
in the CBT group and patients in the standard care alone group. We performed the same
descriptive analysis using Mann–Whitney tests to cross-check statistical certainty. Five
patients in the CBT group and two patients in the standard care alone group had missing
observations in EQ-5D-5L utilities and/or costs on one or more measurement points. The
pattern of missing observations is presented in Appendix Table 2.2. The main analysis included only complete cases (i.e. it
excluded seven patients with incomplete information on costs and/or EQ-5D-5L utilities).

To address uncertainty in the results due to the small sample size of the pilot trial, we
performed bootstrapping with replacement. For each of the 10 000 bootstrapped samples, we
estimated the mean and mean differences in costs and QALYs. The statistical analysis was
performed in STATA13.

Cost-utility and value of information analysis
An incremental analysis was performed, assessing the differences in costs between the two
interventions and dividing by the difference in QALYs gained in order to generate an
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). ICERs were estimated using both an NHS and a
societal perspective. The 10 000 bootstrapped pairs of incremental costs and incremental
QALYs were plotted on cost-effectiveness planes to display the uncertainty in the
estimated ICER. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were also derived to
display the probability of the CBT treatment being cost-effective, as the ceiling ratio
for the maximum acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio varies from £0 to £85 000 per QALY
gained.

BEST was designed to inform the design of a larger trial in order to gain more
information about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the CBT treatment for
sleeping disorders. Therefore, we followed NICE guidance and estimated the expected value
of perfect information (EVPI), which represents the monetary value of eliminating the
uncertainty in the cost-utility results.
12
 In other words, it provides decision makers with the value of acquiring further
information on costs and outcomes for a number of people who may benefit from the
additional research. EVPI can potentially be used to set research priorities. If the EVPI
exceeds the cost of collecting more information about the effects of an intervention on
costs and outcomes, then a further study for this purpose is considered to be worthwhile.
In this analysis, we assumed that 10 000 patients would be affected by the treatment per
year, based on a report about schizophrenia.
2
 We also assumed that the time frame over which the additional information could be
expected to retain its usefulness (i.e. before the intervention becomes obsolete from
newer interventions) would be 10 years. This time frame is frequently used in EVPI
studies.
13
 Using a discount rate of 3.5%, as suggested in NICE guidance, the effective
(discounted) population over a 10-year period was calculated to be 86 077 patients. This
population was used in the value of information analysis.

Sensitivity analyses
Four sensitivity analyses were performed to address the effects of missing data and the
difference in costs between the treatment arms at baseline on the cost-utility results. In
the first, multiple imputation with predictive mean matching (with three closest
observations) was performed to impute missing observations in costs and QALYs during the
follow-up period based on costs and EQ-5D-5L utilities at baseline. The imputation process
was partitioned by treatment arm and generated 500 imputed data-sets for each missing
observation. The data-set with the imputed values was then used in the bootstrapping
process, similar to the statistical analysis performed in the main analysis. In the second
sensitivity analysis, we used generalised linear models to estimate 6-monthly mean costs
(using gamma distribution and log link) and QALYs (using normal distribution and identity
link) in the two groups and their differences, adjusted for costs or EQ-5D-5L utilities at
baseline. The choice of family distribution and link function in the statistical models
were based on the modified Park test and Link test, respectively.

Propensity score matching (PSM) was used in the third sensitivity analysis to match
patients in the treatment arms based on their costs and EQ-5D-5L utility at baseline.
Local linear regression matching was chosen as it outperformed other PSM techniques
(including Mahalanobis, one-to-one, k-to-one, kernel, spline and inverse
probability weighting) based on percentage standardised bias and variance ratio. In this
analysis, all complete cases were included and PSM was performed in each of the 10 000
bootstrapped samples before estimating incremental costs and QALYs. In the last
sensitivity analysis, antipsychotic medication was excluded from the costs. This is
because other types of mental health medicines were poorly recorded in the questionnaires,
and the inclusion of only antipsychotic medicines could have introduced biases in the
results.

Results
Descriptive analysis
There were 19 patients in the CBT group and 24 patients in the standard care alone group
with complete information on costs and EQ-5D-5L utilities. As Table 1 shows, patients in the CBT group were on average 40 years old
and the majority were male (63%) and unemployed (84%). Their mean EQ-5D-5L utility was
0.58, which is relatively low compared with the 0.81 national average EQ-5D-5L utility of
40-year-olds in England. There were no statistically significant differences between the
two groups at baseline. The mean EQ-5D-5L utility was higher in the CBT group at 12- and
24-week follow-up, but these differences were not statistically significant. More details
on patient characteristics at baseline are provided eslewhere.

For the provision of the CBT, a psychologist spent on average 23 h per patient for
treatment, administration tasks and travelling to home visits. The intervention costs were
on average £490 per patient. For the detailed cost calculation, please see Appendix Table 2.4.

Table 2 presents the 6-month costs before and
after randomisation and the differences between the two groups. Compared with the standard
care alone group, patients in the CBT group had on average £1462 higher healthcare costs
in the 6 months before randomisation, mainly owing to higher day hospital costs (i.e.
£851) and higher hospital admission costs (i.e. £414). In the 6 months after
randomisation, patients in the CBT group had on average £1532 lower healthcare costs than
patients in the standard care alone group. The mean differences in total healthcare costs
before and after randomisation were mainly driven by the mean differences in day hospital
costs, from £851 higher in the CBT group to £2241 higher in the standard care alone group.
It should be noted that the −£2241 difference in mean NHS costs after randomisation
incorporates the £490 intervention costs in the treatment group. The difference in total
costs from the societal perspective between the two groups decreased from £1055 to −£1236.

Results of the cost-utility analysis
The results of the economic evaluation of the pilot study showed that the treatment leads
on average to a 0.035 QALY gain (95% CI −0.016 to 0.084), as well as £1524 (95% CI −10 529
to 4736) and £1227 (95% CI −10 395 to 5361) lower costs from the NHS and societal
perspectives, respectively (Table 3). Thus,
these results indicate that CBT is likely to have higher benefits at lower costs.

These are the mean estimates from 10 000 bootstrapped samples adjusted for
baseline costs or EQ-5D-5L utilities. For this reason, the costs reported here do
not correspond with the observed unadjusted costs reported in Table 3.

However, there was large uncertainty in the ICERs, led primarily by uncertainty in the
costs. This is illustrated in the cost-effectiveness plane (Fig. 1), which displays the point estimate as a black bold dot and
the uncertainty around the mean estimate as the surrounding ‘cloud’ of ICERs. This plane
shows QALY gains at 90% certainty (i.e. 90% of the 10 000 bootstrapped ICERs were in the
right half of the CE plane) and high uncertainty about the costs. The cost-effectiveness
plane with costs from the societal perspective was very similar (Appendix 3). Fig. 1 Cost-effectiveness plane (NHS perspective).



The EVPI analysis showed that the population EVPI was approximately £87 million at a £0
ceiling ratio and decreased to approximately £33 million at an £85 000 ceiling ratio. This
negative slope is explained by the negative ICERs resulted by the main analysis. The
results of the EVPI analysis are presented in Appendix
4.

Results of the sensitivity analyses
The results of the sensitivity analyses when using multiple imputation, propensity score
matching or excluding medication costs were very similar to the results of the main
analysis (Table 4). However, using regression
analysis to adjust incremental costs and QALYs for their baseline values resulted in a
0.040 (95% CI 0.005 to 0.074) QALY gain, as well as £1319 (95% CI −412 to 4319) and £1579
(95% CI −410 to 5094) higher costs from the NHS and societal perspectives, respectively.

that included 24 patients in the CBT group and 26 patients in the standard care
alone group.

For comparison purposes, the CEAC of the main analysis is presented alongside those of
the sensitivity analyses in Fig. 2. According to
the CEAC based on the main analysis, the probability of the CBT being cost-effective was
59% at a £0 ceiling ratio (i.e. the sum of 54 and 5% of 10 000 bootstrapped ICERs in the
south-east and north-west quadrants of the cost-effectiveness plane, respectively) and
increased to 83% at a £85 000 ceiling ratio. NICE suggests that the maximum acceptable
ICER (i.e. ceiling ratio) is between £20 000 and £30 000 per QALY gained. Considering this
range, the probability of the CBT treatment being cost-effective was 66% at a £20 000
ceiling ratio and increased to 70% at £30 000. The CEACs based on the sensitivity analyses
were similar to those for the main analysis, except for the CEAC of the regression-based
sensitivity analysis, which displayed less favourable results for the CBT at ceiling
ratios lower than £50 000. Fig. 2 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and population EVPI. SA, sensitivity

Discussion
Summary of main findings
This is the first economic evaluation of CBT for treating insomnia in people with
schizophrenia. The results from the economic evaluation showed that the CBT delivered in
the pilot BEST is likely to be more effective at lower costs in the short term compared
with standard care alone. The results are subject to high uncertainty, driven primarily by
large uncertainty in the costs. This might be explained by the small sample size and the
large variation in costs among the patients included in the trial, as well as the study's
short time horizon (i.e. 6 months post-randomisation).

Our results provide several indications that the CBT has the potential to be
cost-effective (i.e. having an ICER between £20 000 and £30 000 or below). Although not
statistically significant, the differences in costs between the two groups at baseline
were considerable (i.e. £1462 NHS costs), favouring the standard care alone group. Even
with this unequal staring point, patients in the CBT group had on average £1532 lower
health and social care costs than patients in the standard care alone group during the
follow-up period, indicating that CBT has the potential to be cost-effective. This
potential is enhanced by the 90% certainty in the results for improvement in patient
quality of life, which is expected to negatively affect costs in the longer term. In
addition, we used very conservative assumptions when assessing the costs of the CBT
intervention. For example, we used the upper range of additional contact time per
treatment session (i.e. 20 min) and administration time per treatment session (i.e.
30 min). Relaxing these assumptions to be more realistic could also increase the
likelihood of the CBT being cost-effective. The costs of productivity loss were not
included in the analysis because there was only one person in employment in each group.
However, the employment rate of people with schizophrenia in England is estimated to be
between 5 and 15%.
14
 If the costs of productivity loss were included in the analysis and the sample was
more representative in terms of employment, the likelihood of the CBT being cost-effective
might potentially be improved, as positive changes in quality of life could yield higher
participation in the labour market. Provision of sleep treatment also needs to be
considered in the wider context of psychosis services. Patients want help for sleep
problems, appreciate these concerns being taken seriously and value the provision of
highly effective treatment.
15
 Positive experiences of the provision of sleep treatment are likely to enhance the
take-up of effective treatments for other difficulties that the patients may experience.

The considerable uncertainty in the evidence available, however, warrants caution about
the pilot results. Additional empirical information is needed to reduce further decision
uncertainty (i.e. whether to provide CBT via the NHS). The results of the EVPI analysis
suggest that the value of this additional information is high (approximately £87 million
at a £0 ceiling ratio), given the large scale of the population affected by the decision
(i.e. 100 000 patients with schizophrenia with sleeping disorders in England). A recent
review concluded that economic evaluations with estimated EVPI values over £2 million were
very unlikely to receive recommendations against further research.
13
 Hence, our results suggest that undertaking additional major commissioned research
work, especially to collect more cost information, is necessary and worthwhile to further
reduce the decision uncertainty.

Challenges, strengths, and limitations
Similar to many pilot trials, the economic evaluation faced several challenges because of
the small sample size of BEST. The five patients with missing observations comprised 21%
of the patients in the CBT group, while the remaining 19 patients with complete
observations in this treatment arm were too few to perform reliable imputation methods.
Thus, a complete cases analysis was preferred in the main analysis, although this was
valid and efficient only under the assumption that missing observations in the outcome
variables (i.e. costs and EQ-5D-5L utilities in our study) are missing at random (i.e. the
probability that data are missing does not depend on the values of the missing data).
However, this might not be the case for the pilot BEST data, considering that
non-completers were more severely affected patients than completers in the CBT group (see
Appendix Table 2.4). Moreover, the small sample
size may have contributed to the relatively large differences in the mean costs between
the two trial arms at baseline. We performed PSM and regression analysis to reduce these
differences, but their results should also be interpreted with caution owing to the
limited statistical power. The economic evaluation had a short time horizon (6-month
follow-up), which precluded assessment of the effects of CBT on costs and outcomes in the
patient's lifetime. Poor-quality information on medication use was another limitation of
the study.

The major strength of this study was the performance of several analyses that addressed
the uncertainty in the results of the economic evaluation. Another strength was the value
of information analysis, which showed substantial monetary benefits of further study of
the cost-effectiveness of the CBT. To overcome the limitations of this study, future
studies could recruit a larger patient population that is more representative, especially
in terms of employment, and which is likely to have better-balanced costs at baseline.
Future economic studies could also adopt a long(er) time horizon in the analysis and
obtain good-quality medication data either by incorporating suitable questions in a survey
or accessing administrative data. The influence of the CBT on productivity and state
benefits could also be investigated in future studies.

Implications for patients, clinicians and policy makers
Patients with schizophrenia have multiple complex health needs, as well as high rates of
depression, suicidal ideation and poor physical health. The results of this study showed
that treating pervasive sleep problems in this patient group with CBT is very likely to
improve their quality of life in the short term. In the long term, such improvements could
potentially reduce depression, psychotic experiences, irritability, exhaustion,
drowsiness, reduced attention, poorer decision-making, cardiovascular disease, metabolic,
abnormalities, weight gain, risk of type II diabetes and reduced immunity. Clinicians
often use hypnotic medication to treat sleeping disorders. Clinical guidelines recommend
CBT as the treatment of choice for chronic sleep difficulties. The results of this study
indicate that CBT may be an effective and cost-effective intervention in this patient
group. This alternative would also be aligned with patient preferences for psychological
and behavioural-type therapies.
16
 If proven to be cost-effective, the CBT and associated training could be
implemented in the NHS via the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)
programme, which has been expanded for patients with severe mental illnesses such as
schizophrenia. Furthermore, the need for greater access to psychological treatments for
patients with schizophrenia is well recognised, and substantial investment has been
suggested for this purpose.
17
 Efficiency is a crucial factor for the NHS in making wise investments while facing
limited budgets, especially in mental healthcare. Our results indicate that CBT as
provided in BEST is likely to be cost-effective, but further evaluation is necessary
before stating whether it is good value for money or not.

Conclusions
This study found that CBT for treating insomnia in people with schizophrenia is likely to
be effective and cost-effective. A large trial designed to facilitate a thorough economic
evaluation is needed to provide further evidence about its cost-effectiveness. This
information is valuable and necessary to support decision makers in improving efficiency
in mental healthcare in England.

Funding
The trial was funded by a grant from the NHS National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)
Research for Patient Benefit Programme (reference PB-PG-0211-10007). The research was also
supported by a Wellcome Trust Strategic Award (098461/Z/12/Z) for the University of Oxford
Sleep and Circadian Neurosciences Institute. D.F. is supported by an NIHR Research
Professorship.
