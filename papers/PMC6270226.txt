So this study was carried out to test the effect of newly prepared compounds containing 1,3,4-oxadiazoles with different substituted groups on tyrosinase enzyme activity, hoping to use them in the treatment of some diseases arising from tyrosinase activity disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, autism, attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, and cancer.

1. Introduction
1,3,4-Oxadiazoles are of great practical significance [1] which is primarily due to their large number of uses, in the most diverse areas, for example in drug synthesis, as scintillation materials, in the production of polymers and dyes, and uses in photography as light screening agents. 1,3,4-Oxadiazole (OXD) derivatives are useful targets in the search for antivirals as they have been associated with many types of biological properties such as anti-inflammatory [2,3], antibacterial, antifungal activities [4,5] and HIV replication inhibition [6]. Oxadiazoles have often been described as bio-isosteres for amides and esters [7]. As a consequence of these characteristics, oxadiazoles have impacted drug discovery programs in numerous areas including muscarinic agonists [8,9], benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists [10,11], dopamine transporters [12], anti-rhinovirals [13], growth hormone secretogogues [14], 5-HT agonists[15], antispasmodics [16], nematocidal, fungicidal and microbicides [17], analgesics [18], anti-inflammatory agents [19,20], Fab I inhibitors as antibacterial agents [21], immnosuppressants [22], and also antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents [23], 5-HT antagonists [24], human NK1 antagonists [25], They have been used as peptide mimetics due to their particular geometric and electrostatic properties [26,27]. Accordingly, in continuation of our work [28,29,30,31,32,33,34], a variety of heterocyclic derivatives involving some new oxadiazoles have been prepared from saccharide derivatives, and their chemistry and the effect of these derivatives on tyrosinase enzyme [35,36,37,38], which is the rate limiting step in melanine biosynthesis [39] as well as different biological actions were studied [40].

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Chemistry
Ethyl 5-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutyl)-2-methylfuran-3-carboxylate(1) [41]was oxidized to the corresponding formyl derivative 2 [42,43], which was condensed with a number of aroylhydrazines to afford hydrazones 3a–c [44]. Oxidative cyclization of compounds 3a–c with iodine, yellow mercuric oxide, and magnesium oxide in dry ether [44] (yields 41%–47%) or by an improved procedure through refluxing with chloramine-T in ethanol [32] (which gave higher yields: 78%–91%) afforded the corresponding 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives 4a–c. Furthermore, boiling 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives 4a–c with hydrazine hydrate afforded the corresponding hydrazide derivatives, the 2-methyl-5-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)furan-3-carbohydrazides 5a–c (Scheme 1).

The 1H-NMR spectra of compounds 5a–c showed the disappearance of both the CH3 and CH2 protons of the ethyl ester group. Instead, they displayed two signals for the NH2protons in the δ 4.59–1.64range, and the NH proton of the hydrazide group at 9.82–9.00 ppm, respectively (for other protons see Experimental). The mass spectra of compounds 5a and 5c showed the molecular ion peaks at m/z 284 and 318, respectively. The base peaks of compound 5a and 5c appeared at m/z 171 and 105, respectively.

On the other hand, condensation of the hydrazide derivative 5a with a number of aldehydes afforded the corresponding hydrazone derivatives 6a–h (Scheme 1). The1H-NMR spectra of compounds 6a–h showed the disappearance of the NH2 protons and instead, displayed a singlet signal for the CH=N protons in the δ 10.2–8.30 range, while the NH protons appeared as a singlet at δ 8.85, 9.98, 7.85, 8.80, 9.52, and 9.38, respectively (see Experimental). The mass spectra of the compounds 6d, 6e, 6f and 6h showed the molecular ion peaks at m/z 417, 393,440 and 447, respectively; while the base peaks appeared at m/z 176, 115, 77 and 358, respectively (see Experimental).

Cyclization of the hydrazones 6a, 6e, and 6f with acetic anhydride under reflux, afforded the oxadiazoline derivatives 7a–c (Scheme 1). The mechanism of their formation probably proceeded through the highly stable enolized form.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives.

The 1H-NMR spectra of compounds 7a–c showed the disappearance of both the NH and CH=N protons. Instead, their 1H-NMR showed the methyl protons of the N-COCH3 group as a singlet in the δ 1.24–1.22 ppm range (see Experimental). In addition, the proton at position-5 in the triazole ring (Compound 7c) resonates at lower field than the proton of the oxadiazolyl ring due to the strong electron attracting property of the triazole moiety. On the other hand, oxidative cyclization of the hydrazone compounds 6b and 6d with chloramine-T afforded the corresponding 1,3,4-oxadiazolederivatives 8a and 8b in high yield (Scheme 1). The 1H-NMR spectra of compounds 8a and 8b showed the disappearance of both the NH and (CH=N protons (see Experimental). The mass spectrum of compound 8b showed the expected molecular ion peak at m/z 415, while the base peak appeared at m/z 91.

2.2. Biological Activity Assays
2.2.1. Enzyme Activity Assay
Tyrosinase enzyme was prepared from mushrooms in a phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0) according to the method of Yang and Robb [45]. The activity of the prepared enzyme solution was determined by following spectrophotometrically the formation of dopachrome at 30 °C. After addition of enzyme preparation (50 μL) to a cuvette containing phosphate buffer (1.2 mL, 50 mM, pH 6.0) and 10 mM L-dopa (0.8 mL), the solution was immediately mixed and the increase in absorbance at 475 nm (indicating the formation of dopachrome) was recorded with a UV-20100 spectrophotometer. A blank experiment was carried out as mentioned above using buffer (50 μL) instead of enzyme preparation [46].

2.2.2. Enzyme Activity Assay in the Presence of the Tested Compounds
Activity of the enzyme in the presence of the examined compounds was determined by following the above steps for the formation of dopachrome and each examined compound (0.8 mL, 10 mmol) separately, and the increase in absorbance at 475 nm was recorded, separately, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2 and Figure 1 and Figure 2. All tests carried out in triplicate.

2.3. Results
Our obtained data revealed that the examined compounds showed different effects [47] on the tyrosinase enzyme activity between inhibition and activation in which compounds containing one 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring in addition to the furan ring (compounds 6a, 6b, 6d, 6g) have an activating effect on the enzyme tyrosinase with different values(Table 1 and Figure 1). Compound 6a in which there is no substituent on the phenyl group, which probably makes it easier to bind with the active sites of the enzyme, showed the highest activation effect. The presences of substituents on the phenyl group such as halogens, or a nitro group (compounds 6b, 6d) decrease the activation ability of the compound, while compounds containing a CONHNH2 group have inhibitory effects (5a, 5c).

On the other hand compounds containing two 1,3,4-oxadiazole rings or one oxadiazole ring and one 1,2,3-triazole ring have inhibitory effects on tyrosinase enzyme (compounds 6f, 7a, 8a and 8b). In addition compound 7c which contains two 1,3,4-oxadiazoles and one 1,2,3-triazole ring has the highest inhibition effect (Table 2 and Figure 2). The increasing number of heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen such as 1,3,4-oxadiazole and 1,2,3-triazole rings has a noticeable inhibitory effect on tyrosinase enzyme.

IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 1600 spectrometer. 1H-NMR was recorded on a JEOL JNM ECA 500 MHz instrument using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on a GC-MS solution DI Analysis Shimadzu Qp-2010 unit. Elemental analysis was determined at the Regional Center for Mycology and Biotechnology, Al-Azhar University. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on silica gel plates. Solutions were evaporated under diminished pressure unless otherwise stated.
