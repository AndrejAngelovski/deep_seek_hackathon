counted? What counts? And to whom, how and why does it count? Addressing such questions
involves staying attentive to the technologies and infrastructures through which data come

An STS of, and for, public health
In recent years and across many nations, public health has become subject to forms of
governance said to be aimed at establishing accountability. It has given rise to what Hogle (2019) in her contribution to
this volume regards as assemblages (i.e. ‘arrangements of practices,
technologies, and theories that configure action in a sociotechnical space’) of
accountability. Important ideas about populations and groups emerge through such
‘accountability assemblages’, and they shape the rights and duties of the individuals who
come to be defined as belonging to such groups (Taylor, 2017; Taylor et al., 2017). The involved profiling
practices are technology intensive and politically volatile. The data infrastructures and
data practices emerging with reference to accountability often provide the basis for
knowledge claims about needs, causes, and effects relating to health and illness. In some
instances, population data also serve to hold powerful actors responsible for their use and
prioritizations of resources. Such data practices are said to create accountability, but
what does that word mean, and what does it do? How do these practices affect prevention,
healthcare and the state of public health?

This special issue explores accountability in public health from the perspective of Science
and Technology Studies (STS). We believe that it is time to gather STS work that makes
visible the diverse dynamics of accountability assemblages and therefore present case
studies of the data politics of accountability involved in public health and the population
health sciences. The contributions grew out of a panel originally convened for the 4S/EASST
Annual Meeting held in Barcelona in 2016. The discussions during the meetings illustrated
how STS has a lot to say about public health and accountability – as well as the processes
of ‘datafication’ (Ruckenstein and
Schüll, 2017) through which the two unite. Science and technology mediate
accountability assemblages at all levels: One cannot understand the workings of
accountability discourses without engaging the material practices through which they emerge
and come to have effects. By engaging each other’s work, we learned that ostensibly
straightforward empirical questions can open up intricate issues: What is counted? What
counts? And to whom, how and why does it count? The issues revealed affect the livelihood
and well-being of millions of people, enjoining renewed reflections on classical topics in
STS.

By bringing together papers that all relate to public health, accountability and processes
of datafication, we illustrate a diversity of practices in different public health settings
in wealthy countries situated in what is also sometimes referred to as ‘the Global North’.
We briefly highlight the topic of each paper (see the respective abstracts for a more
elaborate account), and then elaborate on themes uniting them.

In their contribution to this volume, Amelang and Bauer (2019) present a study of a cardiovascular risk score and its
translation to preventive medicine in Germany. They analyze how epidemiological risk scores
work as ‘accountability devices’ and show how they, despite their algorithmic character,
continue to be in the making. Cool
(2019) explores what she terms ‘accountability anxiety’ as a particular reaction
among population researchers in Sweden to European data regulation and potentially
conflicting demands of data protection and data sharing – thus showing how researchers
negotiate the burden of compliance, legal uncertainties, and ethical concerns. Hoeyer (2019) discusses the politics
of personalized medicine in the hyper-digitalized Danish healthcare system and suggests that
data might be useful not so much for the information they convey, but for the way in which
they deliver a promise of future knowledge, one that serves to postpone calls for present
action on inequality in health. Hogle
(2019) outlines the work of Accountable Care Organizations in the US that are
expected to deliver ‘value-based care’ and new forms of accountability, while simultaneously
creating potentially enduring impacts by facilitating data infrastructures for individual
profiling. Kalender and Holmberg
(2019) analyse the everyday work going into the making of population data by
following a German cohort study and suggest that the big numbers of epidemiology in a sense
also depend on small talk. They show how it takes a lot of ‘courtesy work’ to keep
participants enrolled. In their article here, Kerr et al. (2019) describe the development of
polygenic risk stratified cancer screening in Europe, North America, and Australia, and
argue that the emerging population tools create new stratifications and forms of
responsibility. Finally, Pickersgill
(2019) explores the proliferation of psychological therapy in recent years in the
UK as a consequence of strategic uses of population data and accountability. He suggests
that this shift can, to an extent, be regarded as an example of de-biomedicalization. Big
numbers can sometimes give room for therapeutic talk.

We begin the introduction with a discussion of the term ‘public health’ and how it is
emerging as a topic in STS. Then we examine the notion of accountability and its relation to
classic issues about power and knowledge, and take this as a stepping stone to a discussion
of the role of metrics and datafication as they currently play out in this field.

What is public health and why is it important for STS?
Public health is a term that has acquired three related, but still distinct meanings.
First, it is used to denote a state of health and illness in a population. Second, public
health is a scientific field aimed at ascertaining that state, identifying its determinants
and understanding the implications of attempts to modify it. Determinants have typically
been much more broadly conceived than in laboratory science or clinical medicine. They
include sanitation, food security, environmental factors, and social, economic and political
factors. This meaning of ‘public health’ can also be referred to as ‘public health science’
or ‘population (health) science’, with ‘science’ sometimes self-consciously pluralized as
‘sciences’ in order to underscore the heterogeneity of epistemologies and knowledge
practices comprising this epistemic complex (e.g. medical sociology, molecular epidemiology,
health economics, and so on). Third, public health can be taken to mean political programs
and infrastructures (existing or lacking) aimed at improving the state of health in a
population (however that population is constructed). Scholars sometimes slide unnoticeably
between the different meanings and move from insights into inequalities in health and
illness and their related determinants to arguments of political necessity. The slippage
between knowledge, activism and political intervention signals the enduring presence of the
classic biopolitical tension between power and knowledge characteristic of the wider field
of public health; it is a well-established insight that populations are counted to be
governable (Asad, 1994; Bowker and Star, 1999; Deleuze, 1992; Desrosiéres, 1998; Sætnan et al., 2011).

The techno-politics of population knowledge
In population health science, the object of knowledge is not the individual, but a
pattern or a rule (Armstrong,
2017). The populations dealt with are products of particular technologies of
counting and modeling (Bauer,
2013): different populations emerge from different modes and technologies of
counting (Grommé and Ruppert,
2019; Hacking, 1982;
Ruppert et al., 2017). These
technologies involve definitions and operate through materially embedded forms of creating
data as well as curating, storing, distributing, and analyzing them. How data is produced
and what is done with it are shaped also by political and economic contexts. For example,
in the Nordic countries, the socio-material and economic conditions facilitated the
establishment of national ‘registries’ (Bauer, 2014; Reinholdt,
2018), while population-level knowledge in Malawi came to involve very different
material practices dependent on paper-based surveys, fieldworkers and global economic
funding schemes (Biruk, 2018).
When the Gates Foundation funds the establishment of data infrastructures throughout much
of Africa (Adams, 2016a; Erikson, 2016), they are construed
in manners that differ significantly from data infrastructures in China or the US (Creemers, 2016; Deibert and Pauly, 2019). How
public health law, policy, and practice operate is profoundly shaped by the social and
material infrastructures through which data on health needs are generated and populations
come into being as objects of knowledge. This special issue presents examples from
infrastructures and practices enacted: in the US (Hogle, 2019), the UK (Pickersgill, 2019), Sweden (Cool, 2019), Germany (Amelang and Bauer, 2019; Kalender and Holmberg, 2019), Denmark (Hoeyer, 2019), and through
international, partly commercial, networks (Kerr et al., 2019). We illustrate the diversity of
practices in different public health settings to illustrate how STS can investigate
technologically mediated construction of populations and the translation of this knowledge
into societal action.

During the past two decades, a molecular turn in the population health sciences has
created extensive infrastructures of biobanks through which another set of ideas about
both population and individual emerge (Ackerman et al., 2016; Hoeyer, 2002; Radin,
2017; Tupasela et al.,
2015; Tutton, 2004).
This volume illustrates how infrastructures for population-based genetics can also emerge
out of developments in clinical care or commercial rearrangements. Such infrastructures
shape research options and thereby the patterns – and the ‘populations’ – that can be
‘discovered’. Another significant trend in public health has been the transition from
focusing on mortality (the statistics of life and death) to morbidity (the relative burden
of disease and quality of life measurements) (Moreira, 2019; Wahlberg and Rose, 2015). This focus on disease
burden and life-long risk is co-produced with tools of measurement and identification of
those at-risk and in need of additional treatment (Amelang and Bauer; Kalender and
Holmberg; Hogle, this volume). By defining and investigating public health in particular
ways, political options are shaped and particular futures made possible.

STS has contributed greatly to understandings of processes of numeration (Martin and Lynch, 2009; Porter, 1995), and the performative
work of algorithms, digitization and big data (Denis and Goëta, 2017; Edwards et al., 2011; Jaton, 2017; Stark, 2018). All of these developments are central
for understanding the field of public health, and yet public health research and practices
have not been subject to the same close scrutiny as traditionally more dominant modes of
technoscience and medicine – laboratory research, for instance (Latour and Woolgar, 1979). If laboratory science
and engineering often work with translations of models from bench or desk into practice
and deliver products for purchase and consumption, the field of public health often
depends on non-research infrastructures for data collection, and promotes results through
policy changes, rather than as sellable goods – although data-driven innovation in public
health is today often enjoined precisely as a means of bringing the population health
sciences into alignment with markets. It reverses a number of the dynamics that have been
studied in STS.

In this volume we describe different types of technological mediation of data practices
from seemingly simple checklists (Pickersgill, 2019) and documentary tools (Cool, 2019), to risk scoring (Amelang and Bauer, 2019; Hoeyer, 2019) and sophisticated algorithms that
remain black-boxed to many of their users (Hogle, 2019; Kerr et al., 2019). These mediations are
techno-metricized accountabilities. They are informed by politics, yet they cannot be
captured and described with reference to political intention alone. They operate on and
through both human and nonhuman actors, and participate in, inflect, and sometimes steer
wider socio-political action (Erikainen et al., 2019; Petersen, 2019; Watcher,
2017). Relevant to all of them are the symbolic and material processes through
which public health research and policy are represented and understood as legitimate and
authoritative – how public health is made accountable. Who is held accountable, through
which means, and for what?

Accountability: The intersection of knowledge and politics
Accountability is a matter of knowing, doing and becoming. In public health, accountability
assemblages are archetypical instances of biopolitics, defining who needs to know – and do –
what, and for and to whom (Foucault,
1991; Lemke, 2007; Rose, 2007). When, in the early
20th century, Max Weber
(1947) described the accountable public servant, he emphasized the need for secrecy
– an absence of data sharing (p. 233). A responsible bureaucrat needed to
document his (sic!) practice, but he also needed to be guarded against volatile political
interference. The closed archive was emblematic of this dual ambition. If, at the time of
Weber, the meaning of accountability centered on the private room for judgment handled by
public professionals, then by the end of the 20th century it had become
associated with system-level relations and obligations depending on access
to data documenting the public service delivery (Bessette, 2001). Today, in many (perhaps even most)
nations, data collection and data sharing are more or less taken for granted in political
discourses on accountability in healthcare. The closed archives have been replaced by data
infrastructures and varying forms of digital surveillance (Moore, 2018). Twenty-first century discourses of
accountability propagate rhetorics of ‘open government’ (The White House, 2013) and ‘transparency through
digitalization’ (Europa-Kommisionen,
2017). In healthcare, the emphasis is on ‘learning health-care systems’, using
digital data to enhance and monitor performance (Olsen et al., 2007). None of these discourses would
have any resonance, however, without technologically mediated data infrastructures promising
to make data available for real-time surveillance (Goëta and Davies, 2016). Technologies are the
foundations on which organizations may promise to produce ‘answers’ – if not now, then in an
undefined future (Hoeyer, this volume).

The multiple meanings of accountability
The tension between individual and system-level responsibility also can be identified at
the level of official definitions. Etymologically, accountability can be traced to
medieval theological discussions. In the 18th century, accountability entered
secular parlance as a ‘state of being answerable’ (Online Etymological
Dictionary). To be ‘answerable’ conveys an obligation to speak and to let
oneself be investigated, and in this sense accountability clearly refers to relations.
Furthermore, account-ability denotes both the sense of a moral obligation to answer and a
practical ability to deliver that answer. An answer might demand extensive work to produce
the needed knowledge. Relations of accountability thus involve moral relations that can
instigate documentary and analytical work dependent on science and technology.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines accountability with reference to
an individual, but then expands it to an aggregate level:The quality of being accountable; liability to account for and answer for one’s
conduct, performance of duties, etc. (in modern use often with regard to
parliamentary, corporate, or financial liability to the public, shareholders, etc.);
responsibility.



According to the Cambridge Dictionary, accountability defines ‘a
situation in which someone is responsible for things that happen and can give a
satisfactory reason for them’.

In other European languages, we similarly find moral valances. One common German
translation is Rechenschaftspflicht, which has a legal and moral tone to it emphasizing
legal obligation and duty. The respective French terms closest to accountability are
‘responsabilité’ (most frequent translation) and the phrase ‘rendre des comptes’, with
responsabilité pointing to institutional responsibility and liability after damage, as
well as moral and political responsibility, while the (more literally) related terms
‘compter’ is about to matter and to count, whereas ‘comptabilité’ is about financial
bookkeeping (resonating also with the English accounting and the German Rechenschaft). The
Danish translation is ‘ansvarlighed’ (meaning responsibility-ness, or the state of being
responsible), but the English word ‘accountability’ is often used in Danish policy texts
or prose about governance. Similarly, the Swedish word is ‘ansvarig’ (see also Cool, 2019), and the Norwegian is
‘ansvarlighet’, all of the same roots, and all with a focus on responsibility.

Though accountability denotes responsibility across a number of languages, it of course
remains negotiable who are responsible to whom and for what and how this is being emplaced
(Jerak-Zuiderent, 2015; see
also the contributions to this volume by Cool, Hoeyer, Hogle, and Pickersgill).
Nevertheless, it is safe to say that accountability is a concept that intervenes in
relations and in politics, as much as it describes these relations or political
situations. In the area of health, it comes to mediate relations of care. As Pols (2006) notes, ‘different
styles of accounting evaluate and legitimize care while structuring notions of what good
care is’ (p. 409). The concept is politically expedient partly because of its ability to
communicate a moral sense of obligation: by referring to accountability, political actors
can act on, shape or change relationships.

Debates about accountability in public health
Obviously, the theme of accountability features prominently also in debates about public
health (in all three meanings) (Beitsch and Corso, 2009; Kraak et al., 2014; Wholey
et al., 2010). One theme in public health debate is the issue of
purpose in allocating a responsibility (Fahlquist, 2006): Should it be to ensure good
outcomes (e.g. through incentives for prevention), or to ensure fair attribution of blame
(e.g. by holding those believed to be the cause of illness responsible)? Examples of this
conflict are discussed in several of the contributions to this volume (e.g. in the
articles by Hoeyer, Hogle and Kerr et al.).

Another theme in the population health science literature on accountability revolves
around who should set the goals of the accountability assemblages (Merry, 2016). For instance, the US
market-based system emphasizes economic accountability in negotiations between third-party
payers and service deliverers (Hogle,
2019), while state-centered European systems tend to focus on standardization of
care (Ashmore et al., 1989). In
global health, donor accountability and distribution of responsibility among funders and
local partners have been intensely debated (Adams, 2016a), but in their article in this volume
Kerr et al. (2019) also point
to global commercial assemblages that diversify responsibilities in new ways.

Yet another theme is for what actors should be held accountable: e.g.
patient-centered outcomes and quality standards, a wider sense of community health, human
rights, or levels of participation (Van Belle and Mayhew, 2016)? In this volume, Cool shows how European data
regulations make researchers contemplate towards whom they are accountable, while nobody
is really accountable for helping the researchers with meeting the new obligations. Hogle
illustrates tensions between being responsible for fiscal balance and good care, and
Pickersgill shows how feeling accountable for delivery of needed care can involve gaming
accountability assemblages to appear ‘effective’ according to criteria one might not
otherwise subscribe to or agree with.

Finally, an important theme has emerged in relation to how
accountability questions can be asked and what may count as epistemic bases for claims
made. Controversies about childhood vaccination have given such epistemic controversies a
very public form and simultaneously provided vivid examples of the messy relationships
between states, publics and citizens, as well as between individual liberty and personal
accountability, that play out when the public health of entire countries is at stake
(Decoteau and Underman,
2015). In this volume, Amelang and Bauer as well as Kalender and Holmberg, explore
the making and translation of epistemic tools connecting individuals to population
averages and population data to individuals. Taken together, these contributions
illustrate the intricate dynamics of accountability assemblages, and the need to stay
attuned to the specificities of each case. Accountability can be a double-edged sword.

The audit explosion: Economic, legal and numerical responsibility
The Google database of digitized English language books has a function, Ngram, through
which a graph can be generated indicating the prevalence of words in selected time
periods. An Ngram of the appearance of the word accountability (included in the Ngram
database) indicates that modest but regular usage began in the early 19th
century. The term was then used steadily until around 1970, when it suddenly became very
popular and from the 1980s it grew exponentially in use. The sudden exponential growth
might reflect the deployment of the term in programs of modernization of the public sector
typically associated with the vague term ‘neoliberalism’ and what Strathern (2000) has called the emergence of an
audit culture and Power (1997)
an audit society. Auditing, again, depends on and propagates investments in the creation
of documentary technologies that accumulate and preserve data for economic, organizational
and legal purposes (Bevan and Hood,
2006; Wadmann et al.,
2013). Through its association with audits, accountability came to focus heavily
on financial and legal accountability. The prominence of metrics in discourse about
accountability emerged along with the growing popularity of the financial meaning of the
term from the 1980s onward (Erikson,
2012; Sangaramoorthy and
Benton, 2012; Storeng and
Behage, 2017; Sullivan,
2017; Tichenor, 2016).
It has implied an intensified datafication of public health, and it is to the metrical
practices in public health (in all three meanings of the term) we now turn.

The datafication of public health
If accountability has come to be related to counting, what does it mean to count? Martin and Lynch (2009) note that
‘counting’ initially appears to be a mundane and straightforward activity, yet it demands
intricate systems of classification to count and such systems can be highly
context-dependent and ambiguous. The world does not come in readymade packages that can be
counted; to count in a domain, it must be possible to delineate the domain’s objects, and
the agents counting must have access to relevant data. The matching of categories to the
amorphous world has been a foundational problem for philosophical epistemology, as famously
pointed out by Foucault (1999) in
The Order of Things. Kant (2017 [1781]), for one, struggled to establish
foundational grounds for objects of knowledge, while dismissing a purely empiricist
argument; his solution was to be found in a priori structures of reason that should
determine what could be meaningfully made into an object of knowledge.

Whereas Kant sought a priori structures for reason, Foucault focuses on the historical
contingency of the involved forms of reasoning. Work on the history of statistics and
population knowledge has followed the Foucauldian line of inquiry, exploring how political
institutions for the production of population knowledge have shaped the ‘objects’ that are
counted (Desrosiéres, 1998, 2011; Hacking, 1990; Plant, 1998; Porter, 1995). This work has shown how it is a
political as much as an epistemological achievement to establish a statistical object (Moreira, 2019). Populations do not
simply exist as objects of knowledge, but are products of data practices (Moreira and Palladino, 2011). In
Desrosiéres’ (1998) words, ‘The aim of statistical work is to make a priori separate things
hold together, this lending reality and consistency to larger, more complex objects’ (p.
236). Statistics work from data, but these first need to be produced (Biruk, 2018; Gitelman and Jackson, 2013). Data are not raw
materials; they are, as suggested by Latour (1999), achievements (p. 42). This special issue contributes to the study
of these achievements and thereby to the opening up what is all too often described as a
simple process of ‘datafication’, as when big data proponents state: ‘To datafy a phenomenon
is to put it into a quantified format so it can be tabulated and analyzed’ (Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier, 2013:
78). We do not dismiss or criticize the usefulness of datafication per se (Muller, 2018), but we emphasize the
need to understand better when it is valuable, for whom, and for which purposes. In some
instances, new data infrastructures can create visibility (Ginsburg and Rapp, 2017; Rabeharisoa et al., 2014), and in others they involve
forms of decontextualization of information in ways that facilitate deliberate or unintended
unknowing (Geissler, 2013) or
ignorance (McGoey, 2012).

From epidemiology to big data
Epidemiology delivered the core method of population health science and epidemiologists
drew on big data sets long before big data came into fashion (Bauer, 2014; Hoeyer, 2019). The emergence of clinical
epidemiology was foundational for the creation of the movement called evidence-based
medicine (Lambert, 2006), yet
the basic extrapolation from the population level to individual patients or citizens
continues to be contested (Armstrong,
2017; Holmberg et al.,
2013). Epidemiologists have pointed out how population data cannot predict
individual outcomes, and some epidemiologists talk about the replacement of statistical
probability with individual prediction as the ‘ecological fallacy’ (Henderson and Keiding, 2005; Piantadosi et al., 1988). The troubled link between
individual and population also means that public health scholars acknowledge that it is
often necessary to treat a given number of persons who will not directly benefit as
individuals, to reach population-level effects (Brodersen et al., 2018). People are treated or
expected to engage prevention in pursuit of an effect that can be detected at the
population level, but not necessarily by each and every individual. Sociologists have
criticized how, as a consequence, individuals are held responsible for the achievement of
population goals (Armstrong,
2017; Lupton, 1997).
Several articles (see contributions by Amelang and Bauer, Hoeyer, and Hogle) in this
volume present examples of individualization of responsibility, and, in particular, Kerr
et al. show that individualization of responsibility can take many forms; techno-political
accountability assemblages can diversify, expand and stratify responsibility in new
ways.

The so-called big data movement has given the ecologic fallacy renewed traction. Profiles
based on aggregate data from multiple domains (including data previously unrelated to
health), are increasingly used in individual-level practices (Hoeyer, and Hogle in this
volume). In the big data movement, former distinctions between the population level and
the individual level collapse and correlations are made to work as tools of predictions
irrespective of the expectations in classic epidemiology of models, theory and controls
(Stark, 2018). Lury and Day (2019) suggest that it
has created an ‘age of personalization’, where population data compile ‘types’ and use the
unique patterns of such characteristics to rank and market individuals and organizations.
Such data-intensive profiling tools are marketed as key to the delivery of ‘public health
management’ (Hogle, this volume). They also mark a break with a 400 year monopoly of the
state on population data and a transition to a more fluid and market-based form of
knowledge production in the population sciences (Bigo et al., 2019, Kerr et al., 2019). Zuboff (2019) even suggests that they form part of
a new mode of production – surveillance capitalism. Our point here is more limited and
relates to the politically ambiguous effects of new data assemblages: Individuals at risk
and in need of help are simultaneously framed as a risk to the population – with respect
to the aggregate state of health and as financial risk to the healthcare system and the
payers (see Hoeyer, and Hogle, in this volume). This revivifies the possibilities of
punitive effects on individuals of the kind that public health law, policy and practice
have always wrestled with.

Global ramifications
The datafication of public health is a phenomenon with implications far beyond the
so-called Global North. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly decided on 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), broken down into 232 indicators, to define
medium-term directions for international collaboration on health, poverty, gender equality
and environmental sustainability. The datafying logic and format of SDGs can also be found
in another very influential UN report, A World That Counts (The United Nations Secretary-General’s
Independent Expert Advisory Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development,
2014). It states that ‘[i]mproving data is a development agenda in its own right’
(p. 3), and explained that this is because ‘[d]ata are the lifeblood of decision-making
and the raw material for accountability’ (s. 2). The report also proclaimed an ostensibly
new vision for global public health: ‘Never again should it be possible to say “we didn’t
know”. No one should be invisible. This is the world we want – a world that counts’ (p.
3). In this way, the logic of datafication as a tool for accountability is here taken to
an extreme with the belief that it is a special task for metrics to make human suffering
visible and that it is through metrics only that the international community can be held
accountable. From this perspective, to be seen, known and acknowledged is
to be counted.

Despite the breathlessness of the UN report, and its presentation of data-driven public
health as novel and vital, the notion that global organizations need to set goals and
measure them has a significant history. Halfon (2006) has argued that one key element in
this process of datafication (Ruckenstein and Schüll, 2017) was the 1994 report of the International
Conference on Population and Development (also known as the Cairo consensus
document). It set goals and standards for measuring whether they were achieved in relation
to population developments, reproductive health and family planning. According to Murphy (2017), in this period
‘population’ and ‘development’ became political technologies in their own right,
contributing to a larger process of economizing life. At the time, its proponents called
it the ‘largest social science research project ever undertaken’ (in Halfon, 2006: 792). Standards were developed and
implemented across the globe to stabilize measurable phenomena and make them governable.
Halfon nevertheless argues that, despite calling it a ‘consensus document’, consensus did
not mean agreement. Rather, the report operated more like ‘a metaphor for a particularly
robust network, one that allows various actors to act “as if” they were all doing and
thinking the same thing (that is, “as if” there were unity)’ (p. 784). The report achieved
no global consensus, but a new way of overcoming the vivid and fierce disagreement between
different countries (and subgroups within them, not least in the US). New technologies of
large-scale data collection emerged through these initiatives and they have come to play a
central role in contemporary ideas about accountability at both global and national levels
of government.

While Isin and Ruppert (2019)
argue that there might have emerged a distinct data politics of the Global South, we point
to continuities as well as differences both between and within the Global South and the
Global North. We thereby highlight the importance of understanding the pervasiveness of
accountability assemblages in public health globally as well as the need to appreciate the
situatedness and distinct implications of each socio-material setup to create
‘accountability in public health’. There is a continued need for STS work, to hold
accountability assemblages accountable irrespective of where they emerge.

Beyond numbers
The popularity of big data and the datafication of global public health can result in an
elision of analytic attention to how accountability assemblages work through
discursive as well as numerical logics. Data shape but do not determine
political developments (Wyatt,
2008). Numbers tend to be used selectively and, as Adams (2016a) remarks, ‘number crunching and metrics
work as, in their own way, forms of storytelling’ (p. 9). Hoeyer thus describes a public
health accountability assemblage legitimized with reference to the need for numbers and
‘knowledge about what works’, but that invents the numbers it uses to justify the
suggested policies and disregards existing evidence on preventive methods. Cool describes
how the so-called ‘accountability principle’ in European data regulation stimulates
reflections and narrative accounts of responsibility among researchers trying to decide
who they are accountable to and in which way. Data here produces words, as much as the
other way around. Kalender and Holmberg describe the courtesy work needed when researchers
interact with participants in cohort studies and thereby illustrate how even large numbers
emerge through words (see also Ackerman
et al., 2016). A similar point could be made about coding and classification in
most areas of clinical healthcare where health professionals must know how to engage
patients to get the information needed for a diagnosis (Jutel, 2009). Pickersgill provides a telling
example of the way in which numerical forms of evidence have been used strategically to
install and legitimize psychological therapy as standard treatment where pharmaceutical
products used to be the default choice. Here numbers have created a space for words in a
very literal sense.

If accountability is a relationship in which someone can be asked to deliver an account
for something, this can – in principle at least – always take the form of a narrative and
not just numbers (Brenneis,
2006; Riles, 2006),
and taken together these papers illustrate how the implications of datafication are
unpredictable and depend upon much more than what numbers contain and convey.

Coda
Without technologies for data collection and computation, population facts do not exist
(O’Riordan, 2017). It is
through data-saturated and technology-mediated practices that populations are performed (cf.
Law, 2009; Ruppert, 2012). Public health is
accordingly saturated with computational technologies and calculative devices mobilizing and
performing accountability metrics (Callon and Muniesa, 2005). Without ‘population facts’, there are no objects of
accountability for ‘public health’ (here in the meaning of as a state of well-being in a
population). How population facts are produced and used to produce different versions of
accountability therefore deserve continued STS attention. There is not one single process of
‘datafication’ in accountability assemblages, but different systems generating different
objects of concern through different ways of counting and by holding different actors
accountable. These assemblages continue to work through both words and numbers and they are
always materially mediated.

With this volume we therefore hope to stimulate even more empirical studies of the data
politics of accountability in public health. Accountability assemblages serve to establish
responsibilities. Accountability typically ties together group and individual through a
circular movement from the individual to the population and back (Holmberg et al., 2013). This movement depends on
technologies of documentation and computation. It can be opened up and studied. Depending on
differing ideas about who should be held responsible for what – and by whom – different
accountability assemblages emerge along with very different data infrastructures. This
special issue presents some of these differences. It is meant to orient STS towards public
health as a central concern for the discipline, and to show how there is a special role for
STS in holding accountability assemblages accountable.

This special issue grew out of a panel at the 4S/EASST conference in Barcelona. We would
like to thank the contributors and the audience for fruitful discussions, including Klasien
Horstman, Tiago Moreira and Ayo Wahlberg who helped making it a successful event. For
comments on earlier drafts of this introduction we would like to thank Malene Bødker, Linda
Hogle and Francisca Nordfalk.
