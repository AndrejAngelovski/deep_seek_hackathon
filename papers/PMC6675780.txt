cell biology, including cell-to-cell communication, proliferation and
differentiation, survival, and tissue homeostasis, and have been implicated in
various diseases including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Ligand-activated
RTKs recruit adapter proteins through a phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) motif that is
present on the RTK and a p-Tyr-binding domain, like the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain
found in adapter proteins. Notably, numerous combinations of RTK/adapter
combinations exist, making it challenging to compare receptor activities in
standardised assays. In cell-based assays, a regulated adapter recruitment can be
investigated using genetically encoded protein–protein interaction detection
methods, such as the split TEV biosensor assay. Here, we applied the split TEV
technique to robustly monitor the dynamic recruitment of both naturally occurring
full-length adapters and artificial adapters, which are formed of clustered SH2
domains. The applicability of this approach was tested for RTKs from various
subfamilies including the epidermal growth factor (ERBB) family, the insulin
receptor (INSR) family, and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) family.
Best signal-to-noise ratios of ligand-activated RTK receptor activation was obtained
when clustered SH2 domains derived from GRB2 were used as adapters. The sensitivity
and robustness of the RTK recruitment assays were validated in dose-dependent
inhibition assays using the ERBB family-selective antagonists lapatinib and WZ4002.
The RTK split TEV recruitment assays also qualify for high-throughput screening
approaches, suggesting that the artificial adapter may be used as universal adapter
in cell-based profiling assays within pharmacological intervention studies.

Introduction
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are type I transmembrane protein
receptors and respond, with few exceptions, to extracellular cues. RTK-mediated
signalling regulates key processes of cell biology, including intercellular
communication, proliferation and differentiation, cell survival and metabolism, cell
migration, and cell cycle control [1,
2]. Further, RTK signalling is also
implicated in central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS)
development [3]. RTKs share a similar
architecture, which consists of ligand-binding domains in the extracellular region,
a single alpha-helix crossing the membrane and, in the cytoplasm, a juxtamembrane
domain, a protein tyrosine kinase domain, and a carboxyl (C-) terminal regulatory
region [2]. To date, 58 receptor
tyrosine kinases in humans have been described, which can be divided into 20
subfamilies [2]. Together with the G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), RTKs are the most important receptor class in
human cells and represent the most relevant drug targets in the cell [4]. However, only 3% of marketed drugs target
kinases as such, suggesting that the development of cell-based assays with broader
applicability and robustness may contribute to better medicines.

Upon ligand stimulation, RTKs dimerise that causes a kinase
domain-mediated phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic receptor tails in trans, followed by phosphorylation-dependent
recruitment of adapter proteins. The ligand-induced binding between an RTK and an
adapter is commonly mediated by phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) motifs, which are present in
the cytoplasmic tail of an RTK and serve as docking sites for adapter proteins
containing phospho-binding modules, such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain or
phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain [5]. The SH2 domain is the largest class of p-Tyr recognition domains
and comprises 120 different domains in 110 proteins [6]. The specificity of binding between a given SH2 domain and a
p-Tyr docking site is mediated by the SH2 domain itself and the sequence of the
p-Tyr motif, which is defined by the p-Tyr residue and its flanking residues
[7].

One of the best studied RTK families is the Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine
kinases (ERBB) family comprising the epidermal growth factor (EGFR, also known as
HER1 in humans) and ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 (also known as HER2, HER3, and HER4 in
humans). The ERBB family has been linked to the development of, amongst other
tissues, skin, heart, CNS, and PNS, and is widely implicated in human diseases, such
as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia [2, 3]. Upon ligand stimulation, ERBB receptors homo- or heterodimerise,
depending on the cellular context. ERBB2, however, is the preferred dimerisation
partner for the other ERBB receptors and does not respond to ligands [8, 9]. ERBB3 needs to heterodimerise to initiate downstream signalling,
as the kinase domain lacks catalytic activity, and its preferred partner for
heterodimerisation is ERBB2 [10]. The
major ligand for EGFR is the epidermal growth factor (EGF), whereas ERBB3 and ERBB4
are predominantly activated by neuregulins (NRG1-4) [11]. NRG binding to the receptor is mediated by the EGF-like
domain (EGFld), which on its own can stimulate ERBB3 and ERBB4 receptors
[11].

The activity of ERBB receptors can be measured using genetically
encoded bioassays, such as split TEV [12, 13]. This
technique allows assessing dynamic protein–protein interactions in living cells and
is based on the functional complementation of the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease
coupled to genetically encoded reporters, like the GAL4/UAS system combined with
firefly luciferase (Fluc) as reporter gene readout. The assay system was, for
example, applied to monitor phosphorylation-dependent interactions of ERBB4 with the
adapters PIK3R1 (regulatory subunit of PI3K), SHC1, and GRB2, as well as the
EGFld-induced homodimer formation of ERBB4 and the heterodimer formation of ERBB2
and ERBB3 [13–16].

In this work, we describe the application of split TEV-based RTK
recruitment assays that provide a universal adapter recruitment strategy for robust
and flexible cell-based assays applicable to dose–response profiling and
high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. To do this, disease-relevant RTKs such as
the complete ERBB family, the insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and
mesenchymal epithelial transition proto-oncogene (MET, also known as c-MET or
hepatocyte growth factor receptor) were selected and tested in split TEV
dose–response assays for their assay performance, both using endogenous full-length
adapters and artificial adapters consisting of clustered SH2 domains. The latter
ones were designed to increase flexibility, robustness, and eventually lower the
number of adapters needed for assaying various RTK activities, thus improving the
comparability among the receptors tested. Notably, the artificial p-Tyr sensor based
on the SH2 domain clustering derived from GRB2 displayed an improved signal-to-noise
ratio in RTK recruitment assays. Furthermore, the p-Tyr sensor has been validated in
dose–response assays using the ERBB family antagonists lapatinib and WZ4002, as well
as the IGF1R inhibitor linsitinib and the MET antagonist foretinib. As expected,
lapatinib and WZ4002 inhibited ERBB family assays. However, challenging IGF1R and
MET split TEV recruitment assays with lapatinib did not have an effect,
demonstrating the sensitivity of our approach. Taken together, we established robust
split TEV recruitment assays to sensitively monitor RTK receptor activities in
living cells using a universal adapter protein as recruitment sensor.

Materials and methods
Plasmids
ORFs were PCR-amplified using the Pwo proofreading DNA Polymerase
(Roche) and BP-recombined into the pDONR/Zeo plasmid using Gateway recombination
cloning (Life Technologies). Each entry vector was control digested using BsrGI,
which releases the insert, and finally verified by sequencing. LR recombination
that was used to shuffle the ORFs from the entry vectors into the split TEV
destination vectors (either pcDNA_attR1-ORF-attR2-NTEV-tcs-GV-2xHA_DEST or
pcDNA3_attR1-ORF-attR2-CTEV-2xHA_DEST). The generation of the human ORFs for
EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4, SHC1, GRB2, and PIK3R1 has been described previously
[16]. IGF1R and MET were
obtained as pENTR plasmids from Harvard Plasmid ID (clone HsCD00040705) and
Addgene (as part of the CCSB-Broad Human Kinase ORF Collection [17]), respectively. Concatenated ORFs of
clustered SH2 domains that are flanked by attL1 and attL2 sites were synthesised
by GenScript, USA. These sequences were provided in a pUC57 vector backbone
harbouring a kanamycin resistance gene, allowing LR recombination cloning with
destination vectors carrying an ampicillin resistance gene. DNA and protein
sequences of clustered SH2 domains are provided in Fig. S1.

Cell culture
PC12 Tet-Off cells (Clontech, 631134, termed PC12 cells for
simplicity) were maintained in DMEM medium (1 g/l glucose, Lonza) supplemented
with 10% FCS, 5% horse serum (HS, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 100 U/ml each
of penicillin and streptomycin and 2 mM GlutaMAX. To starve PC12 cells, 2% FCS,
100 U/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin and 2 mM GlutaMAX, but no HS, were
added to the DMEM medium (1 g/l glucose). PC12 cells were grown on
poly-l-lysine (Sigma) coated surfaces
for maintenance and experiments. A549 cells (ATCC, CCL-185) were cultured in
DMEM medium (4.5 g/l glucose) supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 U/ml each of
penicillin and streptomycin and 2 mM GlutaMAX. T-47D cells (ATCC, HTB-133) were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with human insulin (f.c. 125 µg/l)
(Sigma-Aldrich), 10% FCS, and 100 U/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin and
2 mM GlutaMAX. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5%
CO2.

Biochemistry
For assessing the phosphorylation levels of EGFR, A549 cells were
starved overnight using 1% FCS, pre-incubated with increasing concentration of
compounds [i.e. lapatinib (Selleckchem) or WZ4002 (Sigma-Aldrich)] at
semi-logarithmic scale for 1 h, and stimulated with 30 ng/ml EGF (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 5 min. Likewise, T-47D were starved overnight using 0.5% FCS, pre-incubated
with increasing concentration of compounds (i.e. lapatinib or WZ4002) at
semi-logarithmic scale for 1 h, and stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF-like domain
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. Split TEV expression plasmids were transfected into
PC12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed 1 × with PBS and lysed in a
Triton-X lysis buffer (1% Triton-X100, 50 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA)
containing the Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and PhosSTOP
phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Briefly, cells were lysed and kept on ice for
10 min, sonicated 3 × for 10 s at 4 °C, and denatured for 10 min at 70 °C. The
Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Electrophoresis System and Trans-Blot Turbo Blotting System
(both Bio-Rad) were used for running and blotting protein gels.
Chemiluminescence detection of proteins by Western blot analysis was performed
using the Western LightningPlus-ECL kit (PerkinElmer). HA-tagged proteins were
visualised using an HA antibody (clone 3F10, dilution 1:250, No. 11 867 423 001,
Roche). The ERBB2-V5 fusion was stained using a V5 antibody (clone D3H8Q,
dilution 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). Phosphorylation levels of EGFR and
ERBB4 were assayed using p-EGFR-Y1068 (clone D7A5, dilution 1:500, No. 3777,
Cell Signaling Technology) and p-ERBB4-Y1284 antibodies (clone 21A9, dilution
1:500, No. 4757, Cell Signaling Technology). Total EGFR and ERBB4 protein levels
were determined using an anti-EGFR antibody (clone A-10, dilution 1:1000,
sc-373746, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-ERBB4 antibody (clone E200,
dilution 1:1000, ab32375, Abcam). Tubulin levels were determined using an
anti-tubulin antibody (dilution 1:2000, No. T 5168, Sigma-Aldrich). For
quantification, phosphorylation levels of p-EGFR relative to EGFR as well as
p-ERBB4 relative to ERBB4 were calculated using the Lukemiller protocol (http://lukemiller.org/index.php/2010/11/analyzing-gels-and-western-blots-with-image-j/). Assays were run in triplicate.

Immunocytochemistry
On day 1, 1 Mio PC12 cells were plated on coverslips coated with
poly-l-lysine (PLL) and placed in a
six-well plate. On day 2, cells were transfected with
EGFR-Glink-NTEV-tevS-GV-2HA, ERBB2-var1-V5, ERBB3-Glink-NTEV-tevS-GV-2HA, or
ERBB4-JMa-CVT1-Glink-NTEV-tevS-GV-2HA using Lipofectamine 2000. On day 3, 50 µl
of 1 × TBS was gently added per coverslip and removed twice to wash the cells,
followed by fixation in 4% PFA diluted in 1 × TBS for 10 min, washed again once
in 1 × TBS and then permeabilised in TBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min.
Subsequently, cells were washed three times with 1 × TBS, then blocked in
blocking buffer (3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 × TBS) for 30 min at room
temperature, and again washed three times with 1 × TBS. The HA antibody
(Poly9023, BioLegend) and the V5 antibody (clone D3H8Q, Cell Signaling
Technology), respectively, were diluted in blocking buffer (1:1000) and added to
the cells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After another three washing steps
using 1 × TBS, the secondary antibody (Alexa 594 anti-rabbit, 1:500, Abcam,
ab150160) diluted in blocking buffer was added to the cells and incubated for
1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times in 1 × TBS, dipped
into ddH2O to remove traces of salt, mounted on
microscope slides, and sealed with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with Dapi
(ThermoFisher Scientific, P36935). Slides were imaged on a Zeiss Observer Z.1
microscope.

Split TEV recruitment end-point assays
Split TEV recruitment assays were run in six replicates per
condition in 96-well plates. 50,000 PC12 cells per well were seeded onto
poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated plates. The
next day, cells were transfected with assay plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000.
For transfection-based assays, no antibiotics were added to the medium. Per
96-well, a receptor-NTEV-tcs-GV fusion plasmid (10 ng), an adapter-CTEV fusion
plasmid for either SHC1 (10 ng), SH2(SHC1) (10 ng), SH2(GRB2) (10 ng), SH2(mix)
(10 ng), PIK3R1(50 ng), SH2(PIK3R1) (50 ng), or GRB2 (2.5 ng), and an Fluc
reporter plasmid (10 ng, Fluc driven by 10x clustered upstream activating
sequences coupled to a minimal CMV promoter, 10 × UAS-minCMVp) were used.
Additionally, 1 ng of a plasmid constitutively expressing an EYFP that is fused
to nuclear localisation sequence (EYFPnuc) driven by a CMV promoter was
transfected per 96-well to assess transfection efficiencies (EYFPnuc). In
detail, assay plasmids were diluted in 30 µl Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), vortexed, and mixed with 0.2 µl Lipofectamine 2000 per well. The
DNA/Lipofectamine/Opti-MEM mix was incubated for 20 min. The medium was removed
from the wells and the DNA/Lipofectamine/Opti-MEM mix was added onto the cells.
After 2 h of incubation, the maintenance medium without antibiotics was added to
the Opti-MEM mix. On day 2, the maintenance medium was replaced by starvation
medium. After 16–20 h (day 3), six wells per condition were stimulated with EGF
(30 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), EGFld (10 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), IGF1 (100 ng/ml,
PeproTech), and HGF (100 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), while six wells were left
non-stimulated. 16 h later (day 4), the medium was removed, and cells were lysed
using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and luciferase activity was analysed using
a dual luciferase assay (Promega) in a Mithras LB 940 Multimode Microplate
Reader (Berthold Technologies). Significance for assays was calculated using an
unpaired t test in GraphPad Prism 5. Error
bars are calculated as standard error of the mean (SEM).

For split TEV recruitment assays in a dose–response format, the
following amendments to the general protocol were made. For a dose–response
assay, all cells on the plate were transfected with the same
receptor-NTEV-tcs-GV and adapter-CTEV fusions, the Fluc reporter plasmid, 1 ng
of a plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase driven by a thymidine kinase promoter, and
the EYFPnuc expressing plasmid. Renilla
luciferase was used to assess toxic effects when applying compounds. For
dose-dependent stimulation testing activation, six wells per condition were
stimulated using increasing concentrations of an agonist at a semi-logarithmic
scale. For assays testing inhibition, cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of an antagonist at a semi-logarithmic scale, followed 1 h later
by the addition of an agonist at a constant concentration. The following
antagonists were used: lapatinib (Selleckchem), WZ4002 (Sigma-Aldrich),
linsitinib (Selleckchem), and foretinib (Selleckchem). Dose–response data were
analysed using the R-based ‘drc’ package, as described before [18, 19]. Error bars are calculated as standard error of the mean
(SEM). For ease of presentation and intuition, we have transformed
conventionally used IC50 values into
pIC50 values [20]. These are calculated from
IC50 values using the formula
pIC50 = − log10(IC50), with
units of molar for IC50 and therefore log(molar) for
pIC50.

Live cell split TEV recruitment assay
To identify an optimal time point of lysis for split TEV
recruitment assays, firefly luciferase expression was continuously monitored
using a 32-channel luminometer (lumicycler 32 by ActiMetrics) for 69 h starting
from the starvation phase. For one assay, 1,000,000 PC12 cells were seeded on a
3.5 cm dish suitable for the instrument. The next day, 100 ng of
receptor-NTEV-tcs-GV, 100 ng of adapter-CTEV, and 100 ng of Fluc reporter
plasmids were transfected using 3.5 µl Lipofectamine 2000 and 1 ml Opti-MEM per
dish. On day 2, cells were starved, and the cell culture medium was supplemented
with 0.1% luciferin (Promega) to monitor firefly luciferase activity in a live
cell setup. The dishes were wrapped with parafilm to avoid excess evaporation of
medium and put into the luminometer, which was placed inside a cell culture
incubator set to 37 °C and 5% CO2. All assays were run
using three replicates per condition.

Results
Design of concatenated SH2 domains as universal adapter for split TEV
recruitment assays
Split TEV assays are based on a TEV protease split into two
inactive fragments, an N-terminal NTEV moiety and a C-terminal CTEV moiety. When
assessing receptor activities, like for RTKs, the receptor is fused to the NTEV
moiety, a TEV cleavage site (tcs), and the artificial co-activator GAL4-VP16
(GV), forming an NTEV-tcs-GV tag. Adapters are fused to CTEV (Fig. 1a). To establish RTK split TEV recruitment
assays that use a universal adapter and are sensitive, robust, and likely reduce
interference with cellular signalling as compared to native adapters, we
designed artificial adapter proteins that only consist of clustered SH2 domains.
The SH2 domain sequences were taken from the human adapter proteins GRB2, SHC1,
and PIK3R1 (Fig. 1b). Notably, these
adapters are known to interact with various RTK subfamilies, including the ERBB
family [2], the INSR family
[21], and the HGFR family
[22]. For the ERBB family, we
had previously developed split TEV recruitment assays using full-length PIK3R1,
GRB2, and SHC1 as adapter proteins [14]. By contrast, each artificial adapter protein was
constructed to contain three concatenated SH2 domains (Fig. 1c, Fig. S1). For artificial GRB2 and SHC1
adapters, the single SH2 domain present in the full protein was concatenated
three times, termed SH2(GRB2) and SH2(SHC1). PIK3R1 contains two SH2 domains, an
N-terminal SH2 domain (SH2-N), and a C-terminal SH2 domain (SH2-C). For the
artificial adapter, two concatenated SH2-N domains were linked to a single SH2-C
domain, termed SH2(PIK3R1). We also designed a chimeric protein adapter molecule
containing one SH2 domain of each GRB2, SHC1, and the N-terminal SH2 domain of
PIK3R1, termed SH2(mix). SH2 domains were separated via a flexible GS-linker
formed of glycine, serine, and threonine residues (GGGGSTGGGGS) to allow for
optimal folding and flexibility of binding.Fig. 1 Design of a versatile split TEV recruitment assay for
receptor tyrosine kinases. a
Scheme of the split TEV recruitment assay for receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs). RTKs are fused to an NTEV moiety along with a
TEV protease cleavage site (tcs) and an artificial
co-transcriptional activator GAL4-VP16 (GV). Adapter proteins
are fused to CTEV. Upon activation by a specific ligand (1), the
RTK dimerises, is cross-phosphorylated by the kinase domains at
Tyr residues, providing docking sites for adapter proteins that
bind to phosphorylated tyrosines (2). The ligand-induced
interaction between RTK and adapter causes the NTEV and CTEV
moieties to form a reconstituted TEV protease (2). Reconstituted
TEV protease cleaves at tcs to release GV (3). Liberated GV
migrates to the nucleus and initiates expression of firefly
luciferase (Fluc) (4). b Domain

The concatenated SH2(GRB2) domain is a universal adapter for RTK split TEV
recruitment assays
For RTK split TEV recruitment assays, receptors were fused to the
NTEV moiety along with tcs and GV, yielding RTK-NTEV-tcs-GV fusion proteins. As
receptors, we selected EGFR, ERBB3, and ERBB4 of the ERBB family, IGF1R of the
INSR family and MET of the HGFR family. Adapter proteins were fused to the CTEV
moiety. HTS-compatible split TEV recruitment assays are performed using an
end-point format (Fig. S2). Therefore, we first evaluated the optimal time point
for this type of a split TEV assay. To do this, we monitored luciferase activity
in a live cell split TEV recruitment assay using ERBB4 and PIK3R1, which has
been used before in a compound screen [16]. ERBB4-NTEV-tcs-GV was transfected together with
PIK3R1-CTEV and the Fluc reporter into PC12 cells, which were starved to reduce
baseline activity, and thus enable proper stimulation by EGFld. The best
stimulation to baseline ratio was obtained 16 h after stimulation (Fig. S3).
Hence, all RTK split TEV recruitment assays using an end-point format were
performed accordingly. To obtain a most sensitive adapter for RTK split TEV
recruitment assays, we compared the performance of established full-length
adapters versus artificial domain adapters. First, we monitored the induced
activity of EGFR, ERBB3 (as heterodimerisation with ERBB2), and ERBB4 using the
three full-length adapters GRB2, SHC1, and PIK3R1, as well as the SH2 domain
adapters SH2(GRB2), SH2(SHC1), SH2(PIK3R1), and SH2(mix) in PC12 cells
(Fig. 2, Table S1). In these assays,
EGFR activity was stimulated using EGF, whereas ERBB3 and ERBB4 activity was
stimulated using EGFld. Notably, fold changes using the SH2(GRB2) domain adapter
scored highest for all ERBB receptor assays tested. Constitutive control
Renilla luciferase readings remained
stable for these assays (Fig. S4). In addition, various non-titrated amounts of
transfected adapter plasmids that resulted in different expression lead to
similar activation profiles of receptors, indicating that split TEV recruitment
assays are robust and tolerate substantial differences in transfected adapter
plasmids (Fig. S5). A live cell split TEV recruitment assay using ERBB4 and the
SH2(GRB2) domain showed comparable kinetics to the ERBB4/PIK3R1 assay,
indicating that the readout is stable over several hours (Fig. S3).Fig. 2 Comparing adapter protein performance for split TEV
recruitment assays to monitoring ERBB receptor activities. Split
TEV recruitment assays for ERBB family receptors. EGFR
(a), ERBB2/ERBB3 (c), and ERBB4 (e) activities were assessed in PC12 cells using
EGF to stimulate EGFR, and EGF-like domain (EGFld) to stimulate
ERBB3 and ERBB4. For split TEV assays, the indicated receptor
fusions were transfected together with indicated adapters that
were fused to the CTEV moiety. Note that for the ERBB2/ERBB3
assay (c), ERBB2 is
co-transfected to allow heterodimerisation and thus ERBB3
phosphorylation, which is required for the recruitment of
adapters. Assays were stimulated for 16 h and analysed by a
firefly luciferase assay. Non-stimulated samples are shown as
open bars and stimulated ones as grey bars. FC fold change, Ctrl control (no adapter

and ERBB4 (f) (all tagged with
NTEV-tcs-GV-2HA), ERBB2-V5 (d),
and adapter proteins (all tagged with CTEV-2HA) were transiently
transfected into PC12 cells, allowed to express for 16 h, and
lysed. Lysates were subjected to Western blotting using the
indicated antibodies. Calculated sizes of fusion proteins are
provided in Table S1. Arrow indicates bands of artificial
adapter fusions. Note that SH2(PIK3R1) is only very weakly
expressed



Then, we assessed whether RTK split TEV recruitment assays using
full-length adapters and SH2 domain adapters can also be used to monitor the
activity of RTKs that belong to other subfamilies. To do this, we selected IGF1R
and MET that belong to INSR and HGFR families, respectively. Indeed, activation
of IGF1R (using the ligand IGF1) and MET (using the ligand HGF) was robustly
monitored using the SH2(GRB2) domain adapter, suggesting that the artificial
adapter formed of three SH2(GRB2) domains serves as a universal adapter in split
TEV recruitment assays (Fig. 3, Fig.
S4). A Western blot analysis validates that the RTK-NTEV-tcs-GV fusion proteins
for EGFR, ERBB3, ERBB4, IGF1R and MET (each harbouring an HA tag at the
C-terminus) and all adapter-CTEV fusion proteins (each also harbouring an HA tag
at the C-terminus) were correctly expressed at expected sizes in PC12 cells
(Figs. 2b, d, f, 3b, d, Table S2). For the ERBB3 split TEV
recruitment assay, a non-TEV-tagged, but V5-tagged ERBB2 was co-transfected to
enable ligand-induced phosphorylation of ERBB3, and successively, formation of
p-Tyr docking sites (Fig. 2d). Using
immunocytochemistry, the proper expression of the RTK-NTEV-tcs-GV fusions was
corroborated, as all RTK fusion proteins were enriched at the cell surface in
PC12 cells (Fig. S6).Fig. 3 Comparing adapter protein performance for split TEV

Next, we validated the sensitivity of RTK split TEV recruitment
assays using the SH2(GRB2) adapter in agonist dose–response assays using
increasing concentrations of the respective agonists (Fig. 4, Fig. S7). For ERBB recruitment assays, the
SH2(SHC1) and SH2(mix) adapters showed, compared to the SH2(GRB2) adapter, lower
signal-to-noise ratios and reduced sensitivity in dose–response assays
(Fig. 4a–c, Figs. S7, S8). Notably,
agonist dose–response split TEV recruitment assays for both IGF1R and MET and
applying the SH2(GRB2) adapter also resulted in robust dose-dependent increases
of receptor activity (Fig. 4d, e, Fig.
S7). Taken together, we identified the three times concatenated SH2 domain of
GRB2, termed SH2(GRB2), as universal adapter for our set of selected RTK
receptor split TEV recruitment assays.Fig. 4 The concatenated SH2(GRB2) domain fusion is a universal
adapter to profile ERBB, IGF1R, and MET activities. Split TEV

V5-tagged ERBB2) plasmid was co-transfected with the
SH2(GRB2)-CTEV adapter plasmid into PC12 cells. Error bars are
shown as SEM, with six replicates per condition



The SH2(GRB2) universal adapter efficiently monitors lapatinib inhibition
across all ERBB family receptors
Cell-based assays are frequently used to assess a compound’s
potential to inhibit the activity of a given receptor, such as for an RTK
[23]. To measure the impact of
inhibitory compounds on RTK targets using our split TEV recruitment assays, we
challenged them with the well-characterised pan-ERBB family inhibitor lapatinib
that is used in the clinic [24] and
determined IC50 values for each assay (Fig. 5a–f, Figs. S9, S10). For a more intuitive
comparison among assays, we transformed IC50 values into
pIC50 values reflecting a logarithmic scale (see
“Materials and methods” for details)
(Fig. 5f, Table S3). When compared
across ERBB receptor assays using both full-length and SH2 domain adapters,
split TEV recruitment assays using the universal adapter SH2(GRB2) are most
sensitive to lapatinib inhibition (Fig. 5f). The constitutive Renilla luciferase readout enabled us to discriminate between
inhibitory and toxic effects, with the latter ones only occurring at 30 µM
lapatinib (Fig. S9). We found in our assays using the SH2(GRB2) adapter that
lapatinib efficiently inhibits EGFR (IC50: 305 nM,
pIC50: 6.52) and ERBB2/ERBB3
(IC50: 72 nM, pIC50: 7.14),
and ERBB4 (IC50: 166 nM, pIC50:
6.78). However, lapatinib treatment did not inhibit IGF1R and MET activities
(Fig. 5d, e, Fig. S9). In
concordance with the literature, stimulated IGF1R and MET receptors were
efficiently inhibited by linsitinib and foretinib, respectively (Fig. S9)
[25, 26]. To further compare the sensitivity of
our split TEV RTK recruitment assays with cellular assays that use
phospho-specific antibodies to monitor RTK activity, we explored the potency of
EGFR and ERBB4 inhibition by lapatinib by assessing the phosphorylation levels
of EGFR in A549 cells and of ERBB4 in T-47D cells. Both cell lines are of human
origin and reasonably express EGFR and ERBB4, respectively. Dose-dependent
addition of lapatinib led to an efficient inhibition of p-EGFR and p-ERBB4, as
revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 5g–j,
Fig. S11). Quantification of our Western blotting data indicate that EGFR and
ERBB4 are inhibited by lapatinib at similar concentrations in cellular assays
when comparing antibody-based detection of phosphorylation levels and split
TEV-based RTK recruitment assays. By contrast, a biochemical kinome profiling
study reported that both EGFR (2.4 nM, kD) and ERBB2 (7 nM, kD) are more
potently inhibited than ERBB4 (54 nM, kD) [27]. In support of our findings, data from published cellular
assays, which use lysates as input for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA) and applied phospho-specific antibodies as sensor of receptor activity,
reported a similar range of concentrations for IC50
values of EGFR and ERBB2 inhibition, suggesting that efficiencies may
substantially vary between biochemical and cell-based assays (Table 1, Table S4) [24, 27–29]. Taken together, our own data obtained from the split TEV
recruitment assays indicate that lapatinib efficiently inhibits ERBB receptors,
with preferentially inhibiting ERBB2/ERBB3 (72 nM, IC50)
and ERBB4 (166 nM, IC50) over EGFR (305 nM,
IC50).Fig. 5 The universal SH2(GRB2) adapter displays the highest

To corroborate the use of our cell-based assays using the split TEV
recruitment technique and the SH2(GRB2) adapter, we also tested the pan-ERBB
inhibitor WZ4002 (Table 1, Table S5)
[30, 31]. By performing antagonistic
dose–response assays for WZ4002, we could confirm the usage of SH2(GRB2) as a
universal adapter in ERBB split TEV recruitment assays. In split TEV assays,
WZ4002 efficiently inhibited ERBB family receptors EGFR, ERBB3, and ERBB4
(Fig. 6a–c). Dose-dependent addition
of WZ4002 to A549 and T-47D cells reduced phospho-levels of EGFR and ERBB4 to
similar levels when compared to split TEV recruitment assays, as quantification
of phospho-EGFR and phospho-ERBB4 indicates (Fig. 6d–g, Fig. S11). Further, we tested whether spironolactone
exerts antagonistic effects on ERBB family receptors as recently reported
[16]. Spironolactone is a
pan-ERBB inhibitor, displaying selectivity for ERBB4 over EGFR, as previously
determined using a split TEV dimerisation assay. Spironolactone also inhibited
ERBB activities using the universal SH2(GRB2) adapter in the split TEV
recruitment assays, with some selectivity for ERBB4 over EGFR (Fig. S12).
Further, the spironolactone metabolite canrenone did not exhibit any
antagonistic effects on any ERBB assay, which is also consistent with our
previous findings [16] (Fig. S12).
In summary, these data suggest that the adapter SH2(GRB2) can be used in split
TEV recruitment assays to monitor both agonist and antagonist actions targeting
the RTK ERBB family in living cells.Fig. 6 The ERBB family antagonist WZ4002 inhibits split TEV

Discussion
We describe a genetically encoded split TEV recruitment assay to
monitor RTK activities using a universal adapter that consists of three concatenated
SH2 domains, which bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues. As examples for RTKs,
we have selected the ERBB receptor family, IGF1R of the INSR family, and MET of the
HGFR family. We tested full-length adapters GRB2, SHC1, and PIK3R1, as well as
artificially constructed adapters consisting of concatenated SH2 domains of GRB2,
SHC1, and PIK3R1 for efficient assay performance upon RTK receptor stimulation
(Fig. 1). The adapter formed of three
concatenated SH2 domains of GRB2, SH2(GRB2) displayed the best signal-to-noise ratio
across all RTK biosensor assays tested (Figs. 2, 3), and the
performance of this adapter was further validated in dose–response assays
(Fig. 4). In addition, the SH2(GRB2)
adapter was characterised in antagonist dose–response assays by applying the ERBB
family inhibitors lapatinib, WZ4002, and spironolactone (Figs. 5, 6, Fig.
S12).

SH2(GRB2) as a universal adapter for RTK activity measurement
For integrating cell-based assays into HTS, an appropriate
signal-to-noise ratio is key to robustness [23, 32].
Therefore, the SH2(GRB2) adapter represents a universal approach towards HTS
assays. In agreement, the SH2 domain of GRB2 was reported to bind all members of
the ERBB family in a biochemical study using protein microarrays, supporting our
findings of SH2(GRB2) as universal adapter [33]. The SH2 domain of GRB2 was also applied as p-Tyr sensor
in living cells, where the SH2 domain was fused to the photoactivatable
fluorescent protein tdEos to monitor EGFR activation [34]. Furthermore, full-length GRB2 has been
shown to stronger bind to p-Tyr motifs present in EGFR and ERBB4 when compared
to SHC1, suggesting that the SH2 domain of GRB2 is a better fit for a universal
adapter in split TEV recruitment assays [35]. The general consensus sequence of the p-Tyr motifs that
the SH2 domain of GRB2 binds to was initially described as pY-X-N [36]. However, a more recent study expanded
this view to a more general consensus sequence pY-[ϕ/Q]-[NQFDK], where ϕ stands
for a hydrophobic residue [35],
supporting the notion that the SH2 domain of GRB2 can bind to p-Tyr motifs with
a rather flexible sequence. As the SH2 domain adapter only consists of SH2
domains and no other interaction modules are present in this adapter, this
artificial adapter may solely function as a p-Tyr sensor [37]. Furthermore, the SH2(GRB2) adapter may
be used for monitoring activities of other RTKs, such as the insulin growth
factor receptor and tropomyosin receptor kinase families that also bind GRB2,
potentially expanding the number of receptors [38, 39]. The
split TEV recruitment assays presented are based on transient transfections and
thus use overexpressed receptors and adapters. Therefore, we would like to
emphasise that RTK split TEV recruitment assays were specifically designed to
assay receptor activities in heterologous cells, and these assays may not be
combined with analyses of downstream signalling [40]. As heterologous cells display abnormal activities of
downstream signalling, events of cellular signalling should preferably be
monitored in primary cell types. By contrast, activities of receptors may well
be studied in heterologous cell lines, as studying receptor activities
implicates the first step of a signalling cascade [23].

When RTKs become activated, the phosphorylation of intracellular
tyrosine residues represents the first step upon ligand binding. Notably,
different agonist ligands and varying concentrations thereof may cause diverse
cellular outcomes, as for example described for EGFR ligands that differentially
affect EGFR endocytosis and recycling [41]. Thus, it is of common interest to specify which of these
tyrosine residues of an RTK are phosphorylated and act as docking sites for
adapter proteins to initiate signalling [42]. Alternatively, phosphorylated docking sites may act
additively to elicit a response by recruiting a defined set of adapters
[43]. To understand which
phospho-signature is generated by a given RTK, e.g. after agonist or antagonist
treatment, full-length adapters as well as SH2 domain adapters may be used for
profiling of biased adapter recruitment. In our split TEV recruitment assays,
EGFR activation, for example, can be detected at very low EGF concentrations
using the GRB2 full-length protein as adapter (Fig. S8). By contrast, when
treating ERBB3 with the antagonist lapatinib, full-length PIK3R1 proved to be
the most sensitive adapter protein to measure an inhibition (Fig. 5f, Fig. S10). The adapter SH2(GRB2) does not
cover aspects of biased signalling per se, but can be used as universal adapter
to study RTK activity profiles. Assessing differential binding properties may be
important, as adapters have varying binding affinities to activated receptors
and binding affinities depend on ligand concentrations [44]. Likewise, receptors can recruit
distinct sets of adapter proteins to initiate specific downstream signalling
[45]. Thus, the SH2(GRB2)
adapter may be used for a primary assessment of RTK activity in recruitment
assays, followed by more specialised assays (e.g. using other adaptors in split
TEV recruitment assays or cell-based assays using phospho-antibodies) to
determine signalling fate.

In addition, usage of the universal adapter is not restricted to
split TEV-based recruitment assays, but can be implemented into all genetically
encoded recruitment assays that, for example, rely on the complementation of a
reporter protein, the release of an artificial transcription factor, or both.
For example, split green fluorescent protein (GFP) assays (and derivatives)
[46, 47], split firefly luciferase [48], split ubiquitin [49], and full-TEV protease assays
[50] may be applicable.
Furthermore, the SH2(GRB2) adapter may also be used in fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer
(BRET)-based assays [51,
52]. Taken together, the
universal SH2(GRB2) adapter represents a p-Tyr biosensor to monitor RTK
activities and may be used in various cell-based assays that are genetically
encoded.

Lapatinib preferentially inhibits ERBB4 over EGFR in RTK/SH2 adapter
recruitment assays
Lapatinib, an EGFR and ERBB2 receptor inhibitor, is used in the
clinics, e.g. in combination therapies to treat cancers [53, 54]. It has been shown that lapatinib also inhibits ERBB3 and
ERBB4 receptors in biochemical profiling studies [27]. Compared to data obtained from biochemical assays,
IC50 concentrations for lapatinib were substantially
higher in cell-based assays [24,
27, 28] (Table 1, Table S4), suggesting that efficiencies of compounds in
living cells cannot be precisely predicted from biochemical data. Thus,
compounds should be efficiently tested in cell-based assays that best reflect
the nature or the target or, in the case of a disease-linked phenotype, most
faithfully replicate the disease state [23]. Furthermore, antagonistic preferences of a given target
over related targets, a feature important for characterising selectivity of a
compound, may vary between biochemical and cell-based assays, supporting the
notion of applying the most appropriate test system possible.

Profiling multiple RTK activities simultaneously using multiplexed
cell-based assays
The abnormal activities of RTKs are linked to the pathophysiology
of various human diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, inflammation,
angiogenesis, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders
[2, 3]. Therefore, these associations have
initiated the development of drugs that block or attenuate aberrant activity of
RTKs. However, many available drugs targeting RTKs lack selectivity,
demonstrating the medical need for the development of better drugs. The need for
more specific drugs is also reflected by the fact that only 3% of all marketed
drugs target kinases including RTKs [4]. Cell-based profiling techniques that enable the
simultaneous analysis of multiple targets and allow defining selectivity of a
given compound will contribute to the development of better drugs [12]. For example, multiplexed cell-based
assays that rely on complementation of a reporter, the release of an artificial
transcription factor, and the use of barcoded RNA sequences as reporters can be
applied to profile activities of disease-relevant targets, as we have recently
shown for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [40]. Therefore, using the split TEV recruitment assay and
integrating the universal SH2(GRB2) adapter may represent a promising approach
to build a technology platform to assess RTK activities in early drug discovery
to finally improve compound selectivity.
