Following the concept of conformationally restriction of ligands to achieve high receptor affinity, we exploited the propellane system as rigid scaffold allowing the stereodefined attachment of various substituents. Three types of ligands were designed, synthesized and pharmacologically evaluated as σ1 receptor ligands. Propellanes with (1) a 2-methoxy-5-methylphenylcarbamate group at the “left” five-membered ring and various amino groups on the “right” side; (2) benzylamino or analogous amino moieties on the “right” side and various substituents at the left five-membered ring and (3) various urea derivatives at one five-membered ring were investigated. The benzylamino substituted carbamate syn,syn-4a showed the highest σ1 affinity within the group of four stereoisomers emphasizing the importance of the stereochemistry. The cyclohexylmethylamine 18 without further substituents at the propellane scaffold revealed unexpectedly high σ1 affinity (Ki = 34 nM) confirming the relevance of the bioisosteric replacement of the benzylamino moiety by the cyclohexylmethylamino moiety. Reduction of the distance between the basic amino moiety and the “left” hydrophobic region by incorporation of the amino moiety into the propellane scaffold resulted in azapropellanes with particular high σ1 affinity. As shown for the propellanamine 18, removal of the carbamate moiety increased the σ1 affinity of 9a (Ki = 17 nM) considerably. Replacement of the basic amino moiety by H-bond forming urea did not lead to potent σ ligands. According to molecular dynamics simulations, both azapropellanes anti-5 and 9a as well as propellane 18 adopt binding poses at the σ1 receptor, which result in energetic values correlating well with their different σ1 affinities. The affinity of the ligands is enthalpy driven. The additional interactions of the carbamate moiety of anti-5 with the σ1 receptor protein cannot compensate the suboptimal orientations of the rigid propellane and its N-benzyl moiety within the σ1 receptor-binding pocket, which explains the higher σ1 affinity of the unsubstituted azapropellane 9a.

1. Introduction

In 1976, Martin and coworkers [1] postulated σ receptors as the third type of opioid receptors. The name σ receptor was derived from the benzomorphan SKF-10,047, which caused a unique pharmacological profile in animal studies. Twenty years later, the σ1 receptor was cloned from different tissues of different speces [2,3,4,5,6]. Subsequently, several models of the structure of the σ1 receptor were reported, until it was crystallized in 2016, confirming its unique structure [7,8]. The identification of the σ2 receptor took an even longer time. In 2017, the identity of the σ2 receptor and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97) was shown [9,10]. Very recently, the first structure of the human σ2 receptor was reported. [11]

The σ1 receptor is involved in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression [12,13,14,15,16]. Several clinically used antidepressants show medium to high σ1 receptor affinity in addition to their main mechanism of action [17,18,19,20]. σ1 receptors also play a role in drug/alcohol dependence and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) [21,22,23]. The σ1 receptor antagonist S1RA has been successfully tested in phase II clinical studies for the treatment of neuropathic pain [24,25]. Since the exact signal transduction path of σ1 receptors is not fully understood so far, analgesic activity in neuropathic pain mouse models is the best method to discriminate σ1 receptor antagonists from agonists [26,27]. Several human tumors, including prostate, breast and bladder tumors, express a high density of σ1 receptors. Strong metastasis and poor prognosis were associated with high expression levels of σ1 receptors. Antagonists at σ1 receptors were able to reduce tumor cell proliferation [28,29]. Several human tumor cells derived from various tissues (e.g., prostate, breast, colon and lung) overexpress σ2 receptors. Agonists at the σ2 receptor are capable of killing tumor cells via apoptotic and non-apoptotic machanisms [30,31,32,33,34].

The structures of σ1 and σ2 receptor ligands are quite diverse. Some prototypical σ ligands containing highly flexible structural elements are displayed in Figure 1. Binding of flexible ligands to a biological target is associated with an entropic penalty, since the binding site of the target forces the flexible ligand into a particular conformation leading to loss of conformational freedom of the ligand.

We are interested in rather rigid ligands with a defined three-dimensional structure fitting exactly into the binding pocket of the target protein. In this respect, we reported on spiro- and bicyclic ligands with high affinity and selectivity for σ1 receptors. As an example, the spirocyclic piperidine derivative (S)-fluspidine (1) is depicted in Figure 2 [35,36,37,38]. (S)-Fluspidine (1) interacts with low nanomolar affinity with σ1 receptors and shows 300-fold selectivity against the σ2 subtype. The 18-F-labeled analog [18F]1 is currently investigated as the PET tracer for imaging of σ1 receptors in the brain of patients suffering from major depression [39]. The piperazine derivative 2 rigidified by a propano bridge exhibits even higher σ1 affinity than 1 and more than 40-fold selectivity over the σ2 receptor [40]. On the other hand, the rigid granatane derivative 3 reported by Mach and coworkers [41] represents a ligand with a 30-fold preference for the σ2 receptor. (Figure 2)

Inspired by these conformationally restricted spiro- and bicyclic σ ligands 1–3 we introduced the propellane as novel rigid scaffold to achieve high σ1 and/or σ2 receptor affinity. With Ki values of 77 nM and 82 nM the [4.3.3]propellane syn,syn-4a [42] and the 3-aza[4.4.3]propellane anti-5 [43] represent promising σ1 receptor ligands. (Figure 2)

Herein, we started further exploiting the propellane system as rigid scaffold to attach various functional groups and substituents, designed to address σ1 and/or σ2 receptors. (Figure 3) Due to the rigid structure of the propellane scaffold, all substituents adopt an exact orientation. The manuscript contains three parts. In the first part (compounds of type A), the carbamate at the “left” part of the propellane system was kept constant and the substituent at the second cyclopentane ring was modified (compare substituents of granatane 3). The second part deals predominantly with propellanes of type B containing an arylmethylamino moiety (and analogous amino groups) at the “right” side of the propellane system and variations of the “left” side. The third part investigated, whether the amino moiety on the “right” side could be replaced bioisosterically by a urea moiety as shown for compounds of type C. The urea is not basic, but represents a strong H-bond donor and acceptor.

2. Chemistry

The synthesis of the carbamates 4 started with the mixture of the diastereomeric hydroxyketones anti-6 and syn-6 [42], which was reacted with 2-methoxy-5-methylphenyl isocyanate in the presence of,Bu2Sn(OAc)2. The carbamates anti-7 and syn-7 were isolated in 36% and 31% yield, respectively. (Scheme 1) The X-ray crystal structure of syn-7 confirmed the successful formation of the carbamate and its syn-configuration at 8-position (Figure 4). Moreover, the very long conjoining C–C bond, which belongs to all three rings of the propellane, was confirmed by the crystal structure (C1–C6 = 1.562(2) Å). Final reductive amination of the ketones anti-7 and syn-7 with primary amines and NaBH(OAc)3 [44] provided the amines 8-anti-4 and 8-syn-4. Both type of compounds were obtained as mixture of diastereomers. The ratio of diastereomers was approximately 1:1, respectively.

The affinity of this first set of propellanylcarbamates 4 and 5 towards σ1 and σ2 receptors was determined in receptor binding studies. In these experiments, the test compounds compete with a radioligand for a limited amount of receptors. The tritium-labeled radioligands [3H]-(+)-pentazocine and [3H]-di-o-tolylguanidine were used in the σ1 and σ2 assay, respectively [45,46,47]. The affinity data of the propellanylcarbamates are summarized in Table 1.

The group of diastereomeric benzylamines 4a show nicely the relationship between the stereochemistry and the σ1 and σ2 receptor affinity. Whereas the 8-anti-derivatives anti,anti-4a and anti,syn-4a exhibit very low σ1 affinity, the 8-syn-derivatives are much more potent and syn,syn-4a shows the highest σ1 affinity within the four diastereomeres (Ki = 77 nM). Although the granatane derivative 3 reveals high σ2 affinity the diastereomeric propellane derivatives 4a with the same substitution pattern did not interact with σ2 receptors up to a concentration of 1 µM [42].

Introduction of various substituents (OCH3, Cl, CH3, CF3, NO2, and NMe2) at various positions of the benzyl moiety (8-anti-1b-1h) did not lead to remarkable σ1 or σ2 affinity. The furan-2-yl and indol-3-yl derivatives 8-anti-4i and 8-anti-4k show σ1 affinity in the range of Ki = 1 µM. The corresponding 8-syn-derivatives 8-syn-4i and 8-syn-4k reveal higher σ1 affinity than their 8-anti-analogs. The highest σ1 affinity of propellanes bearing a hetarylmethyl moiety was found for the furan-2-yl derivative 8-syn-4i (Ki = 276 nM).

Removal or extension of the benzyl-CH2 moiety provided (substituted) aniline 8-anti-4l -4o or homologous phenylethylamine and phenylpropylamine derivatives 8-anti-4p and 8-anti-4q. However, neither removal nor extension of the benzyl-CH2 moiety led to considerable σ1 or σ2 affinity. Only the phenylethylamine derivative 8-anti-4p shows σ1 affinity in the high nanomolar range (Ki = 668 nM).

With exception of the 5-hydroxypentyl derivative 8-anti-4t (Ki(σ1) = 454 nM), propellane derivatives with a substituted alkylamino moiety in 11-position (8-anti-4r-4u) show only negligible affinity towards both σ receptor subtypes.

Introduction of the basic amino moiety into the propellane scaffold led to a reduced distance between the basic amino moiety and the carbamate group of the aza-propellanes 5. The aza-propellane anti-5 displays σ1 affinity, which is comparable with the σ1 affinity of syn,syn-4a.43 It has to be noted that the stereodescriptors change due to a change of the hierarchy of the three rings by expansion of one cyclopentane moiety into a piperidine ring. Thus, the three-dimensional structure of syn,syn-4a corresponds to that of anti-5, which explains the similar σ1 affinity (Ki = 77 nM and 82 nM) [43].

In the second part of the manuscript, the focus lies on propellanes containing arylmethylamino moieties on the “right” side and various substituents on the “left” side. Although the synthesis of benzylamine 8 (Figure 5) has already been reported in literature [48], its affinity towards σ receptors is missing. The 3-azapropellanes 9 (Figure 5) show promising σ1 affinity, which depends on the substitution pattern and the configuration.43 Therefore, we decided to investigate the σ receptor affinity of the benzylamine 8 and modify the substituents in the 11-position.

At first, the ketones 10–12 were reductively aminated with benzylamine and NaBH(OAc)344 to yield the benzylamines 8, 13 and 14. The pure diastereomeric alcohols anti-11 and syn-11 were converted separately into the benzylamines 11-anti-13 and 11-syn-13, respectively, which were not further separated. Whereas the syn- and anti-configured benzylamines 8 were also not separated, the diastereomeric 1,3-dioxolanes 14 were separated by flash chromatography to obtain diastereomerically pure 8-anti-14 and 8-syn-14. (Scheme 2).

Furthermore, the unsubstituted ketone 10 was reductively aminated with tryptamine to yield the indolylethylamine 15. The mixture of diastereomeric benzylamines anti-8 and syn-8 was treated with ammonium formate and Pd(OH)2 removing reductively the benzyl moiety. Upon treatment with aldehydes and NaBH(OAc)3 [44], the resulting primary amine 16 was further transformed into the dimethylamino substituted benzylamine 17 and the cyclohexylmethylamine 18. (Scheme 2).

The σ1 affinity of the 3-azapropellane anti-9b with an OH moiety at 12-position is three-fold higher than the σ1 affinity of its syn-diastereomer syn-9b. (Table 2) However, the low nanomolar σ1 affinity of the unsubstituted 3-azapropellane 9a (Ki = 17 nM) was unexpected.42,43,48 Compared to the naked azapropellane 9a, the σ1 affinity of the naked propellanamine 8 is 35-fold reduced. The 3-azapropellanes 9a and anti-9b and the naked propellanamine 8 show at least 10-fold selectivity for the σ1 receptor over the σ2 receptor. The least potent σ1 ligand syn-9b has only a slight preference for the σ1 receptor over the σ2 subtype (Table 2).

Modifications of the 11-substituent and the N-substituent led to propellanamines 13–17 with very low σ1 and σ2 affinity. However, the cyclohexylmethyl moiety increased the σ1 and the σ2 affinity remarkably. With Ki values of 24 nM (σ1 affinity) and 101 nM (σ2 affinity), 18 represents the most potent σ ligand of this series of compounds. The increase of both σ1 and σ2 affinities by introduction of the cyclohexylmethyl moiety instead of the benzyl moiety has already been observed for some other classes of σ ligands [49,50].

In the third part of this project, the amino moiety on the “right” side was replaced by a urea to investigate, whether this H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor group could mimic the basic amino moiety. For this purpose, the propellane-8,11-dione 19 was reductively aminated with benzylamine. The resulting secondary amines syn-20 and anti-20 were separated by flash column chromatography and subsequently reacted with 2-methoxy-5-methylphenyl isocyanate to obtain the urea derivatives syn-21 and anti-21, respectively. Final reduction of the ketones syn-21 and anti-21 with NaBH4 provided the four diastereomeric N-benzylurea derivatives syn,anti-22, syn,syn-22, anti,anti-22 and anti,syn-22 bearing a secondary alcohol in 11-position (Scheme 3).

The N-benzylurea derivatives anti-21, syn,anti-22 and anti,syn-22 were crystallized from EtOAc, leading to crystals suitable for X-ray crystal structure analysis. (Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8).

The crystal structure of anti-21 nicely confirms the anticonfiguration of the urea at the propellane system. The conjoining bond C1–C6 is rather long (1.550(3) Å). The cyclohexane ring adopts a chair conformation and the cyclopentane ring bearing the urea adopts an envelope conformation, which leads to an outward orientation of the large urea (Figure 6).

The X-ray crystal structures of the diastereomeric N-benzylurea derivatives syn,anti-22 and anti,syn-22 containing an additional OH moiety in 11-position are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8. Both structures prove the syn,anti- and anti,syn-configuration, respectively. The six-membered ring of the propellane scaffold of syn,anti-22 adopts a chair conformation. However, in the diastereomer anti,syn-22 a boat-like conformation was found for the cyclohexane ring. This boat-like conformation leads to an extraordinarily long conjoining bond (C1–C6 = 1.590(2) Å). Both five-membered rings of urea derivative anti,syn-22 adopt unusual envelope conformations and all three rings of the propellane scaffold flap in the same direction (Figure 8). This pattern was only reported for heterocyclic 8,11-dioxa[4.3.3]propellanes [51].

To obtain urea derivatives without the N-benzyl substituent, the primary amine 16 was reacted with various isocyanates. Since the primary amine 16 was employed as 1.1-mixture of anti- and syn-diastereomers, the urea derivatives 23a–d were obtained as 1:1-mixture of anti- and syn-diastereomers as well (Scheme 4).

Finally, the dioxolane substituted benzylamine 14 (mixture of syn- and anti-diastereomers) was debenzylated by a transfer hydrogenolysis using NH4HCO2 in the presence of Pd(OH)2. The mixture of diastereomeric primary amines 24 was isolated in 75% yield and converted into urea upon treatment with 3,4-difluorophenyl isocyanate. After hydrolysis of the dioxolane, the diastereomeric difluorophenylurea derivatives syn-25 and anti-25 were isolated in 42% and 35% yield, respectively. Reduction of the ketones syn-25 and anti-25 with NaBH4 provided diastereomeric alcohols 26. Whereas the mixture of syn,anti-26 and syn,syn-26 was obtained as 1:1-mixture of diastereomers, anti,anti-26 and anti,syn-26 were separated by flash chromatography (Scheme 5).

The syn-configuration of syn-25 was confirmed unequivocally by X-ray crystal structure analysis. In addition to the syn-configuration the chair conformation of the cyclohexane ring and the long conjoining bond C1–C6 = 1.546(3) Å was demonstrated (Figure 9).

The σ1 and σ2 affinities of the urea derivatives were determined in receptor binding studies. Unfortunately, the synthesized urea were not able to compete with the radioligands proving that the urea could not replace bioisosterically the basic amino moiety (Table 3).

3. Computational Studies

Within the class of propellanamines and azapropellanes some promising σ1 receptor ligands were identified. Therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to shed light on their mechanism of binding. The starting structure for the σ1 receptor was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 5HK1) [7]. Following a consolidated computational protocol [49,52], the binding modes of compounds 9a (Figure 10A,C) and anti-5 (Figure 10B,D) were initially recognized. A MM/PBSA (molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area) approach [53] provided the binding free energy (ΔG) of the complexes of both compounds with the σ1 receptor. The obtained energetic values are in good agreement with their different σ1 affinity. The following ΔG values were obtained: −10.02 kcal/mol for 9a (Ki(σ1) = 17 nM) and −8.87 kcal/mol for anti-5 (Ki(σ1) = 82 nM).

As expected, both σ1 ligands share the same thermodynamics pattern; their binding is enthalpy driven characterized by favorable van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. Specifically, our analysis resulted in an enthalpy contribution (ΔH) of −18.47 kcal/mol and −17.58 kcal/mol for 9a and anti-5, respectively. Instead, the entropic components (−TΔS) penalize the binding with the σ1 receptor with the corresponding values of 8.45 kcal/mol and 8.71 kcal/mol for 9a and anti-5, respectively.

Through the per-residue binding free energy deconvolution (PRBFED) of the enthalpic terms (ΔHres), the main amino acid residues of the σ1 receptor involved in ligand binding were identified. Basically, by elucidation of the specific ligand/protein interactions, the PRBFED analysis (Figure 10E) allowed to better understand the preference of the σ1 receptor for the smaller azapropellane 9a. Specifically, azapropellane 9a is provided with the basic chemical features of a prototypical σ1 receptor ligand: the rings of the propellane system can perform stabilizing hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions with the σ1 residues W89, F107, Y120 and W164 (ΔHres = −3.27 kcal/mol, Figure 10E) while the N-benzyl group is perfectly encased in an hydrophobic cavity underlying σ1 residues I124,V152, and H154 (ΔHres = −1.64 kcal/mol). However, the most peculiar interaction is definitively performed by its charged N-atom, involved in a permanent ionic interaction with the carboxylic group of E172 (ΔHres = −4.93 kcal/mol) with a detected average dynamics length (ADL) of 1.75 ± 0.12 Å (Figure 10A,F). Moreover, the optimal orientation of this interaction is guaranteed by a stable, internal hydrogen bond between the other O-atom of E172 and the OH moiety of Y103 (ADL = 1.73 ± 0.12 Å, Figure 10A,G). In the same series, the propellanamine derivative 18 exhibited a good σ1 affinity (Ki(σ1) = 34 nM). Our MD study confirmed a very similar binding mode and interaction spectra as observed for the azapropellane 9a (Figure S1, Supplementary Materials). Indeed, the charged secondary amine maintained the ionic interaction with E172 (ΔHres = −4.44 kcal/mol, Figure S1) and the cyclohexyl moiety of 18 is able to positively interact in the hydrophobic cavity with σ1 residues I124, V152 and H154 (ΔHres = −1.72 kcal/mol). Accordingly, the σ1/18 complex is provided with a favorable ΔG value of −9.78 kcal/mol.

Compared to 9a, the enthalpic contribution of anti-5 was almost 1 kcal/mol lower, although its 2-methoxy-5-methylphenyl carbamate moiety could provide additional interactions in the σ1 receptor cavity (Figure 10B,D). However, these additional interactions of anti-5 with residues L95, L182 and Y206 (ΔHres = −1.68 kcal/mol, Figure 10E) were not specific and could not compensate the decrease of the other interactions due to a not optimal orientation in the binding site. Indeed, anti-5 cannot establish an optimal H-bond with the carboxylate side chain of E172 (ΔHres = −3.65 kcal/mol) as demonstrated by the less stable ADL detected in our MD simulation (ADL = 2.12 ± 0.35 Å, Figure 10B,F). Furthermore, the assumed binding pose of anti-5 does not allow an optimal position of its N-benzyl moiety in the hydrophobic cavity underlying I124, V152 and H154 (ΔHres = −0.53 kcal/mol, Figure 10E). Moreover, optimal stabilizing interactions of the propellane system of anti-5 with W89, F107, Y120 and W164 (ΔHres = −2.58 kcal/mol) were not reached.

4. Conclusions

In this manuscript, the rigid propellane system was used to attach σ1 and σ2 pharmacophoric substituents in a defined three-dimensional orientation. It was shown, that propellanes with both substituents at the five-membered rings adopting syn-configuration (e.g., syn,syn-4a) exhibited high σ1 affinity underlining the importance of the stereochemistry. Urea instead of the amino moiety led to the loss of σ1 and σ2 affinity. High σ1 affinity was achieved by incorporation of the basic amino moiety into the propellane scaffold. The azapropellanes anti-5 and 9a demonstrated high σ1 affinity, which is enthalpy driven. Although the carbamate moiety of anti-5 contributed to the binding free energy of anti-5 within the σ1 receptor binding pocket, it forces the complete propellane scaffold and its benzyl moiety into a less favorable orientation in the binding pocket. As a result, the σ1 affinity of anti-5 is lower than the σ1 affinity of 9a.

5.4. Computational Details

The starting structure for the σ1 receptor was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 5HK1, https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5HK1 (accessed date: 3 March 2021) [7], of which only the protomer with the more complete sequence was retained for the simulations. The CHARMM-GUI server [54] was used to embed the σ1 monomer in a palmitoyl-oleyl-phosphatidyl-choline (POPC, 218 lipid molecules were added) bilayer solvated with explicit TIP3P [55] and water molecules to succeed complete hydration of the membrane and reach a physiological concentration of sodium and chloride ions (0.15 M NaCl). Antechamber program from AMBER20 [56] was used to assign gaff2 [57] atom types to each ligand, while ligand’s partial charges were derived by employing the RESP method offered by the RED server [58]. Docking and classical molecular dynamics simulations on σ1 receptor in complex with the new azapropellane derivatives were carried out following a well validated procedure [49,52,59]. Briefly, the system density and volume were relaxed in NPT ensemble maintaining the Berendsen barostat for 20 ns. After this step, 50 ns of unrestrained NVT production simulation was run for each system. Following the MM/PBSA approach [55], each binding free energy values (ΔG) were calculated as the sum of the enthalpic (ΔH) and entropic contributions (-TΔS). The PRBFED analysis was carried out using the molecular mechanics/generalized Boltzmann surface area (MM/GBSA) approach [60] and was based on the same snapshots used in the binding free energy calculation. All images were created by the UCSF Chimera software v1.15 [61], and graphs were produced by GraphPad Prism v8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com).

5.5.1. General

Data sets for compounds syn-7, anti-21, syn,anti-22, anti,syn-22 and syn-25 were collected with a Bruker Kappa CCD diffractometer. Programs used: data collection, COLLECT [62], data reduction Denzo-SMN [63]; absorption correction [64]; structure solution SHELXT-2015 [65]; structure refinement SHELXL-2015 [66] and graphics, XP [67]. R-values are given for observed reflections, and wR2 values are given for all reflections.
