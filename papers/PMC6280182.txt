Objectives:
to validate the vulnerability markers of dysfunctions in the socioemotional
development of infants. 

Methods:
study with a sequential exploratory mixed-method design. The vulnerability
markers elaborated in the qualitative phase were analyzed by experts in the
quantitative phase using the Delphi technique with a minimum consensus of
70%. Seventeen judges answered the questionnaire in the first round of
analysis and 11 answered in the second round. 

Results:
in the first round, two markers did not reach minimum consensus: the presence
of instability in family relationships (66%) and delinquency and/or drug
abuse by parents/caregivers (65%). In the second round, all markers were
validated, with more than 90% agreement in most of the attributes, and
reached the minimum consensus of 73%. 

Conclusion:
the eight vulnerability markers reached the minimum consensus for validation,
and a relevant instrument for infant care can be developed after assessing
the reliability and clinically validating these markers.

==== Body
Introduction
The objective of this study was to validate the vulnerability markers of dysfunctions
in the socioemotional development of infants. We attempted to construct an
instrument that assessed dysfunctions in socioemotional development, which is
determined by the maintenance or changes in social and emotional characteristics of
children
1
 and characterized by the expression of emotions in social contexts, in the
social triggers of emotional expressions, and in the social construction of
emotional experience and understanding
2
.

Socioemotional development is related to the development of the brain and the
interactions or proximal processes experienced by the child from birth
1
 and can be analyzed by evaluating developmental milestones from several
domains, including attachment, social competence, emotional competence, and
self-perception
3
.

The bioecological model of human development indicates that a child living in adverse
conditions and in a disorganized environment is susceptible to developmental
dysfunctions, including “recurrent difficulties in maintaining emotional control and
integrating behavior in different developmental situations and domains”
1
. Therefore, child development is affected by biological and contextual
factors
4

-

5
.

Developmental dysfunctions include a group of diseases characterized by intellectual,
physical, and social-emotional problems
6
. These dysfunctions are related to brain disorders caused by genetic changes
or lesions in the central nervous system, exposure to teratogenic agents, trauma,
infections, severe nutritional deficiency, and neonatal hypoxia or ischemia
6
. Studies have confirmed that sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and
biological factors affect child development in all its dimensions, including
socioemotional
4

,

7
.

The technologies available to monitor child development include scales based on
markers and expected behaviors for different age groups. These technologies assess
the child’s abilities but do not consider the factors that affect child development,
leaving a significant gap in the analysis of dangerous situations.

The complexity of socioemotional development involves the concept of vulnerability,
which is a set of conditions that make the child more susceptible to developmental
dysfunctions due to the effect of individual, social, and programmatic
dimensions
8
. The concept of vulnerability demands the proposition of interventions based
on health needs, development of social responses, autonomy in care, preservation of
health, and integrality and equity of health actions
9
.

The need to instrumentalize health professionals to identify vulnerabilities in child
development led to the proposition of the following question: How can professionals
assess the vulnerability to dysfunctions in the socioemotional development of
infants?

The construction of markers may help health professionals apply the concept of
vulnerability as an indicator of qualitative aspects of the health-disease process
at the individual and community levels, and these markers allow proposing
interventions that address social responses to dysfunctions
9

-

10
. The term “vulnerability marker” includes the interaction of subjective and
contextual attributes in the health-disease process as social and historical
phenomena
11
.

This study assumes that the use of markers as health technologies, based on
vulnerability elements, can improve care and socioemotional development by
strengthening proximal processes, which are the specific forms of interaction
between children and their environment
1
.

The identification of these elements and characterization of the conditions of child
development beyond the short-term performance, expressed in behaviors or
developmental milestones, requires the inclusion and organization of these elements
in an instrument applicable to the care practice. Therefore, the objective of this
study was to validate markers of vulnerability to dysfunctions in the socioemotional
development of infants.

Method
This mixed-method study combined qualitative and quantitative methods
12
. A sequential exploratory design was used, including a first (qualitative)
phase for marker construction and a second (quantitative) phase for content
validation.

Vulnerability markers were elaborated in the qualitative phase. These markers are
thematic categories of exposure factors that affect the socioemotional development
of infants
13
 and are theoretically based on the context dimensions of the bioecological
model of human development-microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem
1
-and the Child Vulnerability Matrix for situations that jeopardize child
development in the individual, social, and programmatic dimensions
8
. In this study, infants are children younger than two years.

Each marker is composed of a title, components, and an operational manual, and the
function of the latter is to guide the application of the analytical instrument. The
manual contains the definition of the markers, vulnerabilities, sources of
information on the marker, and the criteria for defining the presence of the
marker
11
.

The original version of the vulnerability markers was sent to the experts for content
validation. The markers are shown in Figures 1
and 2.

The Delphi technique
14
 was applied in the quantitative phase to validate the content of the
markers, components, and operational manuals by researchers identified in the
Platform Lattes who were specialists in socioemotional development. The selection
criteria of the judges were the time of clinical experience and/or research on
infant health, completion of undergraduate studies with a minimum duration of 5
years, and graduate studies in infant health.

Eighty-four nursing researchers and other health professionals were invited to assess
the instrument because the concept of vulnerability is multidisciplinary. The
invitations were made by sending an e-mail containing the Informed Consent Form
(ICF) and the validation script of the markers in electronic format. Participants
were considered the professionals who returned the ICF and completed the
questionnaire within the deadline established for the first round. Two rounds of
evaluation were necessary to reach the minimum consensus.

The questionnaire was developed using Microsoft Excel. The first page contained the
ICF and guidelines for completing the questionnaire. All the content related to the
markers was described in a spreadsheet, allowing participants to answer the
questions using all available information.

The criteria used during validation to evaluate the attributes and relevance of the
markers were simplicity, clarity, pertinence, and precision. The questions asked
were 1. “Is the marker easily explained and understood?”, 2. “Can data on the marker
be easily obtained?”, 3. “Does the marker effectively identify vulnerabilities to
dysfunctions in the socioemotional development of infants?”, 4. “Can the marker be
used in care practice?”, 5. “How important is this marker to identify infant
vulnerabilities?“

The following questions were formulated to evaluate the attributes of marker
components: 1. “Does the component adequately express the presence of a
vulnerability in infants?”, 2. “Is the component constructed with simple and
unambiguous expressions?”, 3. “Does the component differ from other components?”

The following questions were formulated to evaluate the operational manual: 1. “Was
the marker and what it measures adequately described?”, 2. “This marker reflects
vulnerabilities in individual, social, or programmatic factors. Do you agree with
this statement?”, 3. “Are the sources of information accessible and adequate to
obtain the data?”, 4. “Are the criteria adequately described and allow the same
interpretation among the different health professionals who used the
instrument?”

Only the “yes/agree” question was considered, excluding from the analysis the answers
“yes, but requires revision/partial agreement” and “no/disagree.” The revisions
necessary between each collection stage were made according to the suggestions of
the judges.

Possible answers were agreement, partial agreement, or disagreement, and there was
room for comments. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis, and the
minimum consensus was 70%
15

-

16
. The consensus is the expected result of the Delphi technique. Therefore,
the definition of consensus criteria and the description of the degree of agreement
and the validation results are essential

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Nursing of
the University of São Paulo via the Certificate for Ethics Assessment (Certificado
de Apresentação para Apreciação Ética-CAAE) No. 57933816.8.0000.5392. The study
complied with human research guidelines.

Results
The first round of content validation was completed by 17 participants. Of these, 11
were nurses, two were physical therapists, two were occupational therapists, and two
were psychologists. Most participants had a time of academic education longer than
10 years, with an M.S. and/or Ph.D. degree and experience in teaching, research, and
care practice.

The judges returned the materials within 30 days and completed 95% of the
questionnaires in the first round. The results of the assessments were tabulated
according to pre-established parameters. The level of consensus of the judges in the
first round is presented in Table 1.

In the first round, the level of consensus of most of the assessed items was medium
to high (70-94%). In addition to the objective answers, the judges provided 206
written suggestions, which were used in content review in the second round. The
judges’ suggestions were related to the writing, presentation, and exemplification
of the components.

The fourth marker component, “difficulty of parents/caregivers in bonding with the
child,” was modified according to the judges’ recommendation: The term
“parental anxiety” does not seem to be the most appropriate. My
interpretation is that this term indicates the exaggerated concern,
maladjustment, or emotional imbalance of the parents due to the behavior of the
child. (J10)

The second and third marker components, “limitations of parents/caregivers in
providing physical protection and safety to the child,” were drafted differently
without the term “neglect” considering the following recommendation: I
suggest replacing the term “neglect” with another construct, such as “do not
take the necessary measures.” This marker is important because it is common for
families not to identify the risk factors for accidents. (J10) The
fourth component was rewritten according to the judge’s suggestion: I
suggest replacing the term “adherence” with “undergoing prenatal examination and
prenatal care.” (J10)

The number of components of the marker “presence of illnesses in parents/caregivers.”
was reduced from six to three considering the recommendation: All questions
except the last one were related to mental health. However, does altered
physical health affect childcare? In addition, considering that all these
symptoms are related to changes in mental health, it may seem confusing: can
stress, depression, and schizophrenia affect care in different ways? If so, why
are these symptoms separated? (J15)

The simplicity and expression of the fourth marker component, “presence of
instability in family relations,” reached a consensus of 64%, which is lower than
the minimum consensus. The component was changed according to the following
commentary: I suggest the following change: “(...) negative experiences
within the family.” (J1) Describe the term “negative experiences” better and
remove the terms related to mental health problems because they have already
been included in another marker. (J15)

It was suggested to include support for mothers in this marker: I suggest
leaving this item as “there is no support for childcare” and exclude the
sentence “for the mother who works outside” because I consider that support is
necessary for all mothers, regardless of working outside. (J13)
Therefore, the term “social support” was added.

The relevance of the first, third, and fourth components of the marker “delinquency
and/or abuse by parents/caregiver” reached a consensus of 64%. The simplicity and
expression of these components reached a consensus of 65%. The judges made the
following suggestion: Fulfillment of sentence because of the practice of
criminal offenses. The inconsistency is related to the verb in the two tenses
(present and past).(J15) Does this item indicate that
caregivers suffer from domestic violence or the male partner is violent with the
female partner?(J4) Review “there is presence.” I suggest
including the question “Do parents/caregivers make use of psychoactive or other
drugs?”(J9)

With respect to the marker “limited autonomy and/or empowerment because of
sociocultural conditions,” the following suggestion was accepted: Is the
difficulty related to the parents or the child? Autonomy/empowerment is also a
limitation. I suggest leaving only the term “autonomy”(J15). The fifth
component of this marker was modified according to the judges’ recommendation:
I suggest adding “gangs or organized crime” to a situation closer to the
“Brazilian war conflicts.” (J1) I suggest excluding the term “war” because it is
not the reality of Brazil, and perhaps include the term “urban
violence.”(J13)

The first marker component, “poor socioeconomic conditions of parents/caregivers,”
was modified according to the judges’ recommendation: The question is
repetitive. I suggest including the question: “Does the family have an income
lower than the minimum wage”? (J11) I suggest rewriting the
sentence, perhaps expressing the item as per capita income because a family with
three members living on a minimum wage is different from a family with ten
people living on a minimum wage.(J13) The fourth component was modified
according to the suggestions of one judge: Can the family live in a borrowed
or occupied house under normal conditions? I think what matters is the
precarious situation. I suggest eliminating the first part of the sentence and
including the sentence “The family lives in a precarious
house.”(J15)

After the inclusions and adaptations in the first round, the instrument was subjected
to the second round of the Delphi technique. Of the 17 judges who participated in
the first round, 11 participated in the second round. Of these, eight were nurses,
one was a physiotherapist, and two were occupational therapists. The majority had a
time of academic education longer than 10 years, with an M.S. and/or Ph.D. degree
and experience in teaching, research, and care practice.

In the second round, the judges returned the materials within 30 days and completed
99% of the questionnaires. The level of consensus of the judges is presented in
Table 2.

The level of consensus of most of the elements evaluated in the second round was high
(82-100%), and two markers obtained the minimum consensus of 73%, which was higher
than the established minimum, and the validation process was complete. In the last
round, the judges sent 45 comments with suggestions on the writing of the
components, and these suggestions improved the clarity and understanding of the
instrument.

The markers of vulnerability to dysfunctions in the socioemotional development of
infants and marker components of the final version are described in Figure 3. These elements were classified into
three categories according to the contexts of the bioecological model of human
development and vulnerability dimensions: individual (green), social (orange), and
programmatic (blue).

Discussion
The vulnerability markers were subjected to the Delphi technique and assessed by
qualified professionals (with an M.S. and/or Ph.D. degree) with more than 10 years
of academic training. These judges performed a critical analysis of the material and
provided many suggestions (206 in the first round and 45 in the second). The
questionnaire adherence rate was high (95% in the first round and 99% in the second
round). These results corroborate the Delphi technique, whose application demands
the recruitment of experienced, socially critical, and professionally self-critical
judges who can make significant changes and adaptations to the analyzed
material
17

-

18
.

The number of participants in the first and second rounds was considered pertinent by
the literature, which defines a minimum of 10-15 specialists to obtain a set of
high-quality opinions
18
. Therefore, the markers were appraised by a diverse group of judges from
different areas of practice, allowing a thorough analysis of the material.

Although this instrument was initially intended for use in the area of nursing in
infant health, the evaluation and improvement of the quality of these parameters by
psychologists, occupational therapists, and physical therapists were relevant
considering that psychosocial development is multidisciplinary. This
multiprofessional evaluation is recommended by the Delphi technique, which makes
these parameters accessible to a diverse and geographically dispersed population,
allowing the provision of different opinions
19
.

Failure to reach the expected consensus in the first round for all analyzed items may
be justified by the high number of comments from the judges because many sentences
were written using terms deemed inappropriate. The achievement of a minimum
consensus of 73% and the comparatively lower number of comments in the second round
demonstrated that the material was more appropriate.

With regard to changes in the content of the marker components “difficulty of
parents/caregivers in bonding with the child” and “limitations of parents/caregivers
to provide physical protection and safety to the child,” the modifications allowed a
better understanding of the limitations of childcare. These limitations affect the
type and quality of care and the interactions between parents and infants
1

,

20
.

With respect to the marker “illnesses in parents/caregivers,” the judge’s
recommendation to include the mental health conditions to facilitate their
identification by professionals was considered adequate. The presence of mental
disorders is related to the lower degree of affection for the infant and the
development of weak bonding
20
.

With respect to the marker “presence of instability in family relations,” which did
not reach the minimum consensus, the judges’ suggestions were pertinent because
negative experiences might lead to vulnerabilities in caregivers, limit childcare
support, and lead to neglect and exposure of the child to dangerous situations
21

-

22
.

With regard to the marker “situations of delinquency and/or drug abuse by
parents/caregivers,” which also did not reach minimum consensus, addressing the drug
abuse of parents/caregivers is relevant to identify situations that are adverse to
the socioemotional development of the infant
23

-

24
. Similarly, home violence suffered by caregivers may impair childcare and
consequently the bonding with the child (

25
. Therefore, the proposed modifications avoid erroneous interpretations of
professionals when using this instrument.

With regard to the marker “limited autonomy of parents/caregivers because of
sociocultural conditions,” emphasizing the autonomy of caregivers in the title of
the marker is relevant because this marker reflects the caregivers’ ability to care
for the child
8

,

22

-

23
. Adaptations were made in the component of this marker to characterize
violence as a set of conditions that imposed stigma and oppression on
caregivers
23
.

The changes in the marker “poor socioeconomic conditions of parents/caregivers” are
pertinent because professionals should understand that growth under conditions of
poverty exposes the child to poor living conditions. Therefore, the socioeconomic
status of the family directly affects childcare
4

,

8
.

The high agreement rates for vulnerability markers starting in the first round of
analysis indicate that such markers are comprehensive for the bioecology of
development
1
 and vulnerability
8
.

The reliability and clinical validation of the vulnerability markers presented in
this study need to be assessed beyond the consensus of expert opinions, and this
validation will increase the applicability of primary health care practices to
promote the socioemotional development of infants
8
.

Conclusion
The markers of vulnerability to dysfunctions in the socioemotional development of
infants was validated after two rounds of the Delphi technique, and most markers,
components, and operational manuals reached a high rate of agreement (>90%) and a
minimum level of consensus of 73%.

The consensus reached using the Delphi technique allows testing this technology in
clinical practice to assess its reliability by professionals to create care models
based on the actual health needs of infants and minimize exposure factors and the
vulnerability to dysfunctions in socioemotional development.

One of the limitations of this study was that the markers were based on scientific
evidence that might not account for the totality of current vulnerability
situations; therefore, the reliability of these markers needs to be evaluated.
Longitudinal studies that allow the routine clinical validation of vulnerability
markers by health professionals during child and family care are necessary.

For nursing practice, the application of this instrument allows constructing a scale
of vulnerability, identify new diagnoses in nursing, and elaborate intervention
plans that promote the socioemotional development of infants by nurses and other
professionals.
