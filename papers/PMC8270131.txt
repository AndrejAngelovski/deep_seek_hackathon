The objective of this study was to determine whether maternal or paternal ages have any impact on the prenatal incidence of genomic copy number variants (CNV) in fetuses with structural anomalies. We conducted a non-paired case-control study (1:2 ratio) among pregnancies undergoing chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) because of fetal ultrasound anomalies, from December 2012 to May 2020. Pregnancies with any pathogenic copy number variant (CNV), either microdeletion or microduplication, were defined as cases. Controls were selected as the next two pregnancies with the same indication for CMA but with a normal result. Logistic regression was used, adjusting by use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and parental smoking. Stratified analysis was performed according to CNV type (de novo/inherited and recurrent/non-recurrent). The study included 189 pregnancies: 63 cases and 126 controls. Mean maternal age in cases was 33.1 (SD 4.6) years and 33.9 (SD 6.0) years in controls. Mean paternal mean age was 34.5 (SD 4.8) years in cases and 35.8 (SD 5.8) years in controls. No significant differences in maternal or paternal age were observed, neither in stratified analysis according to the CNV type. Moreover, the proportion of cases were not significantly different between non-advanced and advanced ages, either considering paternal or maternal ages. The presence of pathogenic CNV at CMA in fetuses with structural anomalies was not found to be associated with advanced paternal or maternal age.

Introduction

Aneuploidies are the leading genetic cause of miscarriage and developmental disabilities in humans. Genetic recombination is known to contribute to human aneuploidies by producing nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes, although an understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for meiotic non-disjunction remains elusive. Advanced maternal age has been long recognized as the primary risk factor for nondisjunction. It is well established that the frequency of aneuploidies dramatically increase in older mothers [1, 2]. Regarding a paternal age effect, some studies have reported that advanced paternal age is associated with a significantly higher risk of fetal chromosomal defects [3], although these findings were not confirmed by other studies [4].

Advanced paternal age has been suggested to be a risk factor for an adverse pregnancy outcome (stillbirth, preterm birth and low birthweight), for structural anomalies (encephalocele and microcephalia, cleft lip and palate, neural tube defects and cardiac defects) and for some childhood disorders (autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or cancer) [5–10]. Regarding chromosomal anomalies, most of de novo structural aberrations are paternal in origin, in contrast to aneuploidies that are mainly of maternal origin. This may reflect a vulnerability of pre-meiotic divisions of germ cells to structural rearrangements, as there are many more of these divisions in the male than in the female germ cell line [11, 12]. Furthermore, some monogenic disorders have been reported to be more frequent in advanced paternal age, mainly skeletal dysplasias and craniosynostotic syndromes [13–15]. As a man ages, the number of de novo single nucleotide variant (SNV) in his sperm increases, and the chance that a child would carry a mutation that could lead to monogenic disorders increases proportionally [16].

There are scarce data on intermediate sized genomic imbalances, between 10 kb and 10 Mb, known as genomic copy number variations (CNV), also called submicroscopic chromosomal anomalies or microdeletions and microduplications. Although some studies have suggested an association between clinical neuropsychiatric disorders with both an increased paternal age and CNV [11, 17], no link was found between CNV and advanced paternal age in an extensive Dutch study including psychiatric, neurologic and urologic patients [17]. No studies have been reported on pathogenic CNVs in fetuses with ultrasonographically detected structural defects. Our study will explore if advanced parental ages are linked to prenatal incidence of genomic CNV in structurally abnormal fetuses.

Materials and methods

We conducted a retrospective non-paired case-control study (1:2 ratio) in the Prenatal Diagnosis Unit of BCNatal-Hospital Clínic Barcelona including pregnancies in which chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) was performed during an 8-year study period (December 2012 to May 2020) because of fetal structural anomalies or ultrasound markers. Cases were defined as those fetuses in which CMA revealed a submicroscopic anomaly, defined as a genomic imbalance < 10Mb, after exclusion of pregnancies achived by assisted reproductive technologies with gamete donation and those procedures performed because a family history. The variants of uncertain significance were excluded from the study. Controls were selected as the following two fetuses with the same main reason for CMA resulting in a normal result. The case list found during the study period determined the sample size.

Data were collected retrospectively by reviewing prenatal and obstetric records. Information on demographic data, smoking, singleton/twin pregnancy, utilization of assisted reproductive technology (ART), result of first trimester combined test, ultrasound findings including type of structural malformations, gestational age at diagnosis, type of invasive prenatal diagnosis and maternal and paternal age at conception were obtained. The results of invasive prenatal diagnostics were retrieved from our department of genetics. The case list of genetic microdeletions was merged with our prenatal database.

Maternal age was obtained as the exact age at conception directly from our database. Biological paternity was not assessed. Paternal age was obtained as the age reached at conception through a telephone interview with the mother. The father provided informed oral consent to have data from their medical records used in this study, given that the need for written consent was waived by the ethics committee. Advanced maternal age was defined as ≥35 years while advanced paternal age was defined at ≥40 age according to previous studies [18]. The first trimester combined test includes maternal age at the expected date of delivery, nuchal translucency measurement, serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A). A high-risk result was defined when at least one of the two estimated risks, for trisomy 21, and for trisomy 18–13, was above 1:250.

CMA is a technology used for the detection of CNV, either microdeletions or microduplications, as well as conventional chromosomal anomalies. It is able to detect genomic changes as small as 10Kb in size—a resolution up to 1000 times higher than that of conventional karyotyping.

CMA is used for uncovering CNVs thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders, primarily congenital anomalies. Reasons for CMA were divided into eight different categories, most of them types of structural fetal anomalies: neurologic, cardio-vascular, nephro-urologic, skeletal, multiple malformations, in addition to ultrasound aneuploidy markers, fetal growth restriction (FGR) and other anomalies such as polyhydramnios and stillbirth. FGR was defined by the statistical deviation of an estimated fetal weight from a population-based reference, below the third centile, or alternatively to fetuses with an EFW below the 10th centile and a concomitant abnormal fetal or uterine Doppler.

During the first four years (2012–2015) of the study, a BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) microarray (CytoChip Focus Constitutional, BlueGenome, Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) was used with a 1 Mb resolution along the whole genome and 100 kb in 143 constitutional regions associated with pathology. In the four last years of the study (2016–2020) a high-resolution oligonucleotide microarray (qChip Prenatal from qGenomics, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain) was used. The qChip Prenatal microarray is based on an Agilent 8x60K format and provides a high coverage of clinically relevant regions (1 probe/10Kb on average). In all cases, scanning and image acquisition were carried out using an Agilent microarray scanner (G2565BA) and data analysis was performed using the BlueFuse Multi software (BlueGnome) or the qGenviewer software (qGenomics) as reported elsewhere [19].

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and visual plot inspection were used to assess the normality of continuous data distributions. We performed a correction in paternal age, adding 0.5 years in each male individual to correct the bias of truncated age. Categorical data are presented as n (%) and continuous data as mean [standard deviation (SD)] or median [interquartile range (IQR)] according to their distribution. A Kruskal-Wallis test and a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test were used to compare differences of arithmetic variables between the groups. Comparisons of proportions were performed using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. Student’s t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test and Pearson Chi-square test were used to perform univariate comparisons between groups of quantitative and qualitative variables, respectively. Power was calculated for a case-control study with a sample size of 189 and 1:2 ratio, assuming a relevant difference of 2 years between groups, with a result of 75.6%. The sample size was determined by the cohort of fetuses that met the inclusion criteria during the study period (December 2012 to May 2020), the first 8 years of CMA application in our center. This is the complete cohort of pathogenic CNVs found at CMA in chromosomally abnormal fetuses studied in our center. The power was calculated according to our sample size. Differences on the proportion of cases between non- advanced and advanced age was assessed for maternal and paternal ages.

We performed a logistic regression to assess the impact of maternal and paternal age in the CMA result, adjusting by possible confounders as utilization of ART and maternal and paternal smoking. We have chosen these two possible confounders as there is some evidence that ART and smoke could increase the risk of genetic anomalies in oocytes and sperm [20, 21]. Furthermore, stratified analysis was performed in recurrent and non-recurrent CNVs and de novo and inherited CNVs. Some CNVs are recurrently observed in the human genome, and they are thought to arise by homologous recombination between repeated sequences, a process called non-allelic homologous recombination. Missing data were assumed to miss at random. For all analyses, a two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered significant. All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata/IC 15.1©.

Results

During the 8-year study period (December 2012 to May 2020), 63 structurally abnormal fetuses with a pathogenic CNV were enrolled as cases after exclusion of 9 pregnancies achived by assisted reproductive technologies with gamete donation and 21 procedures performed because a family history and 126 controls were selected as the following two fetuses with the same structural anomaly and a normal CMA result. 21 variants of uncertain significance were excluded from the study. The mean gestational age at the diagnosis of fetal anomalies was 23.1 (SD 7.4) weeks. Prenatal diagnosis was performed by amniocentesis in 150 (79%) pregnancies and by chorionic villus sampling in 39 (21%) pregnancies. There were no significant differences between cases and controls in maternal and pregnancy characteristics (Table 1).

The most frequent indication for CMA was cardio-vascular defects (32%) followed by neurologic anomalies (16%). Table 2 shows the frequencies for the eight different categories. Among the 63 submicroscopic pathogenic anomalies, 15 microduplications and 48 microdeletions were found. There were 28 (44%) recurrent and 7 (11%) inherited CNVs (S1 Table).

There were no significant differences in maternal or paternal age in non-adjusted logistic regression, and even after adjusting for possible confounders such as ART and maternal or paternal smoking (Table 3). Stratified analysis in recurrent and non-recurrent CNVs, and also in de novo and inherited CNVs resulted in no significant differences in any of the categories (Table 4). Results were assumed as non-statistical significance since all OR 95% confidence intervals included number 1. Moreover, no differences were observed in the proportion of cases between groups of non-advanced and advanced age either for maternal and paternal ages (Table 5).

Discussion

Main findings

Our study in fetuses undergoing CMA for ultrasound anomalies demonstrated that there were no differences in either paternal or maternal age between fetuses affected by pathogenic CNVs as compared with those with a normal CMA result. Maternal age effect in the origin of fetal aneuploidy and a paternal age effect in de novo SNV particularly those related to skeletal anomalies and neurodevelopmental disorders are well established, but the effect of parental age seems not to be relevant in the origin of CNV, either recurrent or non-recurrent.

Comparison with the literature

An increased risk for genomic CNV has been reported in intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital defects [22]. In the prenatal field, fetal structural defects including also increased nuchal translucency [23], FGR [24] and stillbirth [25] have been shown to carry an increased risk for pathogenic CNVs. However, advanced maternal age has not been shown to carry and incremental risk for CNV above pregnancies of the general population [26].

Data from postnatal studies have shown that most of the CNV are of paternal origin. A Dutch study including 118 subjects with intellectual disability and nonrecurrent de novo CNV found that 76% of CNVs in this cohort originated in the paternal allele. This paternal bias was independent of CNV characteristics: type (loss/gain), genomic size (<1 Mb or >1 Mb) and genomic mechanism involved (recurrent or non-recurrent). Recurrent de novo CNVs are often flanked by segmental duplications in the direct vicinity of the CNV breakpoints that mediate the generation of these rearrangements through non-allelic homologous recombination. Interestingly enough, a significant increase in paternal age was observed in the 74 cases of de novo CNVs without segmental duplications in the direct vicinity of their breakpoints. This results suggest that increased paternal age may have a major impact on the generation of non-recurrent CNVs [17]. A similar British study including 173 patients with physical and/or neurological abnormalities and a de novo imbalance identified by array CGH found more paternally derived imbalances. The majority of those imbalances arose through male-specific mechanisms other than non-allelic homologous recombination, such as mitotic mechanisms, although a paternal-age effect was not observed [12].

A large prospective population-based cohort study in the Netherlands, including 6,501 healthy participants with parental age information, found no evidence of paternal age effect on CNV load in the offspring. In contrast to studies that suggest de novo single nucleotide variant (SNV) rate to be dominated by paternal age at conception, these results strongly suggest that at the level of global CNV burden there is no influence of increased paternal age. While it remains possible that local genomic effects may exist for specific phenotypes, this study supports that global CNV burden and increased father’s age may be independent disease risk factors [27].

The effect of paternal age on the rate of de novo SNV and CNVs in healthy subjects, was explored in selected ten families consisting of two monozygotic twins and their parents from the Quebec Study of Newborn Twins (QSNT) project [28]. This study demonstrated a strong positive correlation between paternal age and germline de novo SNV in healthy subjects using disease-free familial quartets. However, germline CNVs did not follow the same pattern, because the CNV rate did not change with parental age. This finding supports the current evidence that CNV and single nucleotide variations (SNV) have different mechanism, given that it is thought that most CNVs in the human genome arise from non-allelic homologous recombination, while a vast majority of the SNVs occur during DNA replication.

There is a single prenatal series in which the paternal age was recently studied in fetuses carrying a genomic CNV. This large series from a laboratory from United States, included 127 prenatal cases, in which samples were collected according to clinical indications for prenatal diagnosis, reported non-significant differences between cases (de novo CNVs) and controls (inherited CNVs). However, in the postnatal series, a maternal age effect was observed to be associated with a higher rate of de novo recurrent CNV [29].

Clinical application

Advanced maternal age was the most important reason for diagnostic amniocentesis during many decades. Nowadays advanced paternal age, arbitrarily defined as 40 years or more, is suggested to be a reason to screen for the most common autosomal dominant monogenic disorders. Meanwhile, the incidence of CNVs does not appear to be influenced by either maternal or paternal age.

Our study is the first to explore the link between paternal age and CNV in congenital birth defects, particularly fetal structural anomalies detected by prenatal ultrasound. Although CNVs account for about 1% of liveborn fetuses, similar to the chromosomal anomaly rate, only a small proportion of liveborn with a pathogenic CNV can be prenatally suspected by a previous history or fetal ultrasound anomalies. This is an argument to support the universal offering of CMA to all pregnant women [30].

Strengthens and weaknesses

Our study is not without limitations. A major shortcoming of the study is the fact that the parent of origin of their CNVs, especially their de novo CNVs, was not studied. By using a population that is limited to fetuses with abnormal ultrasounds, there is already an increased likelihood of an underlying genetic cause. If no pathogenic CNV is found, it is possible that the ultrasound anomalies exist because of an SNV or other underlying mutation not able to be ascertained by the CMA platform. As advanced paternal age is considered a risk factor for SNVs, the “control” group with normal CMAs may have an increased paternal age because these are actually fetuses with de novo SNVs. Another limitation of the present study is that it was conducted in a single-center that acts as a tertiary referral center, where we receive fetal structural anomalies from different cities of Catalonia and Spain. Extremely advanced maternal age or utilization of ART can be one of the reasons for referral, resulting in an older pregnant women population. Furthermore, as this is one of the first studies exploring the link between paternal age and CNV, we could overlook possible confounders currently unknown. In addition, despite the fact that this is a substantive and commendable number of as clinical case studies go in amassing fetal structural anomalies with array CMA data for each case, it is still is a limited number of cases to examine the paternal age effect. On contrary, a strength of our study is that consecutive cases during the study period were included, avoiding selection biases. We conducted a case-control study in which both groups shared the same reason for CMA. This is relevant because it can lead to explore our hypothesis in different groups of fetal structural anomalies.

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: Thank you for allowing me to review this study. In this manuscript, the authors examined the effect of maternal and paternal age on the incidence of copy number variants detected by microarray in fetuses with anomalies on ultrasound. The study is a matched retrospective case-control study matching in a 1:2 ratio and included 63 cases and 129 controls. The hypothesis was that parental age would be higher in fetuses with CNVs. Overall, however, the authors show that maternal and paternal age are no different in fetuses with CNVs compared to controls. If anything, paternal age was borderline lower in cases.

This study is novel, in that a similar study has not been done in fetuses. However, as acknowledged by the authors, there is already considerable postnatal data from a cohort of almost 6000 patients suggesting that parental age is not very relevant for risk of CNV, unless in some specific conditions. As such, the results of the present study are not very surprising and do not add new scientific knowledge.

Overall however, the manuscript is well written, clear and easy to follow. The methodology seems correct.

I do have a few more concerns:

- It is a bit atypical to see power calculated at 75.6%. Typically, one would aim for 80% or higher. Was this a post-hoc power analysis? I wonder why such a small sample size was used. Only 63 cases were included in 8 years. What was the reason for this low number? Especially in a retrospective analysis, much higher numbers should be available. Why were some cases excluded?

- How did the authors ascertain paternity? Some of the assumed fathers may not have been the biological fathers of the pregnancy.

- Were families with known parental CNVs excluded? Indeed, inclusion of families with known CNVs could bias the results of the findings.

Reviewer #2: The article is a case-control study performed to analyze if maternal and paternal age have an impact on the prenatal incidence of CNVs.

1.Advanced paternal age is also a risk factor for other structural anomalies such as: midline anomalies (neural tube defects, cardiopathy and cleft lip and palate) (Jemal et al and Hook).

Authors should include this sentence and reference.

2.-The objective of the study was to determine whether the paternal or maternal age have an impact on the incidence of CNVs. It is important to break down maternal and paternal age by groups and perform a statistical analysis of each group instead of only comparing mean maternal and paternal ages.

Submission Version1
13 May 2021

Thank you for the opportunity to review our manuscript. We have addressed the Journal requirements and Reviewers’ comments:

Journal Requirements:

1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf and https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf

Done.

2. We noticed you have some minor occurrence of overlapping text with the following previous publication(s), which needs to be addressed https://jmg.bmj.com/content/48/11/776

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00439-012-1261-4

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0164212 In your revision ensure you cite all your sources (including your own works), and quote or rephrase any duplicated text outside the methods section. Further consideration is dependent on these concerns being addressed.

Duplicated texts in the Discussion have been already solved

3. We note that you are reporting an analysis of a microarray, next-generation sequencing, or deep sequencing data set. PLOS requires that authors comply with field-specific standards for preparation, recording, and deposition of data in repositories appropriate to their field. Please upload these data to a stable, public repository (such as ArrayExpress, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), NCBI GenBank, NCBI Sequence Read Archive, or EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (ENA)). In your revised cover letter, please provide the relevant accession numbers that may be used to access these data. For a full list of recommended repositories, see http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-omics or http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-sequencing

We have tried to deposit microarray data in the ArrayExpress public repository. However since we are using a microarray design that has not been previously uploaded and is legally protected we are afraid that we could not achieve this query. Since we are a diagnostic laboratory with a certified quality management system (ISO 9001 AENOR, https://www.en.aenor.com/certificacion/calidad) that routinely perform external quality control assessment (European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) and the Genomics Quality Assessment (GenQA)) for all tests, including prenatal and postnatal microarray analysis, we wonder if could include a “Data availability Statement” indicating that that all data is available upon request without any restriction.

4. Please provide additional details regarding participant consent. In the ethics statement in the Methods and online submission information, please ensure that you have specified (i) whether consent was informed and (ii) what type you obtained (for instance, written or verbal, and if verbal, how it was documented and witnessed). If your study included minors, state whether you obtained consent from parents or guardians. If the need for consent was waived by the ethics committee, please include this information.

If you are reporting a retrospective study of medical records or archived samples, please ensure that you have discussed whether all data were fully anonymized before you accessed them and/or whether the IRB or ethics committee waived the requirement for informed consent. If patients provided informed written consent to have data from their medical records used in research, please include this information.

Accordingly, a new sentence was added in the Methods section: “The father provided informed oral consent to have data from their medical records used in this study, given that the need for written consent was waived by the ethics committee”.

Additional Editor Comments:

The Abstract’s conclusion is not supported by the results in this section.

The Abstract has been rewritten “The presence of pathogenic CNV at CMA in fetuses with structural anomalies was not found to be associated with an advanced paternal or maternal age.”

The authors should include the definition of advanced parental age, and to assess the proportion of CNV between the group with and without advanced maternal and paternal ages.

We have included the definition of advanced maternal and paternal age according to previous studies: “Advanced maternal age defined as ≥ 35 years while advanced paternal age was defined at ≥ 40 years according to previous studies (Elise de La Rochebrochard, Patrick Thonneau, Paternal age and maternal age are risk factors for miscarriage; results of a multicentre European study, Human Reproduction, Volume 17, Issue 6, June 2002, Pages 1649–1656)”.

Furthermore, we conducted a new analysis including the proportion of CNV between groups with and without advanced maternal and paternal ages. We have added new text and a new table as follows:

Abstract: “Moreover, the proportion of cases were not significantly different between non-advanced and advanced age, either considering paternal or maternal ages.”

Methods: “Differences on the proportion of cases between non- advanced and advanced age was assessed for maternal and paternal ages.”

Results: “Moreover, no differences were observed in the proportion of cases between groups of non-advanced and advanced age either for maternal and paternal ages (Table 5)”.

Table 5. Comparison between the proportion of cases in advanced and non-advanced ages according to the maternal and the paternal age.

Maternal Age Paternal Age

< 35 years ≥ 35 years < 40 years ≥ 40 years

Total 112 77 144 45

Cases 41 22 53 10

Proportion of cases 0.366 0.286 0.368 0.222

p-value 0.275 0.100

Please include the number of cases with CNV of unknown significance.

We have add the following sentence in Methods: “The variants of uncertain significance were excluded from the study.” And in Results: “The 21 variants of uncertain significance were excluded from the study.”

Thanks for these comments

I do have a few more concerns:

- It is a bit atypical to see power calculated at 75.6%. Typically, one would aim for 80% or higher. Was this a post-hoc power analysis? I wonder why such a small sample size was used.

We have included this text on Material and Methods: “The sample size was determined by the cohort of fetuses that met the inclusion criteria during the study period (December 2012 to May 2020), the firsts 8 years of CMA application in our center. The power was calculated according to our sample size.”

Only 63 cases were included in 8 years. What was the reason for this low number? Especially in a retrospective analysis, much higher numbers should be available. Why were some cases excluded?

This is the complete cohort of pathogenic CNVs found at CMA in structurally abnormal fetuses studied in our center after exclusion of pregnancies achieved by assisted reproductive technologies with gamete donation and those procedures performed because a family history. One sentence was included in the Methods and another in the Results section.

- How did the authors ascertain paternity? Some of the assumed fathers may not have been the biological fathers of the pregnancy.

We have added a new sentence “Biological paternity was not assessed.” And the following sentenced was changed to better explain how we obtained the paternal age. “Paternal age was obtained as the age reached at conception through a telephone interview with the mother.”

- Were families with known parental CNVs excluded? Indeed, inclusion of families with known CNVs could bias the results of the findings

Families with known parental CNVs were excluded, as stated now in the Methods, but those unknown at the time of sampling and subsequently found to be inherited were not. To avoid this bias, a stratified analysis was performed and de novo and inherited cases were assessed separately.

Reviewer #2: The article is a case-control study performed to analyze if maternal and paternal age have an impact on the prenatal incidence of CNVs.

1.Advanced paternal age is also a risk factor for other structural anomalies such as: midline anomalies (neural tube defects, cardiopathy and cleft lip and palate) (Jemal et al and Hook). Authors should include this sentence and reference.

These structural anomalies have now been added in the Introduction. Two new references have been included:

2.-The objective of the study was to determine whether the paternal or maternal age have an impact on the incidence of CNVs. It is important to break down maternal and paternal age by groups and perform a statistical analysis of each group instead of only comparing mean maternal and paternal ages.

As stated before, we have conducted a new analysis including the proportion of CNV between groups with and without advanced maternal and paternal ages. We have added new text and a new table as follows:
