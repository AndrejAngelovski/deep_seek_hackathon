In the present study, we compared the plasma and brain tissue concentrations of MK-801 after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) administration at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg in male ICR mice. Moreover, these data present the optimization of ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) for the analysis of MK-801 in biological samples. Procedures for the preparation of brain tissue and plasma samples and instrumental analysis are described. This article is related to a research article entitled “Effects of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801, on spatial memory and influence of the route of administration” [1].

1 Data
The developed multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method using SPE for sample pretreatment makes it possible to determine easily the MK-801 concentration in the mouse brain homogenate, unlike the Wegener method [2], which describes the determination of MK-801 in the brain after microdialysis, and a more complicated sampling method.

The data depicted in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 show the calibration line obtained in mouse brain homogenates and representative MRM chromatograms of the calibration standard at the LOQ and a real mouse brain homogenate sample after MK-801 administration.Fig. 1 Calibration line of MK-801 in mouse brain tissue homogenate from 0.1 ng/mL to 10.0 ng/mL. LOQ = 0.20 ng/mL.

The concentration of MK-801 was measured in blood plasma and brain tissue 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after a single i.p. or s.c. administration of MK-801 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The concentration of MK-801 in the brain was significantly higher after s.c. administration than after i.p. administration at all time points until the 120-min time point (Table 1; Fig. 4A).Table 1 The concentration of MK-801 in blood plasma and brain tissue 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after a single i.p. or s.c. administration of MK-801 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.

Fig. 4 Concentrations of MK-801 in brain tissue and blood plasma. Mice received a s.c. or i.p. injection of MK-801 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Brain tissue (A) and blood plasma (B) samples were collected 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after MK-801 administration. Each point represents the mean (± SEM) of three mice per group. The data were analyzed for significant differences using unpaired Student's t-test. *p < 0.05 vs. the corresponding i.p. group.

Fig. 4

Identical effects were observed in blood plasma after MK-801 administration (Table 1; Fig. 4B). The concentration of MK-801 in blood plasma was significantly higher following s.c. injection than following i.p. administration until the 60-min (Fig. 4B). The maximum concentration was reached in brain tissue and blood plasma 15 min after s.c. injection and 30 min after i.p. administration of MK-801 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.

The maximal concentration (Cmax) of MK-801 in brain tissue and blood plasma were almost 2-fold higher when administered via the s.c. route than the i.p. route (Table 2). The concentration of MK-801 in brain tissue was approximately 59% higher after s.c. injection than after i.p. injection, as shown by the area under the curve (AUC, Table 2). The MK-801 AUC value for blood was over 1.5-fold higher after s.c. injection than after i.p. injection (Table 2).Table 2 Pharmacokinetic parameters of MK-801 after s.c. or i.p. administration in brain tissue and blood plasma.

2 Experimental design, materials and methods
2.1 Animals
All studies involving animals were conducted in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines [3,4]. Experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines reported in the EU Directive 2010/63/EU and local laws and policies. All procedures were approved by the Latvian Animal Protection Ethical Committee of Food and Veterinary Service in Riga, Latvia. Thirty male ICR mice weighing 25–30 g at the time of the pharmacokinetics experiment (Harlan Laboratories BV; Venray, Netherlands) were housed under standard conditions (21–23 °C, relative humidity of 65% ± 10%, 12-hour light-dark cycle) with unlimited access to standard food (R70 diet, Lactamin AB, Sweden) and water.

2.2 MK-801 administration
MK-801 ((+)-MK-801 hydrogen maleate) was dissolved in sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). MK-801 concentrations in the brain tissue and plasma were determined in mice receiving single i.p. or s.c. doses of MK-801 at 0.1 mg/kg 15 and 30 min, and 1, 2, and 4 hours before decapitation. Each group consisted of 3 animals for the retrieval of blood and brain samples. The brain was divided into two hemispheres, and 6 measurements were obtained per point.

2.3 Determination of MK-801 levels in blood plasma and brain tissue using UPLC-MS⁄MS
The concentrations of MK-801 in brain tissue and plasma were measured using UPLC-MS⁄MS. Blood was collected in heparin-coated tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to separate the plasma. The brain was gently removed and homogenized in ice-cold Milli-Q water at a w/v ratio of 1:5 in 20-second bursts using a Cole Parmer 130-Watt ultrasonic processor set to 40 kHz. The obtained homogenate was centrifuged at 16500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then decanted, and the pellet was homogenized in the same volume of Milli-Q water as before. The obtained homogenate was centrifuged at 16500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were combined and stored at −80 °C until use.

Brain tissue extract (300 μL) were mixed with 700 μL of 2% formic acid aqueous solution (v/v), vortexed und centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min. 100 μL of mouse plasma were mixed with 900 μL of 2% formic acid aqueous solution (v/v), vortexed and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min. 950 μL of the supernatant was load onto conditioned Strata X (33μm, 30mg, 1 mL) SPE cartridge (Phenomenex), washed 2 times with 1mL of 5% methanol aqueous solution and eluted with 900 μL of 1% formic acid solution in acetonitrile (v/v). The eluent was evaporated using a Genevac EZ-2 at 40 °C, reconstituted in 200 μL of mobile phase solution (acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid, 1:1, v/v), and subjected to UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Calibration was performed against external calibration standard solutions.

UPLC was carried out using the Waters Acquity UPLC system equipped with the Acquity BEH C8 column (2.1 × 75mm, 1.7 μm). The mobile phase consisted of A (aqueous 0.1% formic acid) and B (acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min, using a gradient elution: Initial – 50% B, 2.5 min–98% B, 4.5 min–98% B, 4.7 min −50% B, 6 min–50% B. The injection volume was 5 μL.

MS/MS analysis was performed on a Micromass Quattro MicroTM tandem mass spectrometer in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring of the transition from m/z 222.2 to 205.2 (cone voltage 25V, collision energy 20eV). Quantitative analysis was achieved using QuanLynx 4.1 software (Waters, Milford, USA).

2.4 Chemicals
(+)-MK-801 hydrogen maleate (5S,10R)-(+)-5-Methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, Missouri, USA). Ethanol was purchased from LAKO Ltd. (Riga, Latvia). 0.9% physiological saline was purchased from Fresenius Kabi (Warszawa, Poland). Acetonitrile and methanol were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).

2.5 Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). MK-801 concentrations in brain tissue and blood plasma were analyzed using unpaired Student's t-tests. P values less than 0.05 were significant. The statistical calculations were performed using the GraphPad Prism 3.0 software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA).
