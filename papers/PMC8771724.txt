Aims

Quality of clozapine clinic appointment

Effectiveness of clozapine clinic servive

Compliance with BCUHB guidelines for physical health monitoring in clozapine clinics

We retrospectively audited 40 case notes 10 each from 4 differtent CMHT clozapine clinics

My role in the Project & How does this represent my practice? I was the audit and overall lead for this project

I formulated the audit tool and registered my project with Audit Registration Team

I lead data collection and compilation of results

Background

This audit followed up from a Coroner's investigation for a clozapine clinic patient

Clozapine is used for Treatment Resistant Schizophrenia but needs close monitoring due to potentially fatal side effects

NICE recommends annual monitoring of weight, blood pressure, waist measurement, blood glucose and plasma lipid levels

Method

Has the patient been seen in the past year by clinician to monitor response to clozapine treatment?

Has the clozapine plasma level been measured during the last year of treatment?

Is brief MSE & Risk assessment documented during review?

Has Life style modification advice been provided?

Has annual physical health been completed?

Has Annual CTP/CPA been completed and documented?

Has the patient been allocated a named care coordinator?

Has clozapine side effects monitoring been documented?

Conclusion

Clozapine is a superior medication for the treatment of refractory schizophrenia and is also be effective for other conditions

Clozapine is underused due to a variety of barriers related to the drug and its properties, the health care system & regulatory requirements

This service evaluation/quality improvement project provides the framework for clozapine clinics evaluation and recommends strategies for improvement
