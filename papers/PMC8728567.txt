Objective:

In light of the substantial clinical and societal burden of social phobia (SP) and impact on the sense of well-being of affected individuals, we sought to summarise extant data related to quality of life and relevant correlates in adults with SP to distill clinical profiles for earlier identification and appropriate management.

Methods:

A scoping review was carried out on studies examining quality of life in adults with SP and clinical correlates within different settings. PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant articles beginning from database inception until May 2021.

Results:

A total of 25 papers were included. Most of the studies (92%) were cross sectional in nature (80%), conducted in the West (92%), and within clinic or community settings (88%). Patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions, and undergraduate students reported higher rates of SP compared with community population. Significant correlates of SP included demographic (such as females, younger age, living alone, fewer years of education, unemployment) and clinical factors (such as family history of anxiety disorders, suicidal ideas, avoidant personality features). SP was widely associated with decreased QoL involving several domains and especially related to complexity, greater number of feared or trigger situations, and comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions.

Conclusion:

SP is not uncommon within clinical, and undergraduate populations, and has a significantly negative impact on quality of life. Awareness of its associated clinical profiles allows better identification and overall management of this condition including improvement in QoL.

pmc1 INTRODUCTION

Social Phobia (SP), also known as Social Anxiety Disorder, is a potentially debilitating condition characterised by the marked fear or anxiety regarding social or performance situations related to potential scrutiny and negative evaluation by others, with lifetime prevalence estimates of up to 16% in high income countries [1, 2], and can result in functional impairments involving occupational, social and academic domains within affected individuals [1, 3]. In addition, the presence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities may further compound the negative impact of SP on an individual [4-6]. Of note, SP remains under-treated and under-recognised despite its substantial clinical and societal burden, and it was reported that the annual per capita total costs for SP were substantially higher compared with those without mental disorder [7-9]. The nature of the condition also means that individuals suffering from SP are more likely to worry about the social consequences that arise from help-seeking, such as treatment stigma or fear of being negatively judged by healthcare providers [10]. This delay in help-seeking could result in a prolonged and significant impact on their quality of life.

For patients with SP, the quality of life (QoL) can be affected to varying degrees and relates to the personal (self-realisation, work, education, etc.) and interpersonal (social relationships) arenas [6]. Over time, there has been increasing interest in examining the health-related QoL amongst individuals with SP within different contexts (such as students, within the community, those with existing medical conditions) [3, 8, 11-13] and related to different subtypes of the condition (such as complexity of fears) [14]. Given that individuals with SP often delay seeking help, an understanding of the interrelationships between QoL and specific demographic and clinical features of SP identified through the review could give clinicians a better idea of what to look out for during routine patient examinations. This provides an opportunity for early identification and intervention so as to optimize the overall clinical management of the disorder. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no recent review done that broadly summarizes findings across different contexts and subtypes of SP.

In view of the clinical import of SP and impact on one’s sense of well-being in various domains, we conducted a scoping review to summarise the actual data pertaining to QoL in adults with SP and determine the salient associated clinical features.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the methodology of the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews and we followed the five steps framework to guide the process [15, 16]. The first step involves identifying the main research questions addressed within our review, which were:

(1) What are the relevant demographic and clinical correlates of SP?

(2) What is the impact of SP on QoL and associated factors within the sufferers?

The second step involves identifying relevant studies. We searched the PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases for relevant studies that examined QoL in adults with SP from database inception until May 2021. Keywords and combinations used for the literature search were (quality of life) OR (QOL) AND (adults) AND (social phobia) OR (social anxiety disorder), as well as MeSH (Phobia, Social). Papers were selected for inclusion if they 1) included individuals with SP either within cross-sectional or prospective studies, 2) age group 18 years and older, 3) were focused on examining QoL and 4) were written in English. Papers were excluded if they 1) did not include adults with SP in the sample, and 2) were case reports or opinion pieces.

The third step involves study selection. We manually screened the abstracts of identified reports to ascertain whether they met the inclusion criteria, then reviewed full reports of promising studies. Two independent reviewers simultaneously screened the titles and abstracts. In case of any inconsistency between reviewers, the disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer.

The fourth and fifth steps involve charting, collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. For each included study, we extracted variables including the characteristics of subjects, measure of QOL, and the salient findings. The preceding data was organized within digitalized spreadsheets and then summarized into a table to help facilitate critical assessments and for independent consideration by readers. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (PRISMA) flowchart for this review is shown in Fig. (1) [17].

3 RESULTS

3.1 General features of studies and prevalence of SP

We evaluated 40 studies for eligibility and excluded 15 articles due to reasons such as a) child or adolescent sample only, b) QOL was not the main outcome of interest, c) participants with social phobia were a minority in the sample of interest (≤ 1%). Overall, 25 papers were included in this review and the characteristics of these studies are summarised in Table 1. The majority of the studies were conducted either in the Americas or Europe (N=23, 92%) with a preponderance of cross-sectional studies (N=20, 80%). The nature of the study setting included clinics (N=14, 56%%), community (N=8, 32%) and university undergraduates (N=3, 12%). In terms of prevalence of SP, the rates varied depending on the context. Within community settings, the rates varied from 2.1% to 7.1% [4, 12-14]. Within patients with comorbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia, the rates ranged between 12.7% to 17% [4, 18]. Within university undergraduates, studies have reported rates of up to 37.6% [3, 8].

3.2 Demographic and Clinical Correlates

Regarding gender, SP seems to affect females more than males within the community [4, 13, 14] and undergraduates [3, 8, 19]. In community-based studies, there is greater preponderance of females being associated with SP up to 1.6 fold [14]. Within undergraduates, using logistic regression analysis, one study showed that being female was associated with SP [3], while another showed that the risk of SP was 1.7-fold higher among females than males [19]. In a clinic sample of patients undergoing bariatric surgery with SP, Mirijello et al. [20] found that males have a lower propensity than females to meet the cut-off for a diagnosis of SP when measured with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Pertaining to age, there is some suggestion of SP being associated with younger age in two community based studies [13, 14].

Clinical factors associated with SP included family history of anxiety or psychiatric disorders, history of suicidal ideas/attempts, avoidant personality features [3, 8, 18, 19]. In terms of limited treatment studies, three separate studies which employed Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in adults with SP [21, 22] and unguided Internet based self-help intervention [23] amongst undergraduate students with SP respectively observed improvements in QoL upon follow up over time.

Some sociodemographic factors associated with SP included being single/divorced/separated [24], living alone [13] or in cities [19], being less well-educated [13], current tobacco use [3], and embarrassment with own socioeconomic status [8], but not social class or personal income [14].

3.3 Impact of Social Situation on QoL

The presence of SP was correlated with an overall decrease in QoL in the majority of included studies [3, 8, 19, 25] and affected specific QoL domains as measured using rating tools. For example, using the Short Form 36 (SF-36), individuals with SP showed greater impairments in the following dimensions, namely, vitality, role limitations related to physical, emotional and social functioning, and mental health [6, 11, 26]. Studies that utilized scales other than SF-36 have also reported problems in these specific QOL domains [12, 25, 27].

Within SP, there exists two different subtypes, namely Generalised Social Phobia (GSP) and Non-Generalised Social Phobia (NGSP) (or Specific SP) [28]. GSP is characterised by the individual with SP facing distress over a wide range of social situations, while NGSP is limited to a few situations (such as public speaking). Comparing across the two subtypes of SP, GSP reported worse QoL relative to NGSP, while NGSP reported QoL that was not significantly different from the healthy control group [28]. In another study, patients who have complex fears subtype of SP (equivalent to GSP) reported poorer QoL compared to the specific public speaking subtype (equivalent to NGSP) [14]. Of note, poorer QoL was associated with a greater number of feared situations in SP, increased comorbidity and service utilization [13]. In addition, the number of trigger situations related to SP was found to be the strongest predictor of reductions in QoL as measured by SF-36, but not the duration of illness, age of onset of SP or depressive scores [26].

3.4 Influence of Comorbidities on QOL in the Presence of SP

In terms of comorbidities, patients with medical and psychiatric conditions and co-occurring SP generally suffered from poor QoL [4, 5, 13, 14, 18, 28, 29]. Regarding medical comorbidities, SP was found to be significantly more prevalent and associated with lower QoL scores in patients with vitiligo and acne [29] and morbid obesity awaiting bariatric surgery [20] compared to healthy controls. For example, the percentage of patients showing SP in morbidly obese patients awaiting bariatric surgery was significantly higher (43%) compared to a sample of healthy controls (16%) [20]. Patients awaiting bariatric surgery showed lower QoL scores compared with those who had undergone surgery [20]. In a recent study of patients with hemifacial spasms, those with comorbid SP had lower QoL in domains including vitality, role limitations pertaining to physical and emotional areas [11]. However, 6 months after microvascular decompression for the hemifacial spasm, there were improvements in the anxiety level as well as QoL, which were sustained at 36 months.

Pertaining to co-occurring psychiatric conditions, the prevalence of SP amongst patients with schizophrenia was 17% in an earlier study [18] but lower at 12.7% within patients with PTSD in a more recent study [4]. The comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders was linearly correlated with the number of social fears, with 92% of respondents with five or six fears reporting a comorbid anxiety disorder, and 56% reporting a comorbid mood disorder [13]. Patients with schizophrenia and SP had lower QoL and associated earlier onset of illness, greater severity of illness, increased depressive symptoms, self-stigmatisation, harm avoidance and lower levels of hope, self-esteem and self-directedness [5, 18]. Of note, lower QOL had a greater association with rates of anxiety and depression than with symptoms of schizophrenia in one study [18]. Patients with PTSD and SP were also observed to have lower QoL and greater risk of lifetime suicide [4]. Across anxiety conditions, lower QoL was found in General Anxiety Disorder, SP and Panic Disorder [25, 30]. However, the Social Functioning domain was more impaired in SP compared to other anxiety conditions and amongst SP, QoL was negatively correlated with functional impairment and depressive features [25, 27].

4 DISCUSSION

There are several main findings from this review. First, the prevalence of SP varied from 2.1-7.1% amongst the community population, 12.7-17% amongst patients with psychiatric comorbidity and up to 37.6% amongst undergraduates. Second, correlates of SP included demographic (such as females, younger age, living alone, fewer years of education, unemployment) and clinical factors (such as family history of anxiety disorders, suicidal ideas, avoidant personality features). Third, SP was widely associated with decreased QoL involving several domains and especially related to complexity, greater number of feared or trigger situations, and comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions.

The prevalence of SP within community population (2.1%-7.1%) is consistent with findings of an earlier study which reported a rate of 5.8% [31]. Amongst individuals with co-occurring psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and PTSD, the rates of SP were higher (12.7%-17%), which behoove clinicians to be attentive to the possible presence of SP and address its management so as to optimise overall care for these patients. It is intriguing that the prevalence rates are even higher amongst undergraduates (up to 37.6%) from extant data, which is consistent with other studies which did not include examination of QOL amongst university students [32-34]. There could be several possible explanations. As SP is associated with younger age [13, 35], there is a naturally higher prevalence amongst the undergraduate population. Other correlates with SP included singlehood, living alone, and unemployment [6, 13, 26], which are common demographic features of these students including those that travel from far away to enroll for their university studies. Within the university, it may be the first time that the undergraduate student is exposed to a bigger group of colleagues, which can pose challenges to individuals with avoidant personality features [19]. In the course of study, their academic progress can also influence their condition as poor academic results [8] have been associated with SP. Of note, SP can be associated with a family history of anxiety disorders and suicidal ideas or attempts [8, 19]. This also highlights the need to identify SP and its associated risk factors amongst undergraduate learners early so that they can be encouraged to seek help whenever appropriate and needed. This can be a conjoint partnership between the students, faculty, university healthcare centres and involve psychoeducation about SP, de-stigmatisation, and providing access to psychiatric services and support of the learners.

Across mental disorders, the highest levels of disability and loss of QoL were found in people with three or more mental disorders in the last 12 months [36], with the loss of QoL showing a dose–response relationship with the number of mental disorders including SP [36]. Independently, SP was associated with lower QoL across the majority of studies and affected different domains including physical, psychological, and social aspects [3, 19]. It was one of the five mental disorders with the strongest association with poorer QOL [36], highlighting the extensive impact on the sense of well-being of the sufferers. The association of poor QoL with complex, generalised SP, and greater number of feared and trigger situations in SP underscore the direct relationship between severity of illness and overall sense of wellbeing. Of note, poor QOL had a stronger association with SP or anxiety-related factors as compared to depressive symptoms [26] or schizophrenia [18]. The association of SP with comorbid physical and psychiatric conditions reflects the incremental burden of medical and psychiatric illnesses, hence prompt and timely management of underlying and co-occurring conditions can ameliorate the overall morbidity, which can also improve the QoL [18]. This is evident from studies where patients who received treatment for their physical condition reported better QOL than those who had not [11, 20]. Sparse treatment studies with CBT, exposure therapy, and internet based self-help approaches suggested positive improvements of anxiety in SP as well as QoL over a period of follow-up [21-24]. This provides hope for individuals with SP that they can benefit from such psychotherapeutic and online approaches, which also improves QoL.

There are several limitations for this review. First, we limit the review to adults with SP and the impact on QoL, hence the data may not be generalisable to younger or much older individuals. Second, there are relatively fewer treatment studies. Third, there are also fewer prospective studies to evaluate the evolution of SP and inter-relationship with QoL and related factors over time.

Future studies may want to examine larger groups of SP and associated clinical correlations over time from different collaborating sites and compare wider settings to facilitate better generalisability of the findings. There is a need to investigate the effectiveness of current and future non-pharmacological treatments delivered over the virtual platform, which will facilitate the delivery of effective treatments for SP in spite of difficulties with face-to-face meetings due to various reasons such as distance, travel restrictions, and infection control measures.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, SP occurs not uncommonly within community, clinical and undergraduate populations and is often associated with poor QoL. The relationship between clinical features of SP and comorbidity with poor QoL warrants earlier identification of SP so that it can be addressed in a timely way with current and future treatment approaches.

8,116 subjects in community, out of which 1,116 with SP (lifetime)
Females 60.6% (SP group)
Mean age: Not stated	Quality of Well-Being Scale		One-year and lifetime prevalence rates of SP were 6.7% and 13.0% respectively, associated with extensive functional disability, less life satisfaction, and a lower quality of well-being, especially with complex fears SP subtype
Lifetime SP was associated with being female, being young, lifetime major depression, failing a grade, not significantly associated with social class or personal income	
Wittchen et al., 1999
Germany [6]	Cross-sectional study
150 subjects with SP
(65 had current pure SP and no comorbidity
51 comorbid subjects with current threshold SP
- All had lifetime or current diagnoses of major depression and/or dysthymia. Most had additional lifetime diagnosis.
34 cases of subthreshold SP (All diagnostic criteria except current impairment)
65 Healthy Controls
Females: 63.1% (pure SP), 60.8% (comorbid), 58.8% (subthreshold), 63.1% (controls)
Mean age: 36.9 (pure SP), 38.0 (comorbid), 35.4 (subthreshold), 37.2 (controls)	SF-36	Liebowitz disability self-rating scale (LDSRS)
Health service use inventory (HSUI)	QOL was significantly reduced in SP, particularly in scales measuring vitality, general health, mental health, role limitations due to emotional health, and social functioning	
Safren et al., 1996
USA [24]	Cross-sectional study
44 subjects at clinic
Females 65%
Mean age 35.80+/-10.42 years	QoL Inventory (QOLI)	Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS); Clinical Global Impression; Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS); SP Scale (SPS)	QoL of SP was significantly lower than the other patients, esp in singles/divorced/separated, improved with CBT group treatment for SP	
Wittchen & Beloch, 1996
Germany [26]	Cross-sectional study
65 Pure SP, Females 63.1%, Mean age 36.9 years
65 Controls, Females 63.1%, Mean age 37.2 years	SF-36	Reilly Work Productivity and Impairment questionnaire (WPAI)
Health Service Use Inventory (HSUI)	SP associated with lower QOL especially vitality, general health, mental health, role limitations due to emotional health and social functioning.
WPAI was significantly diminished in SP
Number of SP trigger situations was found to be strongest predictor of QoL reductions, not duration of illness, age of onset, depression
