Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism through the kynurenine pathway (KP) is well known to play a critical function in cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. However, its role in host-pathogen interactions has not been characterized yet. Herein, we identified that kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO), a key rate-limiting enzyme in the KP, and quinolinic acid (QUIN), a key enzymatic product of KMO enzyme, exerted a novel antiviral function against a broad range of viruses. Mechanistically, QUIN induced the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) via activating the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and Ca2+ influx to activate Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)/interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Importantly, QUIN treatment effectively inhibited viral infections and alleviated disease progression in mice. Furthermore, kmo-/- mice were vulnerable to pathogenic viral challenge with severe clinical symptoms. Collectively, our results demonstrated that KMO and its enzymatic product QUIN were potential therapeutics against emerging pathogenic viruses.

Author summary

The outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases have become a severe challenge worldwide, and therefore it is a public health priority to explore novel broad-spectrum antiviral agents with various mechanisms. This study reported that kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO), a key rate-limiting enzyme during tryptophan metabolism, showed promise as a novel broad-spectrum antiviral factor against emerging pathogenic viruses. We further found that quinolinic acid (QUIN), an enzymatic product of KMO, could also act as a novel broad-spectrum antiviral agent. We then systematically studied the underlying mechanisms and broadly antiviral function of KMO and QUIN in vitro and in vivo. Our data highlight the importance of exploring novel antiviral targets from the key enzymes and their metabolites in tryptophan metabolism.

Frequent outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, avian influenza H5N8, Zika virus (ZIKV), and Ebola virus (EBOV), have become a serious threat to global public health [1–6], and an urgent need in clinical practice is to explore the efficient and broad-spectrum antiviral agents against various viral infections. Increasing studies indicated the potential cross-talk between the immune responses to viral infections and the cellular metabolism in host cells [7,8]. In addition, viral infections may hijack the immune system and the metabolic system and thus cause metabolic disorders, including abnormal lipid metabolism, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases [9–11]. As a result, in-depth investigation of the relationship between immune response and cellular metabolism may reveal novel targets to develop antiviral agents.

L-Tryptophan (L-Try) is a kind of essential amino acid for the human body, and its metabolites by the kynurenine pathway (KP) have critical functions in inflammation and immune homeostasis, thereby playing a key role in autoimmune diseases, tumorigenesis, and neurodegenerative diseases [12–15]. Recent studies also suggested that KP metabolites might play a regulatory role in host-pathogen interactions [16–18]. For example, the transcription level of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), one metabolite of tryptophan, was significantly upregulated in response to influenza infection in mouse lungs and human primary macrophages [19,20]. Moreover, kynurenine biosynthesis in macrophages was increased in response to stimulation by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharides [21]. In addition, another metabolite of KP-picolinic acid effectively induced the apoptosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or HSV-infected cells [22]. Thus, it is important to investigate further the host-pathogen interactions through the KP metabolites to explore the novel anti-infection targets.

Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO), a key rate-limiting enzyme during L-Try metabolism, belongs to the family of oxidoreductases. KMO can catalyze the conversion of L-kynurenine to 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine and also regulate the balance between kynurenic acid (KA) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) [15]. So far, the role of KMO in innate immunity response to viral infections has not been reported yet. In the present study, we identified for the first time that KMO and its enzymatic product QUIN could act as a novel broad-spectrum antiviral factor against emerging pathogenic viruses.

Result

KMO is an interferon-dependent gene

To identify the potential genes with antiviral activity, we used a recombinant HSV-GFP-Luc reporter virus to screen the 288 ISGs induced by IFN-α and IFN-γ as we previously reported [23]. Besides the well-known antiviral genes including IRF1 [24], CH25H [25], IFITM2 [26], TAP1 [27], LY6E [28], we also identified some novel genes including KMO, SERPINA5, SLFN12, GPR146, and LIPG, which are uncharacterized with antiviral activity previously (Fig 1A). Our further analysis demonstrated that IFITM2, KMO, LIPG genes exerted the most obvious inhibition against viral infections in this study (Fig 1B).

10.1371/journal.ppat.1010366.g001 Fig 1 The expression of KMO is interferon-inducible.

(A,B) 288 genes were screened by a luciferase-based analysis. Each dot represents one gene, and its effect on HSV-1 infection was normalized to that in pVAX-GFP transfected cells (negative control). Genes that inhibit HSV-1 infection by more than 50% were marked and shown in green. Genes that enhance HSV-1 infection by more than 2 fold were marked and shown in red. (C) Wild type bone marrow-derived macrophage (WT-J2-BMM) cells or interferon α receptor-deficient (Ifnar-/-)-J2-BMM cells were stimulated for 8 h with different TLR agonists, including LPS (1 μg/mL), R848 (100 nM), poly(I:C) (25 μg/mL), and then the expression level of kmo gene was measured by RT-qPCR. (D) Raw264.7 cells and J2-BMM cells were stimulated with IFN-α in different concentrations (500 U/mL, 1000 U/mL, and 2000 U /mL) for 8 h, and the expression level of the kmo gene was measured by RT-qPCR. (E) Raw264.7 cells were infected with indicated MOI of HSV-1 for 24 h or infected with various times (hours post-infection, hpi.) at 0.25 MOI of HSV-1. Then, the expression level of the kmo gene was measured by RT-qPCR. (F) J2-BMM cells and Ifnar-/—J2-BMM cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL), poly(I:C) (25 μg/mL), R848 (100 nM), IFN-α (2000 U/mL), or HSV-1 at MOI of 0.25 for 24 h, respectively, and then the expression level of KMO protein was measured by Western Blotting Analysis. GAPDH was used as intern control. The final data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least triplicate experiments. MOI: multiplicity of infection. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

Next, we sought to characterize the antiviral function of the KMO gene since it was previously well-described as a key rate-limiting enzyme in KP-mediated L-Try metabolism [29]. Our results showed that KMO expression was significantly upregulated in response to the stimulation of different toll-like receptors (TLRs) agonists, such as LPS, poly(I:C), R848 (Fig 1C). However, the up-regulation of KMO expression was abrogated in the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) deficient (Ifnar-/-)-J2-BMMs (Fig 1C). In addition, in a dose-dependent manner, KMO expression was significantly induced by IFN-α stimulation in Raw264.7 and WT-J2-BMM cells (Fig 1D). We also found that KMO expression was significantly elevated by HSV-1 infection in both dose-dependent and time-dependent in Raw264.7 cells (Fig 1E). The Western Blotting analysis further confirmed that KMO protein was increased by the agonists mentioned above in J2-BMM cells while abolished in the (Ifna-/-)-J2-BMM cells (Fig 1F). Altogether, the KMO expression is IFN-dependent.

The antiviral activity of KMO

Next, we investigated the potential antiviral activity of KMO. Using the CH25H gene as a positive control [30], we demonstrated that KMO over-expression significantly suppressed the replication of HSV-1 by quantitative PCR analysis (Fig 2A), and this inhibition was further confirmed by Western Blotting analysis (Fig 2B) and plaque assay (Fig 2C). To further validate the antiviral function of KMO, the KMO expression was effectively inhibited using small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig 2D) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Fig 2E), respectively. Results demonstrated that HSV-1 replication was significantly enhanced in KMO-knockdown cells compared to wild-type cells (Figs 2D and 3E). Furthermore, we generated the kmo-/- cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig 2F) and found a significantly enhanced HSV-1 replication in kmo-/- cells (Fig 2G) compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Moreover, the replenishment of the kmo gene could effectively rescue the antiviral activity in kmo-/- cells (Fig 2H). Altogether, our studies with both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments validated the antiviral function of the kmo gene.

The antiviral effects of KMO through its enzymatic product QUIN

We also explored whether the antiviral function of KMO is dependent on its enzyme activity. Previous studies showed that the residues Tyr 99, Tyr 194, and Glu 366 were critical to the enzymatic activity of KMO [31,32], and we subsequently generated a series of kmo mutants (KMO-M1-3) by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig 2I). Results showed that the overexpression of these KMO enzyme-dead mutants had no significant inhibition effect on HSV-1 infection compared to that of wild-type KMO (Fig 2J), implying that the enzymatic activity of KMO is required for its antiviral function.

We subsequently assessed whether the enzymatic products in the supernatants of KMO-treated cell cultures exerted the viral inhibition effect. As expected, the supernatants from KMO-treated cells significantly inhibited HSV-1 infection in Vero cells and 293T cells (Fig 2K), and Western Blotting analysis further confirmed this observation (Fig 2L), suggesting that KMO exerted antiviral function by producing potential soluble antiviral factors. KMO is a well-known key enzyme in the KP to produce many kinds of metabolites [29–33], including quinolinic acid (QUIN), kynurenic acid, xanthic acid. Among them, we identified that QUIN had a significant antiviral effect in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2M). Moreover, QUIN also effectively rescues the antiviral activity in kmo-/- cells (S1 Fig). In addition, we investigated the cytotoxicity of QUIN, and the QUIN under 1 mM showed no obvious toxicity to different cell lines, including 293T, Vero, and Raw264.7 cells (S2 Fig).

The antiviral mechanisms of KMO and QUIN by activating IRF3-mediated IFN-β production in HSV-1 infected cells

We next investigated the underlying mechanisms for the antiviral function of KMO and QUIN in HSV-1 infected cells. To clarify the possible roles of QUIN in antiviral immunity, we performed RNA-seq analyses for the HSV-1-infected RAW264.7 cells with or without QUIN treatment. Compared to the control group, QUIN treatment significantly altered the expression of 245 genes (161 upregulated and 84 downregulated) (S3A Fig). Gene ontology (GO) analyses showed that QUIN treatment upregulated the expression of multiple genes related to IFN-I production, cytokine production, cellular metabolic process (S3B Fig). KEGG analyses revealed enrichment in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway (S3C Fig). After hierarchical clustering, we identified 19 genes involved in the antiviral signaling pathway by QUIN treatment (S3D Fig). These data suggested that QUIN and KMO might play the antiviral function by regulating IFN-I production and related signaling pathways and so on.

Consistent with these data, the over-expression of KMO significantly elicited the level of IFN-β expression in Raw 264.7 cells (Fig 3A). In contrast, siRNA or shRNA-mediated KMO knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KMO knockout had significantly reduced the levels of IFN-β expression (Fig 3B–3D). Moreover, R061-8048, an inhibitor of KMO enzyme activity, could also inhibit the IFN-β production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3E). In addition, QUIN treatment significantly induced the IFN-β production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3F). These data suggested that induction of interferon production may contribute to the antiviral activity of KMO and QUIN.

We then studied the signaling pathway involved in KMO/QUIN-induced IFN-β production in HSV-infected cells and found that KMO over-expression effectively activated the phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser396 (pSer396) (Fig 3G). Meanwhile, QUIN had a similar effect on the activation of IRF3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3H). In contrast, KMO knockdown significantly decreased the phosphorylation of IRF3 in HSV-infected cells and consequently increased the expression of HSV-1 ICP27 protein (Fig 3I). Moreover, KMO inhibitor R061-8048 also suppressed the phosphorylation of IRF3 in response to HSV-1 infection (Fig 3J). Overall, these data indicated that KMO/QUIN promoted IFN-β production by enhancing IRF3 phosphorylation in HSV-infected cells.

Subsequently, we explored how KMO/QUIN modulated the IRF3 phosphorylation. QUIN was previously reported as an agonist of NMDAR to induce the Ca2+ influx [34,35]. In our study, we first validated the NMDAR expression in various cell lines (S4 Fig), and then we determined whether QUIN could elicit Ca2+ influx. Using Calbryte 520 to visually label the intracellular Ca2+, an immediate increase of the intracellular Ca2+ was observed after QUIN stimulation in Raw 264.7 cells, while this increase of Ca2+ influx was significantly suppressed in the samples treated with (-)-MK-801 (Fig 3K), which is an NMDAR inhibitor [36].

Considering that the increased Ca2+ influx can trigger IFN-I production through the Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and IRF3 signaling pathway [37], we further determined whether KMO/QUIN modulated the phosphorylation of CaMKII, which is a major biochemical decoder of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations [38]. Results showed that KMO over-expression enhanced while KMO knockdown reduced the CaMKII phosphorylation (T286) in HSV-1 infected cells (Fig 3L). A similar observation of increased CaMKII phosphorylation (T286) was also observed with QUIN incubation (Fig 3M). In contrast, the QUIN-induced CaMKII phosphorylation was significantly inhibited in the presence of the KMO inhibitor (Ro 61–8048) (Fig 3N), (-)-MK-801(Fig 3O) or siCaMKII (Fig 3P). We have demonstrated a direct interaction between CaMKII and IRF3 in QUIN-stimulated cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3Q). Taken together, KMO/QUIN induced the production of IFN-I via activating the NMDAR/Ca2+ influx to trigger the CaMKII/IRF3 signaling pathway.

Broadly antiviral activity of KMO and QUIN

As KMO had a novel function against viral infection by enhancing IFN-I induction, we wanted to determine the breadth of antiviral activity of KMO. Our results demonstrated that KMO could effectively inhibit the replication of DNA viruses, such as HSV-1 (a kind of enveloped DNA virus) and adenovirus (a kind of nonenveloped DNA virus) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4A and 4B). Moreover, we also found that KMO had a significant antiviral effect against RNA viruses, such as negative-strand RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza virus (PR8) (Fig 4C and 4G), and positive-stranded RNA viruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV) and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4D and 4F). In addition, we found that KMO significantly enhanced IFN-β expression during infection with the viruses mentioned above (S5A Fig). Similarly, QUIN treatment also had dose-dependent inhibitory effects on these viruses by stimulating the production of IFN-β (Figs 4H–4N, and S5B). We found that QUIN also has broad antiviral activity in various cells, including A549 and BMM cells (S6 Fig). Thus, our data showed that KMO/QUIN exerted an unreported function to inhibit DNA viruses and RNA viruses broadly.

The expression level of mRNA was normalized to the expression of β-actin, and the data from at least triplicates were shown as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

Previous studies have reported that IDO1 played a function in inhibiting viral replication [39,40]. To clarify that KMO and QUIN have antiviral activities independent of IDO1, we treated cells with 1-Methyl-D-tryptophan(1-MT), an inhibitor of IDO1. We found that 1-MT treatment weakened the antiviral effect by inhibiting IDO1 (S7A and S7B Fig). However, KMO and QUIN treatment could rescue the antiviral effect even after the IDO1 inhibition by 1-MT (S7C and S7D Fig), indicating that the antiviral effects of KMO and QUIN were independent on IDO1.

QUIN treatment protected mice from viral infections

Next, we sought to investigate the efficacy of QUIN as a potential antiviral agent against viral infections in vivo. Mice were infected with highly pathogenic HSV-1 McKrae strain, followed by daily treatment with QUIN for 7 days (Fig 5A). We also used the acyclovir (ACV) as a positive control, a clinical drug prescribed to control herpes infection. At 7 days post-infection (dpi.), the vehicle group’s progressive corneal scarring and visual impairment deteriorated significantly, while this symptom was greatly alleviated in the QUIN and the ACV groups (Fig 5B). More importantly, QUIN administration effectively protected mice and significantly improved their survival when challenged with the highly pathogenic HSV-1 McKrae strain, while all of the mice in the vehicle group succumbed to this lethal challenge within 7 dpi (Fig 5C). Consistent with this finding, mice treated with QUIN had significantly lower disease scores when compared to the vehicle group (Fig 5D).

10.1371/journal.ppat.1010366.g005 Fig 5 QUIN treatment protected mice from viral infections.

(A) Schedule for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of QUIN in mice. Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were corneally inoculated with 105 PFU HSV-1 McKrae strain and treated daily with QUIN for 7 days. The vehicle group (negative control) was received intraperitoneal (IP) injection of DMSO and PBS. QUIN group was received an IP injection of QUIN (2.5 mg/kg). The ACV group (positive control) received an IP injection of ACV (5 mg/kg). The eyes of mice were washed at 2 dpi and 4 dpi to perform the plaque assay. The disease symptoms of experimental mice were monitored until 15 dpi. (B) The representative picture of progressive corneal scarring, visual impairment of experimental mice in different groups at 7 dpi. (C) Survival curve of experimental mice in different groups over time post-infection (n = 8). (D) Statistical analysis of disease scores of experimental mice in different groups over time (n = 5). Score 0, healthy; Score 4, being severe disease. (E) The HSV-1 titer in the eye washing fluid at 2 dpi and 4 dpi were measured by plaque assay (n = 5 per group). (F) The concentration of IFN-β in serum, brain, and spleen of experimental mice at 5 dpi was measured by ELISA assay (n = 5 per group). (G) The frequency of HSV-1 antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays at 5 dpi. Data represents spot-forming cells (SFC) per million cells. The final data are presented as the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

In addition, the viral copies in the eye washing fluid from QUIN-treated mice were significantly reduced than that of mock-treated mice (Fig 5E). We also quantitatively measured the concentration of IFN-β in serum, brain, and spleen of these experimental mice and found a significant increase of IFN-β secretion in the QUIN-treated mice than that of mock-treated mice (Fig 5F). Furthermore, there was an increased frequency of HSV-1 antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells, determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays, in the QUIN group compared to that of the vehicle group (Fig 5G), implying that QUIN therapy also modulated the adaptive immune responses, especially the antigen-specific cellular immune responses. Collectively, these data indicated that QUIN treatment effectively protected mice from viral infection.

kmo-/- mice are more susceptible to viral infections

Finally, to determine whether KMO played a physiological role in host defense against viral infections, we generated the kmo-/- mice by CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy (S8 Fig) and then compared whether there was an increased susceptibility to viral infections in kmo-/- mice as compared to the age-matched wild-type mice (kmo+/+). After challenging with sub-lethal doses of highly pathogenic HSV-1 McKrae strain (Fig 6A), kmo-/- mice developed a more severe disease progression and clinical symptoms, leading to a significantly lower survival rate than that of kmo+/+ mice (Fig 6B). Furthermore, plaque assay indicated that the viral copies in the eye washing fluid from kmo-/- mice were significantly higher than kmo+/+ mice (Fig 6C). Our data also showed that peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages from the kmo-/- mice were more susceptible to HSV-1 infection than that of kmo+/+ mice (Fig 6D). Consistent with the above in vitro data (Fig 3D), the level of IFN-β expression in serum, brain, and spleen of kmo-/- mice was significantly lower than that of kmo+/+ mice (Fig 6E and 6F). In addition, we further showed that there was an obvious dysfunction of adaptive T cell immune responses in kmo-/- mice, characteristic with the decreased frequency of the polyfunctional CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells secreting interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) cytokines (Fig 6G).

10.1371/journal.ppat.1010366.g006 Fig 6 kmo-/- mice are more susceptible to viral infections.

(A) Schedule for evaluating the susceptibility to viral infections in kmo-/- mice. Briefly, both kmo+/+ C57BL/6 mice and kmo-/- C57BL/6 mice were corneally inoculated with 3×104 PFU HSV-1 McKrae strain, disease symptoms of experimental mice were monitored until 15 dpi. (B) Survival curve and disease score of experimental mice in different groups over time post-infection (n = 8 per group). (C) The HSV-1 titer in the eye washing fluid at 3 dpi and 5 dpi was measured by plaque assay (n = 5 per group). (D) Bone Marrow-derived and Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from kmo+/+ or kmo-/- mice and then infected with HSV-1-Luc at MOI of 0.25 for 8 h. Then, the luciferase expression was measured by Luciferase Assay kit (n = 5 per group). (E) The concentration of IFN-β in serum, brain, and spleen of experimental mice at 7 dpi was measured by ELISA assay (n = 5 per group). (F) The expression of IFN-β in the brain and spleen of kmo+/+ or kmo-/- mice were measured by RT-qPCR (n = 5 per group). (G) The frequency of polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in kmo+/+ or kmo-/-mice was assessed by detecting the secretion of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2 cytokines response to HSV-1 peptide pool stimulation. (H) The pathological changes of experimental mice’s liver, spleen, and trigeminal ganglia (TG) were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining at 7dpi. The scale bars: 100 μm. (I) The numbers of white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (Lym), monocyte (Mon), granulocyte (Gran) in HSV-1 infected kmo-/- mice and kmo+/+ mice were detected by complete blood count analysis at 7 dpi (n = 5 per group). The final data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least triplicate experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

We also performed immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining to examine the pathological changes in the tissues of these experimental mice. Compared with kmo+/+ mice, the McKrae HSV-1 infected kmo-/- mice had the increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia (black arrow) and focal infiltration of inflammatory cells (red arrow) in the liver lobules, and the increased neutrophil infiltration in the red pulp of the spleen (black arrow) (Fig 6H). Importantly, an obvious pathological injury was observed in the trigeminal ganglia in kmo-/- mice, characteristic with the increased neuron necrosis (black arrow), decreased neuronal soma count, enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration (red arrow), and widened the gap between neuronal soma (yellow arrow) (Fig 6H). This status of immune imbalance in kmo-/- mice was also confirmed by complete blood count analysis, and the results indicated that the numbers of white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (Lym), monocyte (Mon), granulocyte (Gran) were significantly decreased in kmo-/- mice than those of kmo+/+ mice (Fig 6I).

We next performed RNA-seq analyses for the HSV-1-infected BMM cells from kmo+/+ and kmo-/- mice. Compared to the kmo-/- group, the kmo+/+ group significantly altered the expression of 2929 genes (975 upregulated and 1954 downregulated) (S9A Fig). Gene ontology (GO) analyses showed that the kmo+/+ group upregulated the expression of multiple genes related to IFN-β and IFN-γ production, immune system process, defense response (S9B Fig). KEGG analyses revealed enrichment in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway (S9C Fig). After hierarchical clustering, we identified 25 genes involved in the antiviral signaling pathway (S9D Fig). These data suggested that kmo knockout might reduce the antiviral function by regulating IFN-I production and related signaling pathways.

To further clarify whether QUIN has a rescue effect on virus-infected kmo-/- mice, kmo+/+ and kmo-/- mice were challenged with HSV-1 McKrae strain, followed by daily treatment with different concentrations of QUIN for 7 days (S10A Fig). QUIN administration effectively protected the mice and reduced disease scores in a dose-dependent manner (S10B and S10C Fig). The viral copies in the eye washing fluid from QUIN-treated (2.5 mg/kg) mice were significantly reduced than that of mock-treated mice. Of note, in the kmo+/+ group, the viral copies were significantly reduced in the QUIN-treated group at a lower dose of 1 mg/kg (S10D Fig). In addition, IFN-β secretion was significantly increased in the serum of QUIN-treated mice (S10E Fig).

Overall, these findings indicated that KMO is a key antiviral factor physiologically involved in modulating antiviral immunity.

Discussion

Independent of its known regulatory role on tryptophan metabolism, we herein reported that KMO and its enzymatic product QUIN exerted a novel broad-spectrum antiviral function against numerous emerging pathogenic viruses, thorough triggering the NMDAR/Ca2+ influx and CaMKII/ IRF3-mediated IFN-β production. Previously, KMO had been shown to associate with pathological conditions like tumorigenesis [41–43] and neurodegenerative diseases [44–48]. However, our study reported its new function in host immunity against viral infections. Importantly, in the animal infection model, QUIN treatment effectively inhibited viral infections and alleviated disease progression in vivo. Moreover, the kmo gene is a physiologically key antiviral factor because kmo-/- mice were more vulnerable to pathogenic viral challenge than kmo+/+ mice (Fig 7). As a result, our findings revealed the critical role of tryptophan metabolism in antiviral immunity, which highlighted the importance of further understanding the profound intricacy between innate immunity and cellular metabolism.

10.1371/journal.ppat.1010366.g007 Fig 7 A schematic illustrating KMO and its enzymatic product QUIN exerted a novel broadly antiviral function.

QUIN triggered the NMDAR/Ca2+ influx and CaMKII/IRF3-mediated IFN-β production.

The tryptophan metabolism, mainly processed by the kynurenine pathway (KP), is an essential physiological process to maintain our body’s health, and the key rate-limiting enzymes in the KP include IDO1, IDO2, TDO, and KMO [49]. Recently, KP has also been reported to play a critical role in modulating immune homeostasis [15], and the KP metabolites might be associated with immune disorders [50–52]. For example, IDO1 could inhibit the replication of human cytomegalovirus, HSV-1, and retroviruses through the increased consumption of L-Try [53–55]. However, the role of KMO in modulating innate immunity against viral infections has not been investigated. Our study examined the serum of kmo+/+ and kmo-/- mice. We found that kynurenine accumulated because of the absence of kmo (S11 Fig), which might have a negative feedback inhibition on IDO1. Still, our further research showed that the KMO and QUIN could independently inhibit the virus when IDO1 was inhibited. In addition, IDO-mediated tryptophan consumption was not involved in the IFN-α/β-mediated antiviral effects [40], but the antiviral effects of KMO and QUIN in our study were associated with IFN-β production. Therefore, the antiviral effects of KMO and IDO1 may have a synergistic relationship through different antiviral pathways.

Our study found that the clinical symptoms in pathogenic HSV-1 infected kmo-/- mice were more severe than those in kmo+/+ mice, and this observation was consistent with a lower IFN-γ secretion in kmo-/- mice than in kmo+/+ mice. One study showed that KMO deficiency increased the frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10 [56]. On the contrary, another study showed that KMO deficiency reduced the mortality in encephalomyocarditis virus-infected mice [57]. Therefore, KMO might play dual roles in regulating immune responses through various mechanisms, thus exerting beneficial and harmful effects on various diseases. Further studies are consequently needed to clarify how KMO precisely modulates inflammation, innate immunity, and adaptive immunity, especially in patients with autoimmune diseases and chronically infectious diseases.

Tryptophan metabolism through the KP is often preferentially directed to produce QUIN catalyzed by KMO [50]. Our studies indicated that the antiviral activity of KMO was mediated through its enzymatic product QUIN. We have provided evidence that QUIN activates the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and Ca2+ influx, which trigger the phosphorylation of CaMKII and IRF3, leading to IFN-I production. The previous study also found that Ca2+ and its major downstream effector, CaMKII, are important for immune cells’ functions, and CaMKII could significantly enhance the production of IFN-α/β in macrophages [37,58]. However, other studies demonstrated that NMDAR antagonists such as MK-801 inhibited Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-mediated neuropathogenesis and VSV infection [59,60]. Therefore, modulation of NMDAR in different cells or tissues might be a double-edged sword.

Of note, besides the enhanced IFN-β-mediated innate immunity, our data showed that QUIN treatment also promoted the IFN-γ-mediated cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) against HSV-1 antigen-specific stimulation. Stimulating antigen-specific CTL is essential for eradicating virus-infected host cells [61] and inhibiting the activation of viral latency [62], which is important for controlling chronically viral infections, such as HIV-1, HSV-1. Especially, IFN-γ could effectively suppress the reactivation from HSV-1 latency in sensory neurons [63,64]. Therefore, the enhancement of HSV-1-specific CTL responses by QUIN treatment contributed to suppressing herpes disease progression and providing long-term protection in our study.

The structural skeleton of QUIN and its derivatives were previously reported as an important pharmacophore and explored to develop anti-infectious agents, including anti-malaria [65,66], anti-tuberculosis [67], and anti-tumor [68]. Our studies showed that QUIN had broad antiviral activities against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses, including HSV-1, adenovirus, VSV, influenza virus (PR8), ZIKV, DENV, and SARS-CoV-2. We further demonstrated that administration of QUIN significantly inhibited viral infections and alleviated disease progression in the mouse model of pathogenic HSV-1 infection. To be noted, QUIN is a neuroactive metabolite and can induce oxidative neurotoxicity [69–71]. A high level of QUIN was reported to associate with Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, and Huntington’s disease [72]. Therefore, its potential neurotoxicity should be addressed when developing the QUIN as an antiviral drug candidate. Since QUIN cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier [73], and thus QUIN was injected intraperitoneally to exert antiviral effects in our in vivo experiment to avoid the potential side effect. Nevertheless, the safety of the long-term administration of QUIN should be further monitored in the future.

Some studies reported that the concentration of the QUIN was increased because of KP activation in response to some pathogen infections (such as HIV-1, HSV-1, influenza A virus) [74–80]. Importantly, recent studies also reported that KP metabolites, including kynurenate, kynurenine, 8-methoxykynurenate, were enriched in COVID-19 patients, and the decrease in tryptophan and the increase in kynurenine were correlated to the COVID-19 disease severity [81–83]. Given that we have encountered numerous challenges with emerging pathogenic viruses in the past decades years, including SARS, MARS, EBOLA, ZIKV, and SARS-COV-2, further studies on immune regulation of metabolic genes such as KMO may provide insights to develop novel broad antiviral agents like QUIN to treat diseases associated with many unpredictable, viral pathogens.

In summary, it is of great interest to further investigate the possibility of applying KMO and QUIN as antiviral drug candidates in future studies.

RNA-seq library preparation, sequencing, and data processing

RNA-seq experiments were performed as previously described [85]. In brief, RAW264.7 cells were incubated with or without QUIN at a dose of 1mM for 8 hours. Then the cells were infected with HSV-1 for another 8 hours. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from the kmo+/+ mice and kmo-/- mice were infected with HSV-1 for 8 hours. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, these samples were collected for total RNA extraction and then used to generate RNA-seq libraries with a TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v4-cBot-HS (Illumina, USA). The prepared libraries were sequenced on an Illumina platform by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). Genes with P values < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5 were differentially expressed. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed by using the GO knowledgebase (https://geneontology.org/), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was performed by using the KEGG database (hyyp://www.kegg.jp). The volcano plot was drawn by the Volcano mapping tool in SangerBox, and the GraphPad Prism software drew the heatmap.

Co-immunoprecipitation

The cells were harvested using NP40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Beyotime, China). After incubation on ice for 30min, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. Subsequently, a proportion of the cell lysate was performed for analysis as input, and another proportion was subjected to precipitation with appropriate antibodies overnight at 4°C. The next day, the beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) NP-40, 1 mM EDTA). The precipitated proteins were eluted from beads or gel by the heating sample in SDS loading buffer at 100°C for 10 min. The precipitates were subjected to Western Blotting Analysis.

Viral plaque assay

The Vero cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a density of 5 × 105 for 12 h, and the virus samples in 10-fold serial dilution were added. After 2 h of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2, the supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS. Then, each well added a medium containing 1% FBS, 1% low-melting-point agarose, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. After 5 days of incubation, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde for 1 h and stained with 2% crystal violet for another 1 h. Plaques were visualized and enumerated, and the virus titer was calculated as plaque-forming units per mL (PFU/mL).

Luciferase assay

The Steady-Glo Renilla Luciferase detection system and Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay were employed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

Ca2+ imaging

Calbryte 520 dye is a cell-permeable calcium indicator. Cells were loaded with this dye for 25 min in the dark at room temperature and washed 3 times with PBS. Next, cells were treated with appropriate stimulation. Calbryte 520 fluorescence imaging was recorded under a Leica microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).

Cell viability assay

1×104 cells were inoculated in each well of 96-well-plate, and a series of concentrations of QUIN were added. After incubating for the required time, 10 μl CCK8 solution was added into each well, followed by 1 h in the dark at 37°C. The OD at 450 nm was then detected by a microplate reader (Biotek, Synergy HTX, USA).

In vivo therapy experiment

C57BL/6 mice were bred in the SPF animal facility of the Laboratory Animal Resource Center of Sun Yat-sen University, and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards and Animal Care and Use Committees of Sun Yat-Sen University (Approval No. SYSU-IACUC-2021-000048). 6 to 8-week-old mice were anesthetized, and corneal epithelial debridement was performed using a 30-gauge needle, followed by the inoculation of 105 PFU HSV-1 (McKrae). Intraperitoneal injections of ACV (5 mg/kg), QUIN (2.5 mg/kg), or vehicle alone in 2% DMSO were administered daily for one week, and the ocular swabs, disease scores, and corneal images (Carl Zeiss stereoscope) were acquired during the experiment. The corneal surface was washed with PBS (20 μl/eye) at various times post-infection, and then the virus titer of these samples was quantified by plaque assay.

Challenge experiment in kmo-deficient mice

kmo-deficient C57BL/6 mice (kmo-/- mice) were constructed and identified as shown in S8 Fig and infected with 3×104 PFU HSV-1 (McKrae) by corneal inoculation as described above. The disease symptoms of experimental mice were monitored, and samples were collected as above to perform the corresponding detection.

QUIN rescue experiment

Both kmo+/+ and kmo-/- C57BL/6 mice were infected by HSV-1 (McKrae) as described above, and then intraperitoneal injections of QUIN (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5 mg/kg) were daily administered for one week. The disease symptoms of experimental mice were monitored, and samples were collected to perform the corresponding detection.

ELISA assay

The samples were collected and analyzed with the Mouse IFN Beta ELISA Kit (Solarbio Life Science, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

ELISPOT

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays were performed as previously described [86]. Briefly, 96-well plates (Millipore, Immobilon-P membrane) were coated with anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) overnight at 4°Cand then blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at 37°C. Freshly isolated splenocytes were added at 4 × 105 cells/well, and the HSV-1 peptides (Genscript, Nanjing, China, listed in S3 Table were immediately added at a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C, and the expression of IFN-γ was then detected using biotinylated polyclonal anti-mouse IFN-γ (BD Pharmingen) and NBT/BCIP reagent (Pierce). Finally, the numbers of spots were quantified using an ELISPOT reader (Bioreader4000, BIOSYS, Germany). The data was reported as spot-forming cells (SFC) per million cells.

Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS)

ICS was processed according to our previous method [87]. Briefly, 1×106 freshly isolated mouse splenocytes were stimulated with HSV-1 peptides (Genscript, Nanjing, China, listed in S3 Table at a final concentration of 2 mg/mL for 2 h at 37°C. The splenocytes were then incubated with brefeldin A (BD Pharmingen) for 16 h at 37°C. After incubation, the cells were collected and stained with anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD4-BB700, and anti-CD8-PE-Cy7 monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 1 h. Then the resuspended cells were permeabilized in FACS Perm/wash buffer for 20 min before staining with anti-IFN-γ-Alexa Fluor 647, anti-TNF-α-PE, and anti-IL-2-BV605 (BD Pharmingen). Samples were tested using the flow cytometer (CytoFLEX S, Beckman, America) instrument with CytExpert software (version 2.4).

The complete blood counts

Peripheral blood and plasma samples of experimental mice were collected following standard protocols, and the complete blood count was conducted with Mindray veterinary automatic blood cell analyzer BC-2800Vet.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining

The different tissues of experimental mice were immersed completely in 4% paraformaldehyde, gradually dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into sections. H&E staining was performed according to standard protocol by Wuhan Service Biotechnology CO., LTD.

LC-MS/MS analysis for Trp-Metabolites

The LC-MS/MS analysis of mouse serum (100 μl) was performed by Shanghai Applied Protein Technology, Shanghai, China.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance was calculated using Student’s two-tailed unpaired t-test or ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. *P < 0.05; **P< 0.01; ***P < 0.001.

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Part I - Summary

Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.

Reviewer #1: Exploring the novel antiviral agents is a public health priority against frequent outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. In this manuscript, Zhao and colleagues reported that KMO and its enzymatic product QUIN exerted a novel broad-spectrum antiviral function in vitro and in vivo via triggering NMDAR/Ca2+ influx and CaMKII/ IRF3-mediated IFN-� production. Previously, KMO was recognized as a key rate-limiting enzyme in the Tryptophan metabolism, but its role in the innate immunity in response to viral infections has not been clarified. Thus, this work addresses an important topic to help determine the possibility of applying KMO as a novel target of antiviral drugs. The authors' intriguing data is therefore of considerable interest. There are still some issues to be addressed by the authors that would improve the manuscript.

Reviewer #2: This study showed that the mid-stream enzyme from the kynurenine pathway of the tryptophan metabolism, KMO, plays a role in modulating anti-viral activity. They showed that KMO and quinolinic acid (QA) can exert antiviral activity involving NMDA-induced calcium flux and IRF-mediated IFN-beta activity. They further showed that KMO expression and QA were responsible for inhibiting a broad spectrum of viruses that may confer a protective and susceptibility role in the host against viral infection.

A major strength of the study is that the authors used various approaches to examine the role of KMO and QA as novel antiviral targets. For this, I appreciate and acknowledge the efforts of this study. Another interesting result from this study that was understated in this study is the result of KMO and QA having a direct impact on the immune activity in driving antiviral activity.

A major concern I have is to what extent does IDO-1 involved in this study co-commitment with KMO activity? This is something that needs to be teased out since IDO-1 also has antiviral activity. For example, O Adams et al (J Virol, 2004 - https://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.78.5.2632-2636.2004) showed that IDO-1 can exert antiviral effect via interferon activity. We know that viral infection can trigger IDO-1, which is likely to be the case in this study. Did the authors look at IDO-1 expression to make sure their result is due to KMO and not IDO-1? It is also possible that inhibition of KMO leads to accumulation of kynurenine which can have a negative feedback inhibition on IDO-1, thereby suppressing antiviral activity as well. Hence this is important missing info to look into.

In short, if the authors can prove that the antiviral effect is due to KMO and not IDO. This will be a novel role in the field of tryptophan research.

Reviewer #3: This study examined the mechanism of action of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO)-mediated antiviral effect. It was shown that the enzymatic product of KMO, quinolinic acid (QUIN), activates N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and Ca2+ influx, which subsequently activates Calcium/calmodulin29 dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) / Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Over-expression of KMO led to the inhibition of viral replication, while knockout or mutate KMO promote viral replication. Similarly, QUIN treatment led to the inhibition of viral replication of multiple viruses in cell culture. QUIN was also shown to have in vivo antiviral efficacy in HSV-1 infection mouse model.

**********

Part II – Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance

Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be absolutely required to validate study conclusions.

Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".

Reviewer #1: 1. The author analyzed the difference in transcriptomics of cell lines after virus infections with or without QUIN incubation and found the changes in the interferon pathway. It is recommended to analyze further the difference in transcriptomics of primary cells between KMO-/- mice and wild KMO+/+ mice after viral infections.

2. Does QUIN have rescue effects on KMO-/- cell lines or KMO-/- mice infected with the virus?

3. Fig S5 provided some vital information regarding the immune dysfunction status in kmo-/- mice compared to wild mice, and thus this figure should be moved to the Text.

4. Line 269-271 and Line 285-288: repeated descriptions

5. Line 288-290: The cited literature seems not related to the topic what authors meant

6. phrases such as in vitro, in vivo, and KMO (or kmo) is sometimes in italics and sometimes not in italics

Reviewer #2: 1) Demonstrate that all antiviral activities is independent of IDO-1 expression.

2) If IDO-1 expression confound with the finding, does pharmacological inhibition of IDO-1 (e.g. 1-MT) still confer antiviral activity by KMO?

Reviewer #3: 1. The antiviral effect shown in Fig. 4 is very moderate, and in most case less than 1 log viral reduction was observed. It is also not shown whether the antiviral effect is cell type dependent. For example, does QUIN inhibit influenza virus replication in epithelial cells?

2. NMDA receptor is found in neurons. However, not all the viruses studied in this ms including HSV-1, VSV, PR8, ZIKA, Dengue, and SARS-CoV-2 are neurotropic viruses. Therefore there is a lack of physiological relevance for the use of NMDA activator as antivirals. Are the cell lines used for the antiviral assay all express NMDAR? If yes, what are the evidences?

3. The claim of repurposing quinolinic acid as a broad-spectrum antiviral is misleading. Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is a neuroactive metabolite, and can induce oxidative neurotoxicity. High quinolinic acid levels have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, and Huntington's disease. Therefore, a section should be added to state the well-known side effects of quinolinic acid so the readers are not biased.

Ref:Davis I & Liu A (2015) What is the tryptophan kynurenine pathway and why is it important to neurotherapeutics? Expert Rev Neurother 15, 719–721.

4. In the in vivo study, QUIN is dosed by IP injection, and it has been shown that QUIN could not pass the BBB, therefore, how could it elicit the antiviral effect? A relatively low dose of 2.5mg/kg of QUIN was used, is this sufficient to achieve the in vivo drug concentration that is needed to suppress viral infection?

5. NMDAR antagonists such as MK-801 have been shown to inhibit Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-mediated neuropathogenesis (ref below). In addition, NMDAR antagonists were also reported as VSV and influenza antivirals. Therefore, modulation of NMDAR might be a double-edge sword.

**********

Part III – Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications

Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.

Reviewer #1: The language needs professional editing, here are a few examples.

Line 21: replace "through kynurenine pathway" with "through the kynurenine pathway"

Line 43: replace "mechanism" with "mechanisms"

Line 44: replace "in vivo" with italics "in vivo"

Line 83:replace "infection" with "infections"

Line 118: replace "overexpression" with "the overexpression"

Line 271: remove the space after "kmo+/+ mice"

Line 202, 204, 225, 319: replace "viral infection" with "viral infections"

Reviewer #2: The overall narrative of the introduction and discussion that links KMO to cancer and neurodegeneration seems slightly out of context with what the study is trying to demonstrate. Hence, the direct focus of the role of KP in immunology and virology should be discussed more thoroughly. Some earlier work on KP (especially IDO-1) and antiviral is missing such as O Adams et al (as mentioned above), Gaeling L et al (2016) - https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.13966, Fernandez-Pol (2001) - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11911246/. The authors may also want to consider linking some of the KP discoveries performed in COVID-19. See this paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2020.10.003.

Another question that is worth discussing in the paper is that if the host uses KMO-mediated QA to suppress viral activity, is there a long-term consequence where increased QA production chronically can promotes neurodegeneration?
