Background
Patients' participation in medical decision making is an important aspect of patient‐centred care. However, there is often uncertainty about its applicability and feasibility in non‐Western countries.

Objective
To provide an overview and assessment of interventions that aimed to improve patients' participation in decision making in non‐Western countries.

Method
Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process, Other Non‐Indexed Citations, without Revisions and Daily Update and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, were searched from respective inception to February 2018. Studies were included if they (a) were randomized controlled trials, before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series studies; (b) were conducted in non‐Western countries; (c) aimed to improve patients' participation in dyadic decision making; and (d) reported outcomes relevant to patient participation in decision making. Studies were excluded if they included children, were about triadic decision making or solely focused on information provision without reporting outcomes related to patient participation. Narrative synthesis method was used for data analysis and presentation.

Results
A total of 17 studies, 6 RCTs and 11 non‐RCTs, were included across ten countries. Intervention strategies included patient and/or provider communication skills training, decision aids and a question prompt material. Whilst most of the studies reported increased patient participation, those interventions which had provider or patient training in communication skills were found to be more effective.

Conclusion
Interventions to improve patient participation, within the context of dyadic decision making, in non‐Western countries can be feasible and effective if communication skills training is provided for health‐care providers and/or patients.

==== Body
1 INTRODUCTION
Participation in decision making is a process where engaged patients and health‐care providers partake in shared decision making through the meaningful exchange of information and experiences.1 It is a key characteristic of patient‐centred health care, a paradigm that has become popular in recent decades, replacing more paternalistic health‐care models. Recent evidence shows that greater participation in health‐care decisions increases patients' satisfaction, improves patient‐provider relationships, facilitates medication adherence and decreases health‐care costs.2, 3 There is also emerging evidence that participation in decisions may reduce health inequalities experienced by vulnerable groups such as racial and ethnic minorities, low literacy groups and seniors.4 However, issues such as time constraints, patient characteristics, low health literacy and cultural factors are often reported as barriers to participative decision making, with some saying that it is impractical amongst certain groups.5, 6, 7


Globally, this paradigm shift was reflected in the pronouncement of the Alma‐Ata Declaration in 1979, a landmark moment calling for greater participation from individuals and communities in their health‐care planning and implementation.8, 9 More recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the Framework on Integrated People‐Centred Health Services (IPCHS), promoting Universal Health Coverage through equal, responsive, affordable and quality health‐care services.10 An important strategy proposed by this Framework is to engage and empower individuals and families.11 A number of strategies, including shared clinical decision making, were proposed. However, the report fell short of providing recommended strategies, concept analyses and best practices.

In many Western countries, policies have been developed to support patients' participation in health‐care decision making and the use of decision aids, question prompt lists and training for both clinicians and patients.12, 13, 55 For example, in Australia, the statement ‘I have a right to be included in decisions and choices about my care’ is part of the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights.14 However, less is known about how to effectively involve patients in health‐care decisions in non‐Western countries. In these settings, some have argued that the concepts of ‘patient centeredness’ and ‘active participation’ are based on the Western ideology of individual autonomy and are therefore less applicable.16, 17 In cultures where individuals see themselves as agents of a family, community or a tribe, within a hierarchical community, health‐care professionals are often to be respected.18, 19, 20 Questioning by patients is to be avoided to bring harmony during encounters.18, 19, 20 Other factors that may be prevalent in some non‐Western countries are high patient loads, lack of skills in participatory communication amongst health providers, a lack of relevant research evidence and low health literacy amongst patients.20, 21, 22 These lead to the question of whether patient‐centred care, and more specifically, patients' participation in health decisions, is a feasible and appropriate strategy in non‐Western country contexts. This systematic review aims to identify interventions designed to improve adult patients' participation in health‐care decisions in non‐Western countries, assess their feasibility and synthesize factors that influence their effectiveness.

2 METHODS
This systematic review is reported in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) (Appendix S1).23


2.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The PICOS (participants, intervention, comparator, outcome and study design) 23 approach was used to define the following eligibility criteria for study selection.

2.1.1 Participants
Studies were included if participants lived in non‐Western countries (defined as countries that are not members of UN classification of Western European and Other States Group (WEOG)).24 The same classification method was used in a previous systematic review 25 We excluded studies that included children (aged <18).

2.1.2 Interventions
We included studies which aimed to improve the participation of patients in the process of decision making. Studies were excluded if interventions: (a) only focused on information provision; (b) were about promoting self‐management of conditions; (c) were about patient participation in triadic decision making; and (d) aimed at promoting participation in clinical trials, patient safety measures or planning and development of health‐care programmes.

2.1.3 Outcomes
Outcomes related to patient activation, patient or provider participatory behaviours during the decision‐making encounters were analysed. Patient activation is a broad concept with a definition of ‘an individual's knowledge, skill, and confidence for managing their health and health care’.26 In this systematic review, we only included studies which reported patient activation outcomes in relation to individuals’ skills and confidence in participating in health‐care decision making.

2.1.4 Study designs
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled or uncontrolled before‐and‐after studies with pre‐ and post‐test data available and interrupted time series studies were included.

2.2 Search strategy and study selection
We systematically searched databases using keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) related to pre‐specified PICOS criteria. Some segments of our search strategy were adapted from other published systematic reviews with similar concepts.4, 27 The search strategy was originally developed in Medline via OvidSP (Appendix S2) and later modified to other databases. We initially limited our search to humans, adults and the English language, and later expanded the search to the non‐English language records. Returned records from database searches were combined, duplicates removed using Endnote X8 software, and remaining references imported to the Covidence tool28 for screening, data extraction and quality assessment purposes. Two reviewers conducted title and abstract screening and full‐text screening of eligible studies on Covidence. Disagreement on the selection of certain studies was resolved by consensus.

2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment
We extracted data using the Covidence online tool28 and an adaptation of the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group data extraction template.29 We recorded country of origin, study design, participant numbers, intervention characteristics, theoretical framework, setting/conditions, outcome measures and detailed outcome results.

The quality of RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias).30 The quality of non‐randomized studies was assessed using the modified Downs and Black's checklist,31 rating each study numerically against 27‐item questions, and the total score ranged from 0 to 28.

2.4 Data analysis
Due to the wide variation of study designs, intervention strategies and outcome measures used in the included studies, a narrative synthesis method was used. Narrative synthesis is a process of exploring study characteristics and their relationships within (and between) included studies in order to identify factors influencing the effectiveness and implementation of interventions.32 The process of narrative synthesis was partially guided by recommendations by Popay et al.32 We used textual description, grouping and tabulation methods for preliminary synthesis and exploration of patterns across studies.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Characteristics of included studies
A total of 7992 studies were identified through the initial search of publications in the English language. Two additional studies were added by recalling previously known studies and further three from citation searching. The search for non‐English language papers within the same databases identified 476 studies; however, none of these were eligible for inclusion. Seventeen studies (6 RCTs and 11 non‐RCTs) were included in the final stage of data extraction and quality assessment (Figure 1). The included studies were conducted in 10 countries, including Hong Kong and mainland China (n = 3), Japan (n = 3), South Korea (n = 2), Mexico (n = 2), Nicaragua (n = 1), Iran (n = 1), Indonesia (n = 2), Namibia (n = 1), Trinidad and Tobago (n = 1) and Honduras (n = 1). There were a variety of clinical conditions featured in these studies, including family planning (n = 5), general consultations (n = 3), breast cancer treatment (n = 2), dental consultations, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG), birth choice, mental health, HIV antiretroviral treatment and advanced care (see Table 1 and Table 2).

John Wiley & Sons, LtdThe methodological quality of the included RCTs varied across studies (Figure 2). Two (2/6) did not provide sufficient information on random sequence generation methods, and three (3/6) studies did not describe or have allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and personnel was lacking in two (2/6) studies, and in one study, outcome assessment was not reported in detail to permit a judgement. The Downs and Black quality scores for non‐randomized studies ranged from 12 to 21 (see Table 2).

3.2 Data synthesis
There were four types of intervention strategies in the included studies; provider communication skills training (n = 4), patient communication skills training (n = 3), question prompt material (n = 1) and patient decision aids (n = 9). Details of elements of each intervention strategies, theoretical background and development processes are summarized in Table 1. Based on our pre‐defined outcome inclusion criteria and emergent patterns in the extracted data, we categorized study outcomes into three groups: (a) change in decisional conflict or preparedness; (b) patient participatory behaviours; and (c) provider participatory behaviours (see Table 2).

3.2.1 Provider communication skills training
Four studies used the conceptual framework of Interpersonal Communication and Counselling (IPC/C) 33, 34, 35 or client‐centred counselling36 for provider communication skills training, and all four were controlled before‐and‐after studies. Two studies33, 34 measured the effects of stand‐alone provider interpersonal communication skills training, whilst the other two35, 36 assessed the impact of self‐assessment, peer review and supervision on the maintenance of provider communication skills. They all used interaction analysis of audiotaped clinical encounters using the Roter interaction analysis system (RIAS). All four studies reported significant improvements in trained doctors’ facilitative talking behaviours, such as using open‐ended questions,33 facilitators (checking for understanding and asking for opinions),33, 34, 35 emotional talk33, 34 and partnership building35, 36 when compared with doctors in the control groups. Improvements in patient active communication, such as asking questions36 and providing medical information,33, 34 were also reported.

3.2.2 Patient communication skills training
Three studies provided communication training for patients. One RCT from Namibia used a curriculum with three components: learning to speak to providers, using tools to help communication and overcoming barriers to communication.37 The second cluster‐randomized study from Indonesia provided individual coaching to patients on asking questions, requesting clarification and expressing concerns prior to their consultations.38 Finally, a controlled before‐and‐after study from South Korea developed a shared decision‐making training programme for people with schizophrenia.39


The Namibian training programme for patients resulted in the doctors of trained participants performing significantly better in facilitating (adjusted difference in score 1.19, P = 0.004) and gathering information (adjusted difference in scores 2.96, P = 0.000) than control group doctors. These trained patients also asked significantly more questions during consultations (adjusted difference in score 0.48, P = 0.012).37 The Indonesian study of individual coaching for patients also resulted in the coached patients asking significantly more questions than those in the control group (6.3 vs 4.9, P < 0.01).38 Similarly, the shared decision‐making training in South Korea found a significant positive change in self‐esteem in the intervention group compared to control (mean change ± SD: 4.06 ± 4.42 vs −1.06 ± 3.66, P < 0.001) which could be seen as empowerment in decision making.39


3.2.3 Decision aids
Patient decision aids (PDAs) were utilized in nine of the 17 included studies and the PDAs were either paper‐based40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 or computer‐delivered.47, 48 Five of these studies (5/9), all from East Asian countries, used the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration checklist to guide the development of their decision aids.42, 43, 45, 46, 48 Of the nine included studies of PDAs, three were RCTs.42, 43, 48 We note that none of the RCTs42, 43, 48 included training as part of their intervention and that the studies which did were all of a weaker study design as uncontrolled before‐and‐after studies (n = 6).40, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47 Nevertheless, amongst these nine studies evaluating patient decision aids, there was a consistent improvement in the patient and provider participatory behaviours in those studies which included provider and/or patient training as part of the intervention.40, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47


The Hong Kong RCT found that the decision aid tool significantly reduced decisional conflict compared with a standard information booklet at one‐week post‐intervention (mean = 15.8, SD = 15.5 vs mean = 19.9, SD = 16.3, P = 0.016). However, there was no difference in providers' participatory behaviours, as analysed on consultation videotapes (mean = 33.01, SD = 9.71 vs mean = 32.06, SD = 0.45). The RCT from Japan found that decisional conflict was significantly reduced for both the decision aid groups one month after receiving them and after having the selected surgery (26.5 vs 26.9 vs 32.1), but not immediately after the intervention and before the surgery (28.7 vs 29.8 vs 31.7).43 Conversely, the RCT study from South Korea 48 which assessed a PDA for carpal tunnel syndrome did not find any difference in the decisional conflict between the PDA (video format) group and the regular information group (control) (22 vs 23, P = 0.76).

Amongst the remaining six uncontrolled before‐and‐after studies, three studies using the WHO family planning decision‐making tool (DMT) reported positive changes in provider and client participatory behaviours (see Table 2).40, 41, 44 The other two studies from China (PDA in POAG) and Japan (PDA in birth choices) reported a reduction in decisional conflict after patients were given PDAs with a short briefing45 and decisional support.46 The study from mainland China, using a 3D multimedia system able to display relevant dental anatomy as an aid for patient‐provider communication, reported that patients felt more involved in decision making, understood decisions and treatment planning.47


3.2.4 Question prompt materials
One study (an RCT) in Japan compared the use of a Question Prompt Sheet (QPS) and standard Hospital Introduction Sheet (HIS) for advanced cancer patients.49 Participants who received the QPS were more likely to find the materials useful in helping them asking questions compared to the HIS group (4.4 ± 3.6 vs 2.7 ± 2.8, P = 0.003); however, there were no differences in asking questions (63% vs 71%) nor total questions asked (both median 1) between these two groups.49


4 DISCUSSION
This systematic review used a narrative synthesis method to summarize the effects of interventions for improving patient participation in health‐care decisions within non‐Western countries. Seventeen studies from 10 countries were included, covering a variety of health topics. These studies evaluated four main strategies, including patient or/and provider communication skills training, PDAs and question prompt material. We summarized the impact of these studies on three outcomes, namely patient decisional conflict, patient participatory behaviours and provider participatory behaviours.

Our findings show an evolution of patient participation research in non‐Western countries over the past two decades which parallels, but is less developed than in Western countries. For example, the earliest studies (Trinidad and Tobago 199833; Honduras 200034; Indonesia 200036; Mexico 200235) focused on training for health‐care providers in communication and counselling skills. These were funded by USAID, and two of these 33, 34 were part of a Quality Assurance Project replicating research from high‐income countries.50 Stand‐alone provider training based on IPC was found to be effective when characterized by two‐way communication, partnership, a caring environment and bridging the social distance.33, 34, 50 These findings were further validated by Kim and her colleagues, who incorporated ongoing supervision and self‐assessment of provider communication skills with the Interpersonal Communication and Counselling (IPC/C) training in Indonesia and Mexico and achieved long‐term maintenance of provider communication skills.35, 36 They suggested that incorporating specific supervision on provider IPC/C skills to the already existing functional provider performance supervision system could be a cost‐effective option in developing countries.35, 36


Communication skills training was evaluated amongst Indonesian patients of providers who had previously received client‐centred counselling skills training.36, 38 Patients received individual coaching which increased their participatory communication behaviours and confirmed the importance of explicit permission or endorsement from providers for patients to speak up and ask questions.38 This supports the notion that patient coaching could complement provider communication skills training in strengthening the partnership relationship during medical consultations.

A patient decision aid, the WHO family planning Decision‐Making Tool (DMT), began to be evaluated next in Mexico (2005),40 Nicaragua (2007)41 and Iran (2014).44 The DMT tool was developed by WHO in 2001 to promote client‐centred counselling and client active participation in decision making.51, 52 It has been translated into 20 languages and utilized by nearly 50 countries.51 These evaluative studies were developed as part of the USAID Information and Knowledge for Optimal Health (INFO) project, which had a mission of disseminating best practices in reproductive health care by facilitating knowledge sharing.53 The studies in Nicaragua 41 and Mexico40 showed that the use of the tool during family planning consultations improved provider participatory behaviours as well as patient participation in decision making.40, 41, 44, 51 Like the Indonesian study of patient coaching, these decision aid interventions included provider training on how to effectively use the tool and some briefings on counselling skills. The use of this tool was initiated by the health‐care providers during client encounters, which may have created an environment where clients felt safe and encouraged to play an active role. The more recent study from Iran also reinforced the positive effects of the DMT and provider training on patient participation in decision making.44


Our results highlight that the early studies in our review were international aid‐funded in low‐ and middle‐income settings, testing the transfer of Western country‐developed concepts such as patient‐centred counselling and shared decision making. The key effective components were as follows: (a) provider communication skills training in patient‐centred counselling; (b) ongoing supervision, peer review and self‐assessment of provider participatory communication and counselling skills; (c) targeted and tailored patient communication skills coaching or training; and (d) provision of a decision aid, to be used during the consultation by the provider.

By contrast, more recent studies included in this review (n = 9) were from high‐ and upper‐middle‐income East Asian countries (Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and mainland China).37, 42, 43, 45, 46, 48, 54 Decision aids which met the IPDAS criteria were predominately tested in the studies from East Asia (5/8), especially since 2013.42, 43, 45, 46, 48 These studies mainly assessed the effect on decisional conflict; the three RCT studies42, 43, 48 within this group showed mixed and inconsistent results. However, as noted earlier, the non‐RCT PDA studies from East Asia which had provider47 or patient communication training39, 45, 46 components resulted in significant improvements to patient participation.

It is worth noting that a recent Special Issue on Shared Decision Making (SDM) published in conjunction with the International Shared Decision‐Making Conference in Lyon 2017 reported on the status of SDM implementation in over 20 countries.55 By contrast to the previous special issue in 2011,56 this issue included articles from several non‐Western countries and regions (Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Iran, Malaysia, Peru and Taiwan).55 Most of these countries reported a growing interest in patient participation but faced challenges in implementation. Therefore, at this time, there is a unique opportunity to expand and implement the evidence we have highlighted in this review. Ironically, the earliest work in non‐Western low‐income countries which showed considerable efficacy has not progressed and should be urgently revisited.

Our review was not able to explore specific cultural aspects of patient participation, but it did highlight the potential for this to be successfully achieved, particularly if provider training is incorporated. Learnings from the studies that used IPC should be particularly noted, due to the unique way that they emphasized reducing social distance, an aspect of culture not strongly featured in Western countries. Social distance can be a ‘virtual barrier’ between providers and patients created by the subjective feelings of alienation in class and status due to age, sex, race and social, educational, economic and cultural backgrounds.50 Therefore, such cultural and local aspects of patient‐provider communication in non‐Western should not be overlooked when designing interventions to promote patient active participation.

One of the limitations of this systematic review is that we focused our systematic review on participation in dyadic decision making amongst patients living in non‐Western countries. We acknowledge that family and significant others can play a significant role in the process of decision making in some patients from non‐Western cultural backgrounds.57 However, one recent study58 has suggested this may be less homogenous within cultures than previously thought. Another limitation is that we only included studies that were published in English and were identified from major databases in medical research. To draw more complete conclusions on the evidence from non‐Western countries, a comprehensive search of the literature in non‐Western country‐specific databases that collect local language studies might be needed in the future.

In conclusion, people in non‐Western countries can successfully be involved in their health‐care decisions, and this should not be overlooked as this is a core component of a people‐centred health‐care system as advocated by the Alma‐Ata Declaration and the WHO framework for IPCHS. Our study highlights the ability of communication skills training for patients and providers to increase patient participation and involvement in health‐care decisions. Such intervention strategies should be further developed and implemented as a priority in non‐Western countries regardless of their income status.
