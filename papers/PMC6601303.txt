Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, painless and
easy-to use-technology. It can be used in depression, schizophrenia and other
neurological disorders. There are no studies about longer usage protocols
regarding the ideal duration and weekly frequency of tDCS.

Objective:
to study the use of tDCS twice a week for longer periods to improve memory in
elderly with MCI.

Methods:
a randomized double-blind controlled trial of anodal tDCS on cognition of 58
elderly aged over 60 years was conducted. A current of 2.0 mA was applied
for 30 minutes for 10 sessions, twice a week. The anode was placed over the
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLFC). Subjects were evaluated before
and after 10 sessions by the following tests: CAMCOG, Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE), Trail Making, Semantic Verbal Fluency (Animals), Boston
naming, Clock Drawing Test, Word list memory (WLMT), Direct and Indirect
Digit Order (WAIS-III and WMS-III) and N-back.

Results:
After 10 sessions of tDCS, significant group-time interactions were found for
the CAMCOG - executive functioning (χ2 = 3.961, p = 0.047),
CAMCOG - verbal fluency (χ2 = 3.869, p = 0.049), CAMCOG - Memory
recall (χ2 = 9.749, p = 0.004), and WMLT - recall (χ2
= 7.254, p = 0.007). A decline in performance on the CAMCOG - constructional
praxis (χ2 = 4.371, p = 0.037) was found in the tDCS group after
intervention. No significant differences were observed between the tDCS and
Sham groups for any other tasks.

Conclusion:
tDCS at 2 mA for 30 min twice a week over 5 consecutive weeks proved superior
to placebo (Sham) for improving memory recall, verbal fluency and executive
functioning in elderly with MCI.

RESUMO.
A ETCC (estimulação transcraniana por corrente contínua) é uma tecnologia
não-invasiva, indolor e de fácil utilização. Pode ser usada na depressão,
esquizofrenia e outros distúrbios neurológicos. Não há orientações ideais sobre
o uso de protocolos mais longos quanto à duração e frequência semanal da
ETCC.

Objetivo:
estudar o uso de ETCC duas vezes por semana por 5 semanas em idosos com
CCL.

Métodos:
o estudo foi controlado, randomizado, duplo-cego com ETCC anódica em 58
idosos acima de 60 anos. Uma corrente de 2,0 mA foi aplicada por 30 minutos
durante 10 sessões consecutivas, 2 vezes por semana. O ânodo foi colocado no
córtex pré-frontal dorsolateral esquerdo (LDLFC). Os pacientes foram
avaliados antes e após 10 sessões pelos testes: CAMCOG, Mini-Exame do Estado
Mental (MMSE), Trilhas, Fluência Verbal Semântica - Animais, Boston,
Relógio, Memória da Lista de Palavras (WLMT), Dígitos - ordem direta e
indireta (WAIS-III e WMS-III) e N-back.

Resultados:
foram encontradas interações significativas (tempo/grupo) para CAMCOG -
funcionamento executivo (χ2 = 3,961, p = 0,047), CAMCOG -
fluência verbal (χ2 = 3,869, p = 0,049), CAMCOG - recuperação da
memória (χ2 = 9.749, p = 0,004), WMLT - recordação (χ2
= 7,254, p = 0,007). Foi observado um declínio no grupo ETCC após a
intervenção para CAMCOG - praxia construtiva (χ2 = 4,371, p =
0,037). Não encontramos diferenças significativas entre os grupos ETCC e
placebo para outros testes.

Conclusão:
A ETCC de 2 mA por 30 min, 2x por semana, por 5 semanas consecutivas, é
superior ao placebo (Sham) na melhoria da recuperação de memória, fluência
verbal e funcionamento executivo em idosos com CCL.

==== Body
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is associated with cognitive improvements
in healthy individuals,1
,
2 modulating cortical excitability through
synaptic long-term potentiation/depression rate.3
The most important objective of tDCS is to modulate neuronal activity of some specific
brain areas in a polarity-dependent pathway.4
During stimulation, current flows into the brain between the electrodes, modulating the
brain such that the region beneath the anode undergoes depolarization resulting in
excitation, while the area beneath the cathode undergoes hyperpolarization and
inhibition.5 Although many authors have
studied the effects of tDCS for mental disorders,6
there is no clear consensus on applying this technique in dementia-related
disorders.7 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
may represent a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s dementia.8 Many studies have suggested a progression rate of MCI to dementia
averaging around 10% to 15% per year, particularly in amnestic MCI, where executive
cognition disabilities are prevalent.9


In the complex physiopathology of MCI, many authors describe a dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC) dysfunction. They suggest that there is altered DLPFC functional
connectivity with various cortical and subcortical regions during the resting
state.10 DLPFC function is very important for
maintaining executive memory cognition and working memory. DLPFC dysfunction affects
incoming sensory information, language comprehension, reasoning and learning.
Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have shown altered DLPFC functioning as one
of the possible neural bases responsible for the cognitive deficits, such as poor
episodic memory retrieval and executive function, noted in MCI patients.11 Anode placement over the left DLPFC and cathode
over the right supraorbital region is the most common tDCS protocol for improving
working memory.

There is a lack of effective treatments to prevent progression to dementia. Only a few
studies have examined the efficacy of neuromodulation strategies for treatment of
deficits associated to MCI or dementia. A single session of 1mA anodal tDCS improved
word-retrieval of a group of 18 MCI patients in a study with a crossover design.12 Moreover, four sessions of 2mA anodal tDCS were
also associated with cognitive improvement in mild vascular dementia.13 However, there are no studies about the effects
of a longer protocol which might be suitable for current clinical practice, in terms of
duration and weekly frequency.

METHODS
Participants

Figure 1 shows the general study design.
Sixty individuals aged over 60 years with MCI were recruited, of which 58 (20
males and 38 females) completed the study. Participants were assigned in order
of spontaneous arrival at a medical clinic by a geriatric specialist, until a
total of 60 participants was reached. The participants were then randomized into
an active or sham group. The trial started after 60 individuals had been
recruited, in order to achieve a 95% confidence interval with 12.75% confidence
interval. Clinical diagnosis was based on the Mayo Clinic Criteria.14 Two individuals, one from each group,
dropped out due to medical conditions unrelated to the study. Patients with
unstable medical conditions, dementia and axis I psychiatric disorders, as well
as subjects on psychotropic or anticholinergic drugs, were not included in the
study.

Ethics
The present study was approved by the UNIFESP ethics committee under number CAAE:
54213115.7.0000.5505. The study was not registered on clinical trials.

Materials
Stimulation was delivered by a specialized device (brand Ibramed, model STRIAT
GMES) with 25cm2 square rubber electrodes
in a saline-soaked sponge. TDCS stimulation was administered by a trained
biomedic, with no contact with the other evaluators. The instruments below were
used for neuropsychological assessment. The Cambridge Cognitive Examination
(CAMCOG) is a battery of psychological tests for cognitive assessment, comprised
of several subscales to evaluate the following domains: orientation, language,
memory, attention, praxis, perception, calculation and abstract thinking.15 The Mini-Mental State Examination test
(MMSE) is a cognitive screening instrument assessing six dimensions:
orientation, memory, attention, calculus, language and praxis.16 The Trail Making Test, comprising two
versions, is a test which evaluates visual attention and task switching.17 The Semantic Verbal Fluency test (Animal
word version) (SVF) evaluates verbal fluency by asking the individual to name as
many different animals they can in one minute.18 The Boston naming test assesses verbal memory by presenting
pictures of everyday objects and asking the subject to name them.19 The Clock Drawing Test entails a task
where the individual is asked to draw a clock, used to assess visuospatial and
praxis abilities.20 The Word List Memory
Test (WLMT) comprises three phases, in which the individual is presented 10
words and has to recall them after 90 seconds and after 15 minutes from among 10
other distractors.21 The Digital
Symbol-Coding test is a subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale which
assesses processing speed, associative memory and graphomotor speed. The Forward
and Backward Digit Span test is a subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale which
assesses verbal working memory and attention.22 The N-back test comprises a computer-test in which the individual
is presented a sequence of stimuli, displayed one by one, and performs the task
of matching the current stimulus with another presented n steps earlier in the
sequence. We also applied the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). These
neuropsychological tests were administered by a blinded trained
neuropsychologist who had no contact with the other evaluators.

Procedures
We report the results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial of anodal
tDCS assessing cognition. A current of 2.0 mA was applied for 30 minutes for 10
sessions, twice a week. The anode was placed over the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (LDLFC) and the cathode in the right supraorbital area. Sham
stimulation involved the same set-up, but the current was turned off after a
30-second ramp. Figure 1 depicts the
patient allocation and procedure protocol.

Statistical analysis
Group comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney test and Pearson’s Chi
square test. Differences between groups involving neuropsychological measures at
baseline and after intervention were assessed with generalized estimating
equations (GEE) (Gamma distribution and first-order autoregressive correlation
matrix). Post-hoc pairwise comparison was corrected for multiple comparisons
using least significant difference.

RESULTS
Groups were matched for age (u(56) = 455; p = 0.591), gender (χ2(1) =
0.605; p = 0.581) and education level (χ2(2) = 4.971; p = 0.083). No
significant differences were found in blood pressure, laboratory blood measures,
cranial MRI aspects or HAM-D scores. Table 1
shows the clinical characteristics of the tDCS and Sham groups. Table 2 shows comparisons involving
neuropsychological parameters between baseline and after 10 sessions of tDCS/Sham
stimulation. After 10 sessions of tDCS, significant group-time interactions for the
CAMCOG - executive functioning (χ2 = 3.961, p = 0.047), CAMCOG - verbal
fluency (χ2 = 3.869, p = 0.049), CAMCOG Memory - recall (χ2 =
9.749, p = 0.004), and WMLT - recall (χ2 = 7.254, p = 0.007) were
evident. A decline in performance for the CAMCOG - constructional praxis
(χ2 = 4.371, p = 0.037) was found in the tDCS group after
intervention. No significant effects involving the interaction between time and
group were found for any other tasks. Figure 2
shows effects on neuropsychological parameters after tDCS × Sham interventions

DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that tDCS can improve some aspects of memory impairment in
elderly with MCI. We found significant changes in memory recall and long-term memory
after administration of 10 sessions of tDCS twice a week.

Some authors have demonstrated advantages with the use of tDCS in treatment of mental
disorders, particularly depression and cognitive impairment.23
,
24 Although most studies demonstrate that
tDCS is a safe and effective method in depression and possibly Alzheimer
disease,25 there are important issues to
be considered. First, there is a lack of studies on tDCS efficacy for Mild Cognitive
Impairment in the elderly. There are also doubts about the best techniques relating
to the intensity of current, stimulation time, electrode placement and number and
frequency of sessions. When studying actual results, we note variability of findings
and conclusions, suggesting that numerous different factors may affect the results.
Besides the variability of protocols, there is evidence in literature that genetic
factors, such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) polymorphism, may
influence the improvement in cognition after brain stimulation.26 We believe that a better understanding of neuroplasticity
genes will be important to predict outcomes in tDCS.

Another important practical consideration is that trials usually involve daily
sessions, which span a period of 4 weeks. This protocol is not affordable for most
patients. In this sense, our premise in testing the efficacy of 30 min sessions,
twice a week over 5 weeks was precisely to verify whether a more economical paradigm
could also lead to positive results. Our results suggest that, using a current of 2
mA for 30 min twice a week over 5 consecutive weeks, tDCS is superior to placebo
(Sham) for improvement of memory recall, verbal fluency and executive functioning in
elderly with MCI. This study has some limitations: it was not possible to calculate
the sample size because this was a pilot study. Nevertheless, the confidence
interval was calculated for a sample of 60 individuals considering a 95%
significance level and population of 209.3 million population. Although Fisher’s LSD
was used, the statistical analysis did not employ more conservative methods for
multiple comparison corrections such as Bonferroni or Sidak. The protocol was not
registered in clinical trials, but was approved and followed by the Ethics Committee
of the Unifesp (São Paulo Federal University). Despite other limitations of the
study, including time and frequency of stimulation and number of subjects, results
indicate a positive and promising therapeutic role for tDCS use in aging-related
working memory dysfunction.

Further research involving larger trials and comparing different clinical protocols
for this cohort is needed until translation to clinical practice can occur. More
systematic research into this treatment alternative might help improve cognitive
dysfunction in aging and related disorders.

This study was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, Federal University of
São Paulo, SP, Brazil.
