Humans have adapted to widespread changes during the past 2 million
years in both environmental and lifestyle factors. This is evident in overall
body alterations such as average height and brain size. Although we can
appreciate the uniqueness of our species in many aspects, molecular variations
that drive such changes are far from being fully known and explained.
Comparative genomics is able to determine variations in genomic sequence that
may provide functional information to better understand species-specific
adaptations. A large number of human-specific genomic variations have been
reported but no currently available dataset comprises all of these, a problem
which contributes to hinder progress in the field.

Results
Here we critically update high confidence human-specific genomic
variants that mostly associate with protein-coding regions and find 856 related
genes. Events that create such human-specificity are mainly gene duplications,
the emergence of novel gene regions and sequence and structural alterations.
Functional analysis of these human-specific genes identifies adaptations to
brain, immune and metabolic systems to be highly involved. We further show that
many of these genes may be functionally associated with neural activity and
generating the expanded human cortex in dynamic spatial and temporal
contexts.

Conclusions
This comprehensive study contributes to the current knowledge by
considerably updating the number of human-specific genes following a critical
bibliographic survey. Human-specific genes were functionally assessed for the
first time to such extent, thus providing unique information. Our results are
consistent with environmental changes, such as immune challenges and alterations
in diet, as well as neural sophistication, as significant contributors to recent
human evolution.

==== Body
Background
Since humans split from the chimpanzee at around 6 million years ago,
the different species of the genus Homo (from which modern humans are now the sole
representative) have evolved very rapidly, apparently superseding all other events
of evolutionary novelty accumulation [1]. Especially prominent differences are observed in aspects such as
height, brain size and changes to our gut and skeleton. Environmental alterations
such as diet and immune challenges are thought to have played a major role in
human-specific adaptations [2,
3]. Although these phenotypic
traits, which have a whole-body effect are more readily noticeable, one can easily
assume humans have also undergone significant change at the microscopic scale. The
question of what makes humans unique at a molecular level is now being more broadly
addressed as new and advanced laboratory and bioinformatics tools are enabling
comparisons between species from genetic and functional perspectives. Genetic
differences between species may have distinct mechanisms of origin, such as
alterations in the cytogenetic architecture, local chromosomal rearrangements, gene
family duplications, single gene modifications, creations or losses, differences in
gene transcription levels and/or patterns and alternative splicing. Functional
differences can be observed in general behaviour or tissue and organ development and
function, and molecularly in circuits, pathways or cellular variation.

Historically, genomic comparisons in this context date back from the
1970s, when studies comparing humans with non-human primates at the karyotype level
were first published, revealing a very close organization of chromosome banding and
identical euchromatin [4]. Later, at the
chromosome level, translocation and fission events were reported as the first
detectable differences between humans and their closest relatives and these were the
known genomic landmarks for the origin of Anthropoids [5, 6]. Further, using
fluorescent in situ hybridization and comparative genomic hybridization arrays,
human-specific segmental duplications and genes displaying human-specific copy
number variation were identified [7].
The first human-chimpanzee comparative genome map was published in 2002 and further
updated in 2005 [8]. Also in 2005
[9], the first attempt to
comprehensively identify human-specific segmental duplications was published from
comparisons with the chimpanzee genome, revealing the extent of such alterations,
which account for ~ 2.7% of the genomic differences between these species. For
comparison, at the nucleotide level, the human and chimpanzee genomes genomes are
estimated to differ by > 30 million single substitutions (or ~ 1.2% of the human
genome) [8].

Although functional differences between humans and other primates are
evident in major morphological features such as the skeleton (e.g. jaws
[10] and hands [11]), hair (humans have thinner hair) and muscle
tissue [12], and global functions
including speech [13] and language
[14], changes in the brain have
presumably had the most significant impact on the human lineage. The size of the
human brain tripled over a period of approximately 2 million years, which overlaps
with the estimated period of transition from Australopithecus to Homo [15]. Comparative neuroanatomy has revealed a
specific expansion of both the neocortex, with increase in size and neuronal
interconnectivity during hominid evolution and the right side of the human brain
compared to chimpanzee [16]. While this
expansion is believed to be important to the emergence of human language and other
high-order cognitive functions, its genetic basis remains largely unknown.

In these last two decades following the first discoveries of genomic
differences between humans and other species, numerous studies have identified
events that generated human-specific genetic features, such as gene duplications,
structural gene alterations and accumulation of significant nucleotide
substitutions. Although many authors have worked to identify the genes associated
with such human-specific genetic features (hereby referred to as ‘human-specific
genes’), no comprehensive and structured list is currently available and the
published literature is redundant (in the sense that the same event or gene is many
times reported in multiple studies) as well as diverse (in the sense that authors
frequently direct their work to different aspects and subsets of genes, thus
producing limited results). In summary, current knowledge on the subject is
scattered and there is an inherent lack of standard, given the diversity of studies
in which one or more human-specific gene is described. Such limitations hinder the
study of human-specific genes at a genomic scale, regardless of information being
publicly available. Through an extensive bibliographic survey, we gathered, curated
and critically assessed the human-specific genes reported in the literature to
provide the most comprehensive list to date. We further use this dataset as a
platform to explore the general impact of these human-specific genes, assessing
their biological impact through functional network and pathway analyses. Finally, we
investigate differential gene expression in subpopulations of glial cells and in
active versus inactive neurons to examine whether the human-specific genes are
involved in specialized neural functions such as cortical development or neuronal
activation. Our results highlight the importance of rapid adaptations in
immunological, neurological and metabolomic areas that likely contribute to human
evolution and identify human-specific genes that are differentially expressed in the
brain.

Results
The generation of a high confidence structured dataset for human-specific
genes
Before describing the obtained results, it is necessary to define
our object of study. In this report we use the term human-specific gene when
referring to a gene impacted by one or more genetic alterations, which seem to
have happened after divergence from non-human primates (usually proposed by
genomic comparison with chimpanzee) and result in the emergence of
human-specific features. The event causing these genetic alterations may change
the gene itself or its regulatory region, as we report in detail.

An extensive bibliographic survey (described within the Materials
and Methods section) of the literature published since 2000 resulted on a
selective list of 54 scientific articles describing thousands of human-specific
features. After triage and manual curation of the data we obtained a set of 982
associated gene descriptors. A descriptor was the most accurate term used by the
original author(s) to describe the gene of interest (e.g. name, acronym,
database entry number, etc). To standardize notation, for each gene we retrieved
information from the human genome version GRCh38. Automatic annotation based on
gene descriptor was carried out against the genome and 676 of these genes were
directly annotated. Additionally, some gene names contained typos or were
slightly modified from their actual name and over 100 other genes had been
renamed or restructured since their first annotation. For such genes we carried
out manual curation and further annotation when possible. In addition to these
individual genes, there are 19 gene families, comprising at least 10 members
each, with reported human-specific features that could not be individually
attributed to a single gene (Additional file 1 Table S1). Although these gene families were treated
separately (to avoid introducing bias given the high number of genes they
encompass), when specific genes were described in the literature these were
included in the main dataset.

Approximately 130 of the original descriptors could not be
associated to any particular gene or gene family, many of these representing
genomic fragments as opposed to specific genes and others obsolete or
untraceable gene identifiers (IDs). A total of 856 genes (or 871 gene IDs, as
some names map to multiple gene IDs, e.g. HAR1A and OR5AL1) with reported
human-specific characteristics were curated and annotated and, to the best of
our knowledge, comprise the most complete dataset of human-specific genomic
features (Additional file 1 Table S1).
This number is considerably higher than previously predicted or reported in the
literature. For example, the genetics domain of the Matrix of Comparative
Anthropogeny (MOCA), which is a repository for available information on human
features that differ from great apes, lists only 103 genes known from
literature. From these, over 70% are represented in our dataset and most of the
remaining were either absent in the current version of the human genome or were
filtered out during our manual curation process for lacking strong evidence of
human specificity at the gene level.

Associated to these genes there are many types of human-specific
genetic features and we grouped these in broader classes according to their
causative events, also keeping the original description obtained from the
correspondent publication from which they were retrieved. All human-specific
genes were allocated in one of the 10 following classes (in order of abundance):
gene amplification, human-specific gene (undefined feature), gene sequence
alteration, gene structure alteration, gene loss, regulatory region alteration,
de novo origin, new non-coding gene, lost in chimpanzee and human accelerated
region (Fig. 1a). Most genes reported in
these articles are protein-coding and thus the resulting database is mainly
composed of such genes (588). There are also a large proportion of pseudogenes
(186) and non-coding RNAs (55 long ncRNAs and 27 small ncRNAs).Fig. 1 a The pie chart
illustrates the distribution of 845 genes with human-specific
features with regards to the underlying mechanism from which
they originated. A more specific classification is shown in the
Additional Table 1, as well as additional information for each
gene. b Functional network of
metagroups defined by GeneTerm Linker, represented with FGNet.
The 23 metagroups were filtered to allow visualization of
metagroups comprising functional terms at organism level and
omitting metagroups describing broad cell-level or
molecular-level characteristics, which can be assessed from
Additional Fig. 1. The
color scheme was maintained in all networks to allow
comparison



Regarding chromosomal distribution, the 856 genes with
human-specific features come from all 22 autosome chromosomes and both sexual
chromosomes. No gene was listed from the mitochondrial chromosome. When
proportionally compared, the distribution of protein-coding genes with
human-specific features and the distribution of all human protein-coding genes
per chromosome were relatively similar. A few chromosomes, however, bear a
significantly higher number of human-specificity in protein-coding regions.
Chromosomes X and 7 seem to be particularly enriched in proteins encoded by
genes with human-specific features (Additional file 1 Table S2).

Although this report successfully listed hundreds of genes, it was
limited not only by the current availability of studies regarding human-specific
genes, but also by poorly defined terminology (the term ‘human-specific’ per se
is object of debate, being ambiguously used to describe different levels of
specificity). The field itself is specially limited by technical difficulties,
such as the lack of a high-quality genome for archaic hominins, complexity of
our gene architecture, poorly defined non-coding elements, problems faced when
defining genomic correspondence between species, availability of functional data
and complications of subsequent validation of predicted variation.

Functional analyses highlight neuronal, immunological and metabolic
features
In possession of the newly generated dataset of genes with
human-specific features, we set to investigate the general biological impact
that altering their characteristics may have posed to our species. To this end
we focus on the functional analysis of each human-specific gene searching
further for overall patterns and relationships. Functional enrichment analysis
was performed by FGNet [17] using
GeneTerm Linker [18] as the
underlying algorithm. The resulting network represents the links and
associations between metagroups of genes and enriched terms. In total, 295 genes
(~ 35%) were successfully functionally annotated by FGNet and assigned to 25
metagroups, two of which were automatically filtered out based on silhouette
width. The comprehensive network of metagroups comprising 225 genes is provided
as Additional file 1 Figure S1A and
the description of each metagroup as Additional file 1 Table S3. Reported p-values for all metagroups are lower than 0.0006 (thus orders of
magnitude lower than the threshold of 0.05) and each metagroup has at least 10
genes. Since the full network is highly complex, we manually selected 12
metagroups that we trust represent interesting functional classes of systemic
level (as opposed to broad molecular or cellular level features). This
sub-network clustered into 3 broad functional categories: neural function,
immunological function and metabolic function (Fig. 1b and Additional file 1 Figure S1B).

Although FGNet provides a broad overview of the biological impact
of human-specific genetic alterations by clustering functional terms in
metagroups and establishing relationships between such clusters, it lacks the
detail achieved by analyzing each functional class separately. Also, the subset
of genes for which GeneTerm Linker could attribute information was only around
35% of the total. Therefore, to examine functional aspects of a higher number of
human-specific genes and at a lower scale, we turned to gene ontology (GO)
analysis. In total, 596 gene IDs were assigned to at least one human protein
sequence, obtained from the Ensembl database (~ 70% of the 871 gene IDs), as a
first step for GO annotation. Among the gene IDs for which no protein sequence
was retrieved, 187 (~ 70%) are pseudogenes, 84 (~ 30%) are ncRNAs and only 4 are
currently annotated as protein-coding (despite no correspondent protein
sequences were found). We then assigned functional attributes at the gene level,
both for the set of human-specific genes and for the entire set of human
proteins, which was used to provide expected abundances. Attributes were
assigned to each gene based on the GOSlim catalogue of ontologies for biological
processes. We calculated the percentual abundance for each term among
human-specific genes and compared with the expected abundance based on
observations in all human proteins. Numeric and statistical comparisons indicate
the functional terms which are most significantly differentially represented
among human-specific genes. Only 3 of the 70 broad GOSlim terms assigned to the
entire set of known human proteins were completely absent among the
human-specific genes. Among the remaining terms, 11 were significantly
over-represented (p-values lower than or
equal to 0.05) within human-specific genes when compared with the entire set of
human proteins (15 other terms had p-values lower than or equal to 0.1;
Fig. 2). Enriched terms were
involved with neurological system, carbohydrate metabolism, structural growth
and functions at the cell level, such as cytoskeleton organization, motility,
morphogenesis, locomotion, cell signaling, protein targeting, protein
modification and cellular component assembly (Fig. 2). Additionally, interesting terms such as reproduction and
symbiosis (encompassing mutualism through parasitism) were highly represented
among the human-specific genes, (although their p-values were of 0.06 and 0.1, respectively). It is worth
mentioning that the term symbiosis in this context was almost entirely related
with parasite-host relationships, (50% of the occurrences of this umbrella term
related to virus-host interactions) and the term reproduction mostly refers to
male reproduction (with 40% occurrences, while the remaining 60% are almost
equally shared between female reproduction, general development of the
reproductive system and pregnancy-related processes, which encompass
fertilization, embryonic and placental development and birth). In summary, based
on ontology assignments and subsequent statistical analysis, we highlight that
the higher order categories of neural function, carbohydrate metabolism,
reproduction and parasite-host relationships are highly correlated with
human-specific gene features.Fig. 2 Evidence for enrichment of different gene ontology (GO)
terms within the set of genes with human-specific features. Blue
bars represent the percentage of genes with human-specific
features for which at least one protein product has been
associated to a specific GO term. Red bars represent this
percentage at the gene level for the entire set of human
proteins. Statistical significance of each differentially
represented term was assessed using a Fisher exact test.
Significant p-values are
indicated (*p-value ≤0.1;
**p-value ≤0.05) and the
correspondent term is highlighted in green or brown,
respectively



Focusing on pathways as opposed to individual categories or broad
clusters of functions, we further analyzed human-specific genes using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA; [19]). In
summary, IPA analysis used 729 out of the 845 genes (~ 85%) and supported the
importance of neuronal (e.g. mNOS signaling in neurons, Huntington’s disease
signaling), immunological (e.g. phagosome formation, phagocytosis in
macrophages) and metabolic (e.g. inositol pyrophosphates biosynthesis,
adipogenesis pathway, glutamate biosynthesis and degradation) functions
(Additional file 1 Figure S2). Taken
together multiple functional analyses tools have converged to generally
implicate neuronal, immunological and metabolic systems with human evolution and
species-specific characteristics.

Highly expressed human-specific genes are cell-type enriched across
different radial glial cell populations
Since the human brain has such remarkable properties, with many
cognitive traits being postulated to be unique to our species [20], we turned to investigate the unique
expression profile of human-specific genes within glial cell subpopulations
(which ensure homeostasis and provide support and protection to neuronal cells
in the brain). The cell populations we selected as object of study are
distinctively located at the subventricular zone, a well known center for
neuronal cell production in primates. The expression of human-specific genes in
such location could be related with the unique enlargement and folding of the
human brain, driven by neocortical expansion (see [21] for further information). Using publicly
available samples retrieved from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) we have
assessed transcript abundance for the set of human embryonic radial glial cells,
outer radial glial cells, intermediate progenitor cells and neuron cells (study
SRP094417). We used FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million
mapped reads) values calculated with RSEM as expression measures. A consistent
number of transcripts was shown to be expressed (at any level) across all 4 sets
of samples and these represent approximately 10% of the ~ 200,000 transcripts in
the reference transcriptome. We defined highly expressed transcripts as the top
~ 10% of the expressed transcripts, i.e. the 2000 transcripts with highest
average FPKM values for each set of samples. Highly expressed transcripts were
then mapped to their gene of origin (on average ~ 1580 genes were characterized
as highly expressed) and compared with the set of 856 genes with human-specific
features. We retrieved 23 highly expressed human-specific genes from the radial
glial cell samples, 17 from the outer radial glial cell samples, 26 from the
progenitor cells samples and 24 from the neuron cell samples. The list of
transcripts related to these human-specific genes as well as their estimated
expression in each cell population is available as Additional file 1 Table S4. From the non-redundant total of 61
genes overall, 43 (> 70%) were highly expressed in a cell-specific manner
(Fig. 3). The heatmap represents
expression levels for the set of transcripts associated with these 43 genes
(which generate 52 transcripts) across all 4 cell populations (Fig. 3b). We thus have uncovered sets of
human-specific genes for which all transcripts are highly expressed in specific
cells and have very low expression across all other 3 cell types (i.e. are
virtually cell-specific). Many of these genes have been previously implicated
with human phenotypes, including developmental delay (e.g. ASPM [22], AFF3 [23] and MAPT [24]) and intellectual disability (e.g. NEMF [25], PI4KA [26] and KANSL1 [27]).Fig. 3 a The upper panel
depicts differentiation stages of human radial glia cells. Rows
represent the correspondent brain location and columns represent
the different cell types along a virtual timeline. Cell location
starts from the inner layer of the ventricular zone (the inner
subventricular zone VZ/iSZ) and goes through the outer
subventricular zone (oSZ) to the region between the intermediate
zone and the cortical plate (IZ/CP). b The heatmap is a graphical representation of
normalized read counts (FPKM values) across all samples for each
transcript of highly expressed genes with human-specific
features. Color intensity varies according to FPKM value as
shown in the scale. Highly expressed genes were defined as the
top 2000 in terms of FPKM and those that were highly expressed
in at least one of the four cell stages were selected. The first
12 genes are highly expressed in radial glial cells, the next 3
genes (light grey shade) in outer radial glia, the further 15 in
intermediate progenitor cells and the last 13 (light grey shade)
in differentiated neurons. The columns of the heatmap represent
different samples of each cell type (the 4 radial glia samples,
4 outer radial glia samples, 4 intermediate progenitor samples
and 6 neuron samples)



Multiple human-specific genes are differentially expressed upon activation
in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)
As another example of roles human-specific genes may perform in the
brain, we carried out RNA-Seq analyses of neurons differentiated from human iPSC
before and after cell activation (50 mM KCl for 3 h) to investigate differential
expression of human-specific genes upon neuronal activation. As a result, 798
transcripts were shown to be differentially expressed, 407 being under-expressed
upon activation and 391 over-expressed. These transcripts correspond to 755
genes, 12 of which have human-specific features (Fig. 4a, b). These 12 genes have multiple roles and some are
implicated in synaptic function (e.g. SEPT7 [28] and CAPN1 [29]) and neurological diseases (e.g. AFF3 [30], NLGN4X [31], CAPN1 [32]
and KIAA0319L [31]). We performed
RT-qPCR to validate the expression profile of these genes and found 4 of these
to be significantly altered after 3 h KCl activation AFF3, KIAA0319L, PPIP5K2
and SLC7A6 (Fig. 4c).Fig. 4 a The diagram

human-specific features and the set of genes that undergo

expression was investigated by RT-qPCR using RNA from the same
samples of active and inactive iPSC-derived neurons. Fold-change
values were calculated relative to GAPDH expression. Statistical significance was
performed using unpaired t-test (*p-value < 0.05; ***p value < 0.001)



Discussion
We set out to survey the scientific literature for genes previously
reported as human-specific, knowing a better understanding of how these genes have
mechanistically impacted our evolution would be broadly beneficial for the study of
human physiology and disease. The resulting dataset of genes associated with
human-specific variants is, to the best of our knowledge, the most detailed,
structured and comprehensive to date. Here we highlight higher order functional
areas which house a large number of human-specific genes and are likely to by
impacted by these genes and their products. Functional assessment of more than 850
human-specific genes emphasized the significance of brain, immune and metabolic
adaptations.

In hindsight these findings may not be completely unexpected as
infections, dietary alterations (coincident with the discovery of tools and the
domestication of fire for cooking) and extraordinary brain expansion have been well
documented.

Although humans possess a great degree of plasticity for adaptation, it
is likely that the real origin of the human adaptations that truly ignited human
uniqueness occurred during the time of Australopithecus and early Homo species
[33, 34]. At this time there was widespread movement, the emergence of
tools, an enlargement of the brain and a decrease in masticatory apparatus relative
to an increasing body size. The human brain has evolved rapidly in the past 2
million years (coincidental with the emergence of Homo species) and continues to do
so through highly unstable, or rather adaptable, regions in our genome,
tissue-specific and function-specific gene expression and reorganized circuitry
[35]. Nevertheless, it was very
likely a conjunction of factors that enabled human evolution to occur at such a
rapid rate. For example, newly formed regions of the human brain such as the
prefrontal cortex seem to have far higher energy requirements than more conserved
regions [36]. It may be that it was
only possible to meet such requirements through modifications to food preparation
methods that ultimately resulted in higher energy intake [37]. This example could illustrate a crosstalk
between different aspects of human evolution which may have resulted in emergent
properties of our species. Significant changes are also observed in local
adaptations in recent human populations to environmental and behavioral factors such
as diet, infections, altitude and temperature [38]. Emerging pathogens that specifically infect humans have to
some degree been impacted by our own innovations, such as agriculture, and continue
to shape our immune evolution through host-pathogen interactions [39].

Conclusions
Despite limitations, our comprehensive study contributes to the current
knowledge by considerably updating the number of human-specific genes and further
emphasizing the importance of brain, immune and metabolic adaptation in defining our
species. It also highlights the potential significance of considering metabolism in
conjunction with brain function to fully understand human-specific function and
disease.

Materials and methods
Database of genes with human-specific features
We have extensively scanned and curated the current literature and
searched for articles describing human-specific genetic features and its
associated genes. PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) was used as the search platform with the criteria “Search human
specific gene Filters: Publication date from 2000/01/01 to 2017/12/31” (further
expanded to 2019/12/31), which resulted in over 218,000 publications. From these
articles, we selected for terms such as “human-specific”, “duplication”, “de
novo”, “evolution” among other terms of interest. Studies were also assessed
regarding their relevance/direct relation to the topic, design of the study,
type of publication and whether or not the publication was peer reviewed. An
initial subset of 36 highly relevant and non-redundant studies were selected and
further expanded (mainly through citation relationships) to 54 references from
which data were retrieved. These articles report human-specific genetic
features, i.e. gene-related molecular characteristics that have been reported to
differ between humans and other species and are likely to impact the associated
gene (such as changes to the sequence of a gene promoter, exon losses, gene
duplications, etc). The genetic features are related to specific genes, which
are the object of study of the present work. Gene names were listed and
duplicated entries were collapsed. Ambiguities were assessed in as much detail
as possible to clarify the specific gene authors referred to. The initial list
was mapped back to the GRCh38 version of the human genome and remaining
non-annotated entries mainly represented genes that have been renamed or
excluded since their first annotation. The final set of genes was categorized
according to the reported human-specific feature and grouped by biotypes as
proposed in the Ensembl glossary (publicly available at ensembl.org/Help/Glossary).

Chromosomal distribution of human-specific protein-coding genes
There are 596 gene IDs associated with protein-coding genes. These
were listed regarding their chromosome of origin and the proportion of entries
per chromosome was calculated. The same was performed with the entire set of
protein-coding genes annotated in the human genome, for comparison. In parallel,
we used the GeneOverlap library (version 1.12.0) of the R package to infer
significance of overlapping genes. The internal algorithm for Fisher’s exact
test used by this package determined the respective p-values (which were not corrected for multiple
hypothesis).

Functional analysis of genes with human-specific features
Genes were also subject to functional analyses for the generation
of a protein-protein interaction network and functional clusterization using the
Bioconductor package FGNet version 3.10.0 [17] and GeneTerm Linker [18] for functional enrichment analysis. Metagroups with
silhouette width of less than 0 were excluded and a minimum support of 3 genes
was required for cluster validation.

Human protein sequences were obtained from Ensembl GRCh38
[40] and genes with
human-specific features had their respective protein sequence(s) retrieved. The
retrieved sequences were submitted to AgBase GoAnna version 2.0.0 [41] for GO assignment based on sequence
homology. Blastp was used as the underlying algorithm and search parameters were
an E-value cutoff of 10e-50, BLOSUM62 as the substitution matrix, a minimum of
80% sequence identity plus 75% coverage and default word size and gap penalty
values. GoAnna results were submitted to AgBase GOSlim [41] to obtain high-level summaries of
functions for the given dataset and further analyses were restricted to
categories of biological processes, which involve pathways and activities of
multiple genes. The same protocol was used to assign GOSlim terms to the entire
set of human proteins obtained from Ensembl. Results report the percentual of
each term both in the set of human-specific proteins and all human proteins,
which was used as background. Against this background of expected abundance,
significance for differential representation of functional terms within the
human-specific subset of proteins was calculated using Fisher’s exact test
(implemented in the GeneOverlap library of the R package version 1.12.0) to
determine the respective p-values (which were
not corrected for multiple hypothesis).

SRA samples of radial glial cells
We retrieved fastq files from the SRA-deposited study SRP094417,
which contains 18 runs from samples of prenatal human brain, representing data
with replicates from radial glial cells, outer radial glial, intermediate
progenitor and mature neuronal cells. Reads are paired-end and were generated
from cDNA with the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform in 2016.

RNA-Seq of iPSC
The generation and activation of human iPSC-derived neurons and RNA
isolation, preparation and sequencing were described in a previous report by our
group [42].

RNA-Seq analysis
Both the set of iPSC and SRA-retrieved RNA-Seq samples were treated
with the same bioinformatics pipeline, which is composed of 5 main steps: (1)
Pre-trimming quality control with FastQC version 0.11.5 (bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc); (2) Read trimming with Trimmomatic version 0.36
[43]; (3) Post-trimming quality
control with FastQC; (4) Alignment or pseudoalignment to reference transcriptome
and read counting for transcript abundance estimation with Kallisto version
0.43.0 or STAR-RSEM versions 2.5.2a and 1.2.30 [44–46]; (5) Measurement of differential
expression of transcripts with EdgeR version 3.18.1 [47]. Each step is generally described
below.

FastQC was used for quality control of raw reads and a comparative
round of quality control after running Trimmomatic, to ensure overall quality
was either maintained or increased after read trimming. The set of default
parameters was used for this step. Trimmomatic was employed for cleaning reads
from sequencing artifacts. The set of Illumina adapters for the TruSeq
paired-end library preparation kit was used as database for adapter trimming.
Reads were scanned with a 4-base wide sliding window and trimmed when the
average quality per base was lower than 20. Reads shorter than 40 bases after
trimming were further excluded. Kallisto and STAR-RSEM were used as different
alternatives to generate read counts. Kallisto performs pseudoalignments and
read counts within the same command line, while STAR performs alignments to the
reference transcriptome and the result is used by RSEM to generate read counts.
Kallisto indexing tool was used to generate an index for the FASTA formatted
file of the human transcriptome with k-mer size of 31. Reads were counted for
transcript quantification using default parameters and a number of bootstrap
samples of 100. As an alternative to estimate transcript abundance, STAR was
used to perform alignments between the paired-end reads and the reference human
transcriptome. An index was built with default parameters and the alignment was
performed discarding multimappers and defining parameters for splicing
treatment. Resulting bam alignment files were further converted to sam files
using Samtools (samtools.sourceforge.net) and sorted with Novosort (novocraft.com/products/novosort), as an intermediate step. RSEM was used to prepare a reference
file from the human transcriptome and count reads to provide transcript
abundance in the paired-end mode. EdgeR was used to perform statistical analysis
and define differentially expressed genes. Kallisto and STAR-RSEM results were
compared to evaluate data robustness. In summary, when results were
qualitatively similar, parameters were considered well adjusted. After assessing
different thresholds, a minimum of 5 reads per transcript before normalization
was needed to validate expression. Read counts generated by STAR-RSEM were used
for differential expression assessment. Samples were normalized based on sample
sizes and data variability was estimated according to a negative binomial
dispersion parameter. Differential expression was reported with limits being ap-value of less than 0.001 and false
discovery rate of less than 0.01.

Quantitative RT-PCR for differentially expressed human-specific genes in
iPSC data
Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate expression patterns for
the subset of genes with human-specific features shown to be differentially
expressed in iPSC. cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III
First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Briefly, 500 ng of
total RNA was used and random hexamer primed protocol was followed. Each cDNA
sample was amplified in triplicate using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher
Scientific, USA). Primer pairs used for this analysis are described in
Additional file 1 Table S5.

Additional file

Additional file 1: Table S1. The
screenshot above represents the first lines of the table.
The full version is given as an independent Supplementary
Table in xls format. This file contains all 845 genes with
humanspecific features retrieved in this study (Sheet 1 -
"HumanSpecific genes") and describes for each gene its: (A)
Gene name (updated to the current Ensembl description, when
necessary); (B) Ensembl ID; (C) Chromosome number; (D) Gene
type (the specific type, as described by Ensembl); (E)
General gene type (a general classification which may group
multiple gene types - e.g. pseudogenes includes processed,
unprocessed and transcribed pseudogenes); (F) Mechanism of
origin (specifically as described by the author of the
correspondent reference); (G) General mechanism of origin (a
manually assigned general classification which may group
multiple subclasses from column (F) - data from this column
was used to generate the pie chart presented in Figure
1a in the main
manuscript) and (H) At least one reference in which the gene
is reported (the full list of references, numbered
accordingly, is given as Sheet 2 - "References"). The file
also contains information on 19 large gene families (Sheet 3
- "HumanSpecific GeneFamilies"), described as undergoing
significant expansion or accelerated evolution across all
(or many of) its members. These were not included in the
main table, mainly to prevent their high gene numbers to
introduce a functional bias in the dataset. Table S2. This table presents the
percentage of protein-coding genes in each chromosome (A),
both for the set of genes with human-specific features (B)
and the entire set of human proteins retrieved from the
Ensembl database (C). A p-value is given (D), generated with
a Fisher's exact test to represent the significance of the
difference between (B) and (C) per chromosome. Chromosomes X
and 7 are clearly enriched in genes with human-specific
features and another four (in green) have significantly more
of such genes than expected. Table
S3. This table describes the metagroups
generated by GeneTerm Linker using FGNet. The metagroup
number corresponds to numbers in Supplementary Figures 1A
and 1B (and information can be transferred to Figure 1B in
the manuscript). For each metagroup this file presents its
silhouette size (a clustering coefficient), significance
(p-value), number of constituent genes and constituent
functional terms (or, for metagroups 1 and 6, which do not
meet inclusion cutoffs, their exclusion criteria). The last
column on the right describes functional terms in each
metagroup and their annotation space, which can be a gene
ontology assignment (GO for biological process, molecular
function or cellular component), a KEGG pathway or a
function inferred from the description of InterPro motifs or
domains (IPR).Table S4.
This table presents gene expression levels (in FPKM) for
transcripts related to 61 humanspecific genes which were
characterized as highly expressed in at least one
subpopulation of glial cell (sequencing data retrieved from
SRA). Highly expressed transcripts were defined as the top
~10% of the expressed transcripts (i.e. the 2,000
transcripts) with highest average FPKM values for each set
of samples under investigation. On average ~1580 genes were
characterized as highly expressed in each cell type and
compared with the set of 856 genes with human-specific
features. We retrieved 23 highly expressed human-specific
genes from the radial glial cell samples, 17 from the outer
radial glial cell samples, 26 from the progenitor cells
samples and 24 from the neuron cell samples, resulting in a
set of 61 nonredundant genes and 91 transcripts. Table S5. Primers designed for
each of the 12 genes described in the Figure 4 of the main manuscript.
Gene names and accession numbers are also provided.Figure S1. These
functional networks describe the set of genes with
human-specific features. The network outputs were generated
with FGNet to represent the metagroups defined with GeneTerm
Linker. Individual files are provided to allow assessment of
gene names and network topology. A) From a total of 25
metagroups (clusters of associated genes with coherent
biological significance), 2 were filtered out for not
meeting the parameters for measuring relevance, in terms of
significance and coherence. The remaining 23 metagroups
represent 225 genes and many different functions, including
neuronal, metabolic and immunological. Metagroups are
color-coded and their full description is given in the
Supplementary Table 3. Gene names and network topology can
be better visualized when magnified. White circles denote
genes shared by multiple metagroups. Figure S2. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) is an additional tool for functional analysis of
highthroughput sequencing data. In this figure we present
results generated using IPA for the set of genes with
human-specific features. This result includes >85% of the
845 genes in the dataset and describes these in terms of the
pathways in which they function. A) The plot presents
category scores. The "threshold" line (vertical line in
light orange, set here to 1.25) indicates the minimum
significance level in terms of inverse logarithmic p values [-log(p-value)]
derived from performing a Fisher’s exact test. The
proportion of genes in the dataset that map to each pathway
in the IPA knowledgebase is represented as the "ratio" (line
in darker orange). The z-score is color-coded and refers to
the difference between observed and predicted up/down
regulation states of pathways. B) The table shows
higher-order functional classes with their respective
significance (p values)
and the number of genes (molecules) by which they are
composed. (PDF 2947 kb)
