quality of life (HRQoL) in adult ADHD. Method: U.K. residents aged
18 to 55 years with ADHD and no major mental health comorbidities completed an
online survey of disorder history, the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L),
and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health
(WPAI:GH). ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) score was assessed by telephone.
Results: In total, 233 participants completed the study (mean
age 32.6 years; 65.2% women). Mean (SD) ADHD-RS-IV total score,
EQ-5D utility, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were 43.5 (7.88), 0.74
(.21), and 69.8 (17.76), respectively. Mean (SD) WPAI:GH scores
indicated that health problems caused 45.7% (29.9) overall work impairment and
45.8% (28.9) impairment in regular daily activities. Greater work and activity
impairment were both significantly independently associated with lower utility
after adjusting for age, gender, and somatic comorbidities.
Conclusion: Adult ADHD impairs HRQoL, work productivity, and
regular daily activities.

==== Body
Introduction
Recognized as one of the most common psychiatric disorders among children and
adolescents, ADHD is also known to persist into adulthood in approximately two
thirds of cases (Cheung et al.,
2016; Faraone,
Biederman, & Mick, 2006; Kooij et al., 2010). Indeed, ADHD is
estimated to affect around 3% to 4% of adults worldwide (de Graaf et al., 2008; Fayyad et al., 2007; Kessler et al., 2006).
While the disorder is characterized by the core symptoms of hyperactivity,
impulsivity, and inattention, ADHD diagnosis also requires significant
psychological, social, and/or educational or occupational impairment (American Psychiatric Association,
2013; National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE], 2008a). The impairments
associated with ADHD evolve as an individual matures and as in adulthood the need
for personal organization increases, the disorder often presents as internal
restlessness, impatience, distractibility, disorganization, forgetfulness, and poor
timekeeping (Asherson, Manor,
& Huss, 2014). Emotional dysregulation (irritability, mood swings,
and volatile temper outbursts) is also common (Asherson et al., 2014). In addition, adult
ADHD is associated with a wide range of psychosocial impairments (Brod, Pohlman, Lasser, &
Hodgkins, 2012; Pitts, Mangle, & Asherson, 2015; Ramos-Quiroga, Montoya, Kutzelnigg, Deberdt, &
Sobanski, 2013) including lower educational attainment and poorer
workplace performance (de Graaf
et al., 2008; Ebejer
et al., 2012; Kessler
et al., 2005), and difficulties establishing and sustaining close
personal relationships (Biederman, Faraone et al., 2006; Brod, Schmitt, Goodwin, Hodgkins, & Niebler,
2012; Das, Cherbuin,
Butterworth, Anstey, & Easteal, 2012; Pitts et al., 2015). In the family
environment, some adults with ADHD lack appropriate parenting techniques and report
more family conflicts (Biederman,
Faraone, & Monuteaux, 2002; Brod, Pohlman, et al., 2012; Chronis-Tuscano et al.,
2008).

Studies conducted in Canada, Europe, Israel, Taiwan, and the United States indicate
that ADHD adversely affects health-related quality of life (HRQoL; Chao et al., 2008; Gjervan, Torgersen, & Hjemdal,
2016; Grenwald-Mayes,
2002; Karlsdotter et
al., 2016; Lensing,
Zeiner, Sandvik, & Opjordsmoen, 2015; Rimmerman, Yurkevich, Birger, Azaiza, &
Elyashar, 2007; van
Hout et al., 2012) in multiple domains. These include life productivity,
psychological health, relationships, life outlook (Adler et al., 2013; Brod, Johnston, Able, & Swindle, 2006),
work productivity (Brod,
Schmitt, et al., 2012), psychosocial well-being (Matza et al., 2004), life enjoyment and
satisfaction (Mick, Faraone,
Spencer, Zhang, & Biederman, 2008). Few studies, however, have
assessed the impact of ADHD on health utility in adults—a disease-independent
measure of HRQoL commonly used to inform guideline development and decision-making.
Those studies that have assessed health utility recruited populations with a high
rate of psychiatric comorbidities, making it difficult to identify the independent
impact of ADHD (Karlsdotter et
al., 2016; Lensing et
al., 2015; van Hout
et al., 2012).

Here we present the results of a web-based survey of adults resident in the United
Kingdom who report a diagnosis of ADHD and no major comorbid mental health
disorders. The study was designed to evaluate the impact of ADHD on HRQoL using the
EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), and on work and regular daily activities
using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health
(WPAI:GH) assessment.

Method
Study Design Overview
Adults reporting a formal diagnosis of ADHD whose responses to a self-completed
online ADHD assessment were aligned with Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American Psychiatric
Association, 2013) criteria for adult ADHD participated in an online
survey and subsequent telephone interview. Information requested from
participants in the online survey included sociodemographic characteristics,
ADHD disorder history, chronic medical (somatic) comorbidities, EQ-5D-5L
responses, and WPAI:GH assessment. ADHD severity was assessed using the ADHD
Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) with adult prompts administered by a trained
interviewer via telephone.

The study protocol and survey materials were approved by an independent review
board before study initiation to cover data collection in the United Kingdom
(Salus institutional review board, protocol number 0238-0256, approved February
19, 2015). Informed consent was collected online and all data were anonymized
before analysis.

Recruitment of a sample of 300 adults was planned to allow for the identification
of significant differences, at the 5% level (α = .05) and with 80% power,
between two groups of participants of equal size equivalent to a moderate effect
size of ≈0.3 SDs (Cohen, 1988) and, in the whole sample,
to provide a confidence interval (CI) of maximum width ±5% around a
percentage.

Participants and Screening
Eligible participants were aged 18 to 55 years, reported a formal diagnosis of
ADHD, were resident in the United Kingdom, and were able to give informed
consent. A specialist patient research and fieldwork agency (Opinion Health,
London, UK) used these criteria to identify and contact (via email) individuals
from their patient community who had previously provided consent to be contacted
should they be potentially eligible for inclusion in a study. These individuals
had been recruited through patient associations or through a range of
traditional recruitment activities. Study participants received a £30 voucher or
check as reimbursement for their time.

Screening consisted of an online form to determine study eligibility followed by
a self-completed online ADHD assessment. Patients were excluded if they
self-reported one or more of the following comorbid major mental health
disorders, presented as a checklist on the screening form: Asperger’s syndrome,
autism, schizophrenia, psychosis, severe depression/mania, drug addiction,
severe anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Identity checks were
conducted during the screening process, via Internet protocol (IP) address, to
ensure that each participant was resident in the United Kingdom and completed
screening only once. The self-completed online ADHD assessment was used for
screening purposes only and included questions about participants’ ADHD symptoms
(aligned with the 18 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association,
1994)/DSM-5 adult ADHD items) along with questions
about how long these challenges had been present, and their impact on multiple
areas of daily life. Patients whose responses were consistent with the
DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013),
including onset before starting secondary school, were directed to the online
survey.

The Survey
The survey comprised four main components: (a) the participant description; (b)
the EQ-5D-5L; (c) the WPAI:GH; and (d) the ADHD-RS-IV (telephone interview).

The participant description comprised questions regarding sociodemographic
characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, highest level of education, employment
status) and ADHD disorder history (age of first ADHD diagnosis, type of medical
professional service making first diagnosis, age of a more recent ADHD diagnosis
[if applicable], age of perceived ADHD symptom onset, current use of ADHD
medication [yes/no], current use of nonpharmacological ADHD treatment
[checklist]). Participants also filled in a checklist to report on the presence
of common chronic medical (somatic) comorbidities known to affect HRQoL: asthma,
angina, cancer, chronic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
chronic renal disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and other.

The EQ-5D is a generic preference-based measure of health status that has been
validated as a practical tool to assess HRQoL in the general population and many
patient groups (EuroQol
Group, 1990; Herdman et al., 2011; Kind, Dolan, Gudex, & Williams,
1998; Peters,
Crocker, Jenkinson, Doll, & Fitzpatrick, 2014). The EQ-5D
classifies health state across five domains: mobility, self-care, usual
activities (work, study, housework, family, and leisure), pain/discomfort, and
anxiety/depression. For each domain, the EQ-5D-5L instrument (EuroQol Group, 2009)
includes five possible levels of severity resulting in 3,125 possible
combinations or health states (Herdman et al., 2011). Each health
state is allocated a health “utility” value on a scale anchored at 1
(best possible health) and 0 (dead), which
is weighted using value sets that represent the preferences of the general
population (Devlin &
Krabbe, 2013). In the present study, EQ-5D-5L responses were
converted to utilities using the validated EuroQol mapping (crosswalk) function
(van Hout et al.,
2012) and established U.K. preference values (Dolan, Gudex, Kind, & Williams,
1995). The EQ-5D-5L also incorporates a visual analog scale (VAS) for
respondents to rate their health from 100 (best health you can
imagine) to 0 (worst health you can imagine)
(EuroQol Group,
2009). Thus, a low EQ-5D utility or VAS score indicates poor
preference for a health state.

The WPAI:GH is a validated instrument that measures the effect of health
problems, defined as any physical or emotional problem or symptom, on work
productivity and regular daily activities within the previous 7 days (Reilly, Zbrozek, & Dukes,
1993). The four outcome measures quantify the effect of health
problems on proportion of work time missed, percentage impairment while working,
percentage overall work impairment (a combination of the “work time missed” and
“impairment while working” measures), and percentage impairment on ability to do
regular daily activities. Individuals reporting that they are not “currently
employed (working for pay)” are assessed only on the activity impairment measure
(Reilly Associates,
2004).

The severity of participants’ ADHD symptoms was assessed by trained interviewers
via telephone using the ADHD-RS-IV with adult prompts. The ADHD-RS-IV consists
of the 18 DSM-IV/5 items: nine for inattentiveness symptoms and
nine for hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. The severity of each symptom is rated
on a 4-point scale from 0 (none) to 3
(severe), and these values are summed to give the total
score.

Data Analysis
In descriptive analyses, responses to individual questions were summarized using
means with SD, and response frequencies as n
(%). The uncertainty in the sample estimates is captured by 95% CIs. In
inferential analyses to examine factors associated with ADHD-RS-IV total scores,
EQ-5D utilities, EQ-5D VAS scores, and WPAI:GH outcomes, significance was
assessed using t tests or analyses of variance, as appropriate.
Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationships between
continuous variables. Linear regression was used to adjust for the possible
confounding variables of age, gender, and presence of chronic medical
comorbidities. These possibly confounding variables were entered first in each
model, with subsequent variables added in a stepwise fashion. Significance was
taken throughout at the 5% level (α = .05); however, nominal significance levels
at p < .01 rather than p < .05 are
considered most reliable owing to the number of tests performed and the
descriptive aims of this research. Analyses were conducted in SPSS v19.0 and
Stata v14.0, data were cleaned before analysis, and no data imputation was
performed.

Results
Study Population and Sociodemographic Characteristics
The study took place from June 3, 2015, to October 30, 2015; a diagram of
participant flow through enrollment, screening, follow-up, and analysis is shown
in Figure 1. The initial
screening form was accessed by 3,323 individuals. Of these, 534 were included
and proceeded to the next stage, with 1,701 not meeting inclusion criteria and
1,088 closing their web browser prematurely. The most common reasons for
exclusion were reporting a major mental health comorbidity (n =
1,072) and not having an ADHD diagnosis from a medical professional
(n = 449). Of the 534 individuals who met the initial
inclusion criteria and accessed the online ADHD assessment tool, 158 were
excluded due to responses that were not consistent with the
DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD and 46 closed their web
browser prematurely. The online survey was completed by 330 individuals, of whom
97 were subsequently excluded for not completing the telephone interview
(n = 93) or withdrawing from the study (n
= 4).

The final sample consisted of 233 participants who completed the online survey
and telephone interview. The sociodemographic characteristics of the 233
participants are summarized in Table 1. The mean age of participants
was 32.6 years (SD = 9.5), the majority were women
(n = 152) and most were of White British ethnicity
(n = 180). Approximately one third of participants had
completed a university course (n = 78), and one third were in
full-time employment (n = 80). All surveys and tools were
completed in full by the 233 participants.

Clinical Characteristics and Disorder History
Clinical characteristics and disorder history are summarized in Table 2. The mean age
of initial ADHD diagnosis was 22.98 years (SD = 13.1). Overall,
51.5% of participants were currently taking medications for ADHD. Some
participants were also receiving nonpharmacological ADHD treatment (often in
addition to medication), most commonly behavioral therapy (n =
19) and individual counseling (n = 18). Approximately 40% of
participants reported at least one chronic medical comorbidity, the most common
of which was asthma (n = 48). In the survey, most participants
(87.6%) reported experiencing their first symptoms of ADHD before the age of 13
years. At screening, however, all 233 participants had reported that symptoms
had been present since primary school (typically completed before 12 years of
age in the UK; Government
Digital Service, 2017a, 2017b).

a All participants stated during screening that symptoms of adult ADHD
had started before secondary school but some subsequently reported
an older age in response to the survey question: “At what age do you
think your ADHD symptoms first started?”

b Participants who responded positively to the survey question: “Have
you had another more recent diagnosis of ADHD since your first
diagnosis?”

c Not mutually exclusive.

ADHD Symptom Severity
The mean ADHD-RS-IV total score was 43.46 (SD = 7.88) and was
significantly higher in women (44.22 [SD = 7.77]) than in men
(41.77 [SD = 7.91]) (p = .023). When
ADHD-RS-IV total scores were compared between groups of participants classified
by sociodemographic or disease characteristics, greater symptom severity (higher
ADHD-RS-IV total score) was also significantly associated with not working
(p = .001), not completing school to age 18 years or not
completing university (p = .005), currently receiving
nonpharmacological ADHD treatment (p = .037), and receiving a
first ADHD diagnosis from a psychiatry, psychology, or other service (vs. a
primary care clinic or pediatric service, p < .001) (Table 3). No
significant associations were found between ADHD-RS-IV total scores and age
category, number of medical comorbidities, currently taking medication for ADHD
(vs. not), or age at first or second ADHD diagnosis (data not shown).

Note. Owing to the number of tests performed and the
descriptive aims of this research, nominal significance levels at
p < .01 rather than p <
.05 are considered most reliable. No significant associations were
found between ADHD-RS-IV total scores and age category, number of
medical comorbidities, currently taking medication for ADHD (vs.
not), or age at first or second ADHD diagnosis. ADHD-RS-IV = ADHD
Rating Scale-IV; CI = confidence interval.

Health-Related Quality of Life Assessment: EQ-5D
Overall, mean EQ-5D utility and VAS scores were 0.74 (SD = 0.21)
and 69.81 (SD = 17.76), respectively. These scores are
qualitatively lower than the U.K. population norms for adults aged 18 years and
over (0.86 [SD = 0.23] and 82.48 [SD = 16.96],
respectively) and similar to those reported by adults aged 75 years and over
(Kind, Hardman, &
Macran, 1999).

Lower utilities (poorer HRQoL) were significantly associated with greater ADHD
symptom severity (higher ADHD-RS-IV total scores, r = −.225,
p < .001). Lower utilities were also significantly
associated with lower work productivity due to health problems (higher work time
missed due to health problems [r = −.183, p =
.031], greater impairment while working due to health problems
[r = −.431, p < .001], and greater
overall work impairment due to health problems [r = −.424,
p < .001]), greater activity impairment due to health
problems (r = −.449, p < .001), and older
ages at first and second ADHD diagnosis (r = −.13,
p = .040 and r = −.27, p
= .049, respectively). When utilities were compared between groups of
participants classified by sociodemographic or disease characteristics, lower
utilities (poorer HRQoL) were significantly associated with not working
(p < .001); having chronic medical comorbidities (vs.
not, p < .001); receiving a first ADHD diagnosis from a
psychiatry, psychology, or other service (vs. a primary care clinic or pediatric
service, p < .001); not completing school to age 18 years or
not completing university (p = .033); and older age
(p = .012).

Lower EQ-5D VAS scores were associated with greater WPAI:GH activity impairment
due to health problems (r = −.328, p <
.001), more work time missed due to health problems (r = −.179,
p = .034), greater impairment while working due to health
problems (r = −.237, p = .006), and greater
overall work impairment due to health problems (r = −.250,
p = .004). When EQ-5D VAS scores were compared between
groups of participants classified by sociodemographic or disease
characteristics, lower scores were significantly associated with not working
(p < .001) and with having chronic medical comorbidities
(vs. not, p < .001).

After controlling for age, gender, and the presence of chronic medical
comorbidities, the following significant independent associations were observed:
greater activity impairments due to health problems were associated with lower
EQ-5D utilities (p = .006) and VAS scores (p
< .001), and greater overall work impairments due to health problems were
associated with lower EQ-5D utilities (p = .033). The
regression models indicated that, after controlling for all other factors,
utility decreased by .05 points for each additional decade of age
(p = .001), men had lower utilities than women (by .089
points, p = .001), and participants who reported at least one
chronic medical comorbidity had lower EQ5D VAS scores than those who did not (by
8.588 points, p < .001; Table 4).

Productivity Assessment: WPAI:GH
Mean impairment due to health problems of regular daily activities was 45.79%
(SD = 28.86) in the overall sample of 233 individuals. The
135 participants who indicated that they were “currently employed (working for
pay)” on the WPAI:GH instrument reported a mean proportion of work time missed
due to health problems of 15.71% (SD = 26.48), a mean
impairment while working due to health problems of 40.59% (SD =
27.01), and a mean overall work impairment due to health problems of 45.65%
(SD = 29.86).

Significantly greater activity impairment due to health problems was associated
with greater ADHD symptom severity (higher ADHD-RS-IV total score,
r = .256, p < .001); not working
(p = .011); not currently taking ADHD medication
(p = .027); receiving a first ADHD diagnosis from a
psychiatry, psychology, or other service (vs. a primary care clinic or pediatric
service, p = .009); and older age at first ADHD diagnosis
(r = .209, p = .001). When WPAI:GH
outcomes were compared between groups of participants classified by
sociodemographic or disease characteristics, women reported that health problems
caused significantly more impairment while working (p = .025)
and of regular daily activities (p = .032) than did men.
Participants with at least one chronic medical comorbidity reported that health
problems caused significantly more impairment while working (p
= .032), overall work impairment (p = .024), and activity
impairment (p = .003) than those reporting no medical
comorbidities. Associations between WPAI:GH and EQ-5D outcomes have already been
reported in the previous section.

Regression analyses adjusting for age, gender, and the presence of chronic
medical comorbidities were conducted to identify factors significantly
independently associated with WPAI:GH outcomes. For these analyses, EQ5D utility
was categorized in quartiles owing to nonnormality of the data distribution
(lowest quartile below .68, n = 62; second quartile .68 to .78,
n = 57; third quartile .785 to .85, n =
57; fourth quartile above .85, n = 57). Each of the four
WPAI:GH outcomes was significantly independently associated with lower EQ-5D
utility quartile (p = .033 for work time missed due to health
problems; p < .001 for the other outcomes). In addition,
more work time missed due to health problems was significantly independently
associated with younger age at second ADHD diagnosis (p =
.010). The regression models indicated that, after controlling for all other
factors, women reported that health problems caused more impairment while
working, overall work impairment, and impairment of regular daily activities
than did men (by 14.12 [p = .002], 11.88 [p =
.020], and 8.748 [p = .018] percentage points, respectively;

Discussion
The present study aimed to clarify the impact of ADHD on HRQoL and impairments in
work and regular daily activities in a sample of 233 U.K. residents aged 18 to 55
years with ADHD and no comorbid major mental health disorders. In the sample, more
severe ADHD symptoms were significantly associated with poorer HRQoL (lower
utilities) and greater health-related impairments in regular daily activities.
Observed mean EQ-5D utility and VAS scores were lower than UK norms for the general
population and similar to those reported by adults aged 75 years and over (Kind et al., 1999).
Participants also reported that health problems led to considerable impairment in
work and in regular daily activities.

HRQoL is a multidimensional construct of an individual’s perception of the impact of
his or her health status on physical, psychological, and social functioning. Several
studies around the world have investigated HRQoL in adults with ADHD, with impacts
of ADHD on functioning and HRQoL in adults reported to be similar in several
European and North American countries (Adler et al., 2013; Brod et al., 2006; Brod, Schmitt, et al., 2012; Chao et al., 2008; Gjervan et al., 2016; Grenwald-Mayes, 2002; Karlsdotter et al., 2016;
Lensing et al., 2015;
Matza et al., 2004;
Mick et al., 2008;
Rimmerman et al.,
2007). Previous studies in which the impact of ADHD on health utility in
adults was assessed, however, recruited populations with a high rate of psychiatric
comorbidities, making it difficult to identify the independent impact of the
disorder (Karlsdotter et al.,
2016; Lensing et al.,
2015; van Hout et
al., 2012). Health utilities are important because they can be used to
estimate quality-adjusted life-years, which are central to guideline development and
decision-making for health care provision. The U.K. NICE (NICE) states that, for
appraisals of health technologies (e.g., medications and devices), the EQ-5D is the
preferred measure of HRQoL and utility in adults, and that other measures should be
mapped to EQ-5D values (NICE,
2013).

The use of a single generic HRQoL instrument enables different health states, medical
conditions, and interventions to be compared. In the present study, EQ-5D-5L
responses were converted to utility values using the validated EuroQol 5L to
three-level (3L) mapping function (van Hout et al., 2012) and established U.K.
preference values (Dolan et al.,
1995), as recommended by NICE (2013). This enables comparisons to be
made between the present results and those of previous studies that used the
original EQ5D[3L] questionnaire. Population norm EQ-5D data for a representative
sample of 3,395 U.K. adults (Kind et al., 1999) has previously been developed using the same U.K.
preference values and the original three-level questionnaire (Dolan et al., 1995). The present mean EQ-5D
utility and VAS scores for U.K. adults with ADHD aged 18 to 55 years (0.74 and
69.81, respectively) are qualitatively lower than these U.K. population norms in
adults aged 18 years and over (0.86 [SD = 0.23] and 82.48
[SD = 16.96], respectively). Indeed, the present mean utilities
approximate to those reported in adults in the general population aged 75 years and
over (0.73 [SD = 0.27] and 73.66 [SD = 18.63],
respectively; Kind et al.,
1999) highlighting the burden of adult ADHD in this sample of U.K.
residents. These results are consistent with the findings of a study of 148
Norwegian adults aged 50 years and older diagnosed with ADHD in late adulthood, who
reported significantly worse HRQoL in every EQ-5D dimension compared with an age-
and gender-matched Danish population sample (Lensing et al., 2015).

The present EQ-5D scores are, however, numerically higher (indicating better HRQoL)
than those obtained using the U.K. preference values (Dolan et al., 1995) by Karlsdotter et al. (2016)
in a cross-sectional, observational study of 349 psychiatric outpatients with
DSM-5 adult ADHD (median age 33 years, 51.6% male) in several
European countries (mean EQ-5D utility and VAS scores of 0.609 [SD
= 0.33] and 62.0 [SD = 22.86], respectively), and by van Hout et al. (2012) for
a cohort of 69 U.K. patients with adult ADHD (mean age 34.3 years, 46% male) who
were part of the population used to develop the EuroQol mapping function (mean EQ-5D
utility and VAS scores of 0.59 [SD = 0.33] and 63
[SD = 21], respectively; van Hout et al., 2012). One explanation for
this difference may be that the present study excluded individuals with major mental
health disorders other than ADHD, whereas Karlsdotter et al. reported a high rate of
psychiatric comorbidities (88.5%), and van Hout et al. implemented a screening
question designed to filter out relatively healthy patients. A number of other
studies have observed that the negative impact of ADHD on HRQoL may be further
exacerbated by, or may increase the risk of, psychiatric comorbidities such as
anxiety and depression (Coghill,
Danckaerts, Sonuga-Barke, Sergeant, & ADHD European Guidelines Group,
2009; Danckaerts et
al., 2010; Kessler et
al., 2006).

As already mentioned, the use of a single, generic HRQoL instrument enables different
conditions to be compared. The present EQ-5D-derived mean utility and VAS values are
similar to the overall mean scores (0.73 and 68.54, respectively) self-reported by
patients with selected chronic conditions from National Health Service England’s
primary care Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) incentive program: asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, epilepsy, heart failure, and stroke (Peters et al., 2014). They
are also within the ranges reported in a systematic review of HRQoL in adults with
psoriasis (utility, .52 to .9; VAS score, 50.7 to 75.1; Moller, Erntoft, Vinding, & Jemec,
2015) but are higher than those reported for spinal complaints (mean utility
.39 [median .52]; McDonough et
al., 2005).

Greater impairments in HRQoL (i.e., lower EQ-5D utilities) were associated with
greater ADHD symptom severity; greater health-related impairments in work and
regular daily activities; not working; having chronic medical comorbidities; being
diagnosed by a psychiatry, psychology, or other service (vs. a primary care clinic
or pediatric service); older age at first or second diagnosis; lack of formal
qualifications; and older current age. After adjusting for gender and the presence
of chronic medical comorbidities, increasing age was associated with decreasing
utility and VAS score, which worsened by 0.05 and 1.77 points, respectively, for
each additional decade. Increasing age has also been found to be associated with
worsening EQ-5D scores in the U.K. population norms (Kind et al., 1999). In addition, telephone
interviews with a small sample (n = 24) of adults of mean age 66
years diagnosed with ADHD later in life indicated that impairments associated with
ADHD in the professional, economic, social, and emotional domains accumulated with
time (Brod, Schmitt, et al.,
2012). Together, these data indicate that HRQoL continues to decline with
increasing age in individuals with ADHD.

This study presents self-reported EQ-5D utilities for adult ADHD. As recently as
2014, no such data had been published, according to literature reviews (Matza et al., 2014; Van Brunt, Matza, Classi, &
Johnston, 2011), which led Matza et al. (2014) to develop three health
state descriptions for use in adult ADHD cost–utility models. The health states were
based on a literature review, clinician interviews, and clinical trial data; did not
include comorbid mental health disorders; and included a statement about whether a
(nonspecific) ADHD treatment was being received. Mean utility for these health
states, as rated by a sample of 158 U.K. adults from the general population using
time trade-off methodology, was worse for health states describing ADHD treatment
nonresponders (0.68 [SD = 0.28]) or untreated patients (0.67
[SD = 0.28]) than for the state describing treatment responders
(0.82 [SD = 0.17]) (Matza et al., 2014). Although the 2008 NICE
Guide to the methods of technology appraisal stated that the
methodology employed by Matza et al. is an acceptable way of generating EQ-5D
utility values when self-reported utility is unavailable (NICE, 2008b), this provision was removed in
the 2013 edition (NICE,
2013), making the present study even more relevant and timely.

The observed WPAI:GH mean impairments due to health problems of 45.65% in overall
work productivity and 45.79% in regular daily activities in adults with ADHD are
substantial and higher than those reported for type 2 diabetes mellitus (11.93% and
27.01%, respectively; Bays, Fox,
& Grandy, 2014). The present values, however, are lower than the mean
values observed by Able, Haynes,
and Hong (2014) in a web-based cross-sectional survey of adults from
Europe and the United States reporting an ADHD diagnosis (60.8% [SD
= 30.4] and 55.5% [SD = 27.0], respectively, in the U.K. subgroup
[n = 101]). A likely explanation could again be the high rate
of psychiatric comorbidities in the population recruited by Able et al., with 76.2%
of the U.K. subgroup reporting at least one of depression, anxiety/generalized
anxiety disorder, sleep difficulties/insomnia, and other anxiety disorders (Able et al., 2014). In
contrast, individuals reporting major psychiatric comorbidities were excluded from
the present study.

The results of this study indicated that greater symptom severity, as measured by
ADHD-RS-IV total score, was significantly associated with greater WPAI:GH
health-related impairments in regular daily activities (r = .256,
p < .001). This result complements findings from a smaller
U.S. study of individuals who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD in
adulthood and were receiving medication (n = 105), in which
significant associations between ADHD-RS-IV symptom severity and the work,
recreation, and interpersonal domains of the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool
(LIFE-RIFT) instrument were reported (Safren, Sprich, Cooper-Vince, Knouse, &
Lerner, 2010). In addition, each of the WPAI:GH work-related outcomes in
the present study was significantly independently associated with EQ-5D utility
quartile after adjusting for age, gender, and the presence of chronic medical
comorbidities. This indicates the importance of HRQoL to work and productivity and
also indicates that both are impaired in adults with ADHD.

Chronic medical comorbidities were reported by around 40% of participants in this
study (Table 2). The
most common was asthma, which was present in more than 20% of the study population,
higher than the estimated age-standardized point prevalence of clinician-diagnosed
asthma in the general U.K. population aged 16 years and above (~4%-12%), and the
lifetime prevalence of ~11% to 17% (Nwaru et al., 2015). This association of
asthma with ADHD is well established (Instanes, Klungsoyr, Halmoy, Fasmer, & Haavik,
2016) and is consistent with the findings of a large cross-sectional
Norwegian study (N = 1313), in which self-reported asthma
prevalence was significantly higher in adults with ADHD than in those without (24.4%
vs. 11.3%, odds ratio 2.53, 95% CI [1.88, 3.41]; Fasmer, Halmoy, Eagan, Oedegaard, & Haavik,
2011). Other chronic medical comorbidities reported by more than one
individual in the present study were rheumatoid arthritis (3.0% of participants),
diabetes (1.7%), and angina (1.3%), while 49 (21.0%) reported a chronic health
problem other than those listed in the questionnaire (Table 2). However, care should be taken in
extrapolating these results to the general U.K. adult ADHD population, as
individuals with psychiatric comorbidities were excluded from the present study. For
example, many medical comorbidities, including asthma and diabetes, are
significantly more prevalent in adults with ADHD and comorbid depression than in
those without depression, according to an analysis of U.S. employer-sponsored health
plan data (N = 29,965; Hodgkins, Montejano, Sasane, & Huse,
2011).

Key strengths of this study include the use of the generic EQ-5D HRQoL instrument
which enables comparison of health states across conditions and treatments, the fact
that EQ5D values for adult ADHD were self-reported rather than modeled, and the
inclusion of instruments that permit associations between HRQoL, health-related
impairments in work and regular daily activities, and symptom severity to be
investigated. In addition, the web-based survey format of the study enabled the
recruitment of a diverse population of U.K. residents with adult ADHD.

A number of caveats should, however, be considered when interpreting the present
data. First, the sample included 233 participants, fewer than the original target of
300. This level of recruitment allows for the identification of statistically
significant differences, at the 5% level, between two groups of participants of
equal size equivalent to a moderate effect size of ≈ 0.35 SDs
(Cohen, 1988). In the
whole sample, this provides a CI of maximum width ±5.5% around a percentage. The
lower level of recruitment was thus considered unlikely to impact the robustness of
the results. A second caveat of the study is a discrepancy over the age at which
symptoms began for some participants. For a diagnosis of adult ADHD,
DSM-5 requires that several inattentive and/or
hyperactive-impulsive symptoms be present before the age of 12 years (American Psychiatric Association,
2013), and at screening all 233 participants reported that symptoms had
been present since primary school (typically completed before 12 years of age in the
UK; Government Digital Service,
2017a, 2017b).
In the subsequent survey, however, 29 participants reported that symptoms began when
aged 13 to 17 years [n = 21, 9.0%] or at 18 years or over
(n = 8, 3.4%). Given the additional context about challenging
situations (which were aligned with the DSM-IV/5 items) during
screening, it might be likely that these participants did, in fact, experience ADHD
symptoms before the age of 12 years. This is consistent with research showing that
differences in context (Mathiowetz, 2000) and in wording or response format (Lee, Mathiowetz, & Tourangeau,
2007) can contribute to discrepancies in responses to disability
questionnaires. A third caveat of the study is that the sample is unlikely to be
fully representative of all U.K. residents with adult ADHD. For example, although
similar numbers of men and women accessed the initial screening form, more men
closed their web browser prematurely and more women completed the study. In
addition, the mean ADHD-RS-IV total score of 43.46 indicates that study participants
were toward the severe end of the ADHD symptom spectrum.

Finally, and most importantly, adult ADHD often coexists with psychiatric
comorbidities (Biederman,
Monuteaux, et al., 2006; Fayyad et al., 2007; Kessler et al., 2006) and the exclusion of
mental health illnesses other than ADHD limits direct extrapolation of the present
data to the wider adult ADHD population. On the contrary, this approach clarifies
the impact of ADHD on HRQoL independently from comorbid mental health disorders, in
keeping with European Medicines Agency guidelines stating that patients should not
be included in clinical trials for ADHD medications if they have severe comorbid
anxiety or depression, a primary DSM-IV Axis II disorder, or a
recently diagnosed comorbid Axis I disorder (European Medicines Agency, 2010).

In summary, the findings of this study isolate and highlight the substantial burden
of ADHD on the HRQoL and productivity of adults in the United Kingdom. For the first
time, EQ-5D utility is reported for adult ADHD without comorbid mental health
conditions and is demonstrated to be significantly associated with ADHD symptom
severity and to be significantly independently associated with WPAI:GH measures of
impairment to work and daily activities due to health problems after controlling for
age, gender, and chronic medical comorbidities. Given the burden of adult ADHD on
patients, their families, and society, physicians, and other stakeholders should
seek to implement treatment strategies that improve HRQoL and minimize the impact of
the disorder on work and daily activities, in addition to reducing ADHD
symptoms.
