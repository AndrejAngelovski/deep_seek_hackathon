published online 24 June 2020

Following publication of this article, the authors noticed an error in Fig. 6. In the original figure, the calculation of the positive symptoms score for the graph in panel B was different to the calculation described in the text, and the scale bar on the y-axis of the graph in panel B was incorrect. Additionally, the colours on the data points in Fig. 6B were unclear due to a production error. Figure 6 has now been replaced with a corrected version. The original, incorrect version of Fig. 6 is displayed below for reference.Fig. 6 .
