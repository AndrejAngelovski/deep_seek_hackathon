Correction to: Scientific Reports 10.1038/s41598-021-89166-8, published online 07 May 2021

The original version of this Article contained an error in the caption of vertical coordinate in Figure 4(b). As a result,

“Alpha diversity index (v)”

now reads:

“Relative abundance of Roseburia (v)”.

The original Figure 4 and accompanying legend appear below.Figure 4 Relative abundance of Roseburia in SZ patients showed strong negative correlations with ReHo indexes. (a) Cuneus_L showed significantly decreased ReHo indexes in SZ compared with the NCs (p < 0.05). (b) The residuals of the ReHo indexes in Cuneus_L were significantly negatively correlated with the residuals of the relative abundance of Roseburia in SZ. (c) Temporal_Sup_R showed significantly decreased ReHo indexes in SZ compared with the NCs (p < 0.05). (d) The residuals of the ReHo indexes in Temporal_Sup_R were significantly negatively correlated with the residuals of the relative abundance of Roseburia in SZ. (e) Temporal_Mid_R showed significantly decreased ReHo indexes in the SZ compared with the NCs (p < 0.05). (f) The residuals of ReHo indexes in Temporal_Mid_R were significantly negatively correlated with the residuals of the relative abundance of Roseburia in SZ. Sup: superior; Inf: inferior; L: left hemisphere; R: right hemisphere. **p < 0.05, FDR corrected, *p = 0.05, FDR corrected. Figure was generated by a brain network visualization tool of “BrainNet viewer” (Version 1.7, https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/), based on MATLAB (Version 2017a).

The original Article has been corrected.
