The use of internet videoconferencing in healthcare settings is widespread,
reflecting the normalisation of this mode of communication in society and
current healthcare policy. As the use of internet videoconferencing is
growing, increasing numbers of reviews of literature are published.

Methods
The authors conducted a review of the existing reviews of literature relating
to the use of internet videoconferencing for consultations between
healthcare professionals and patients with long-term conditions in their own
home. The review was followed with an assessment of United Kingdom National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for patient care in
the context of common long-term illnesses to examine where videoconferencing
could be implemented in line with these recommendations.

Results
The review of reviews found no formal evidence in favour of or against the
use of internet videoconferencing. Patients were satisfied with the use of
videoconferencing but there was limited evidence that it led to a change in
health outcomes. Evidence of healthcare professional satisfaction when using
this mode of communication with patients was limited. The review of
guidelines suggested a number of opportunities for adoption and expansion of
internet videoconferencing. Implementing videoconferencing in line with
current evidence for patient care could offer support and provide
information on using a communication channel that suits individual patient
needs and circumstances. The evidence base for videoconferencing is growing,
but there is still a lack of data relating to cost, ethics and safety.

Conclusions
While the current evidence base for internet videoconferencing is equivocal,
it is likely to change as more research is undertaken and evidence
published. With more videoconferencing services added in more contexts,
research needs to explore how internet videoconferencing can be implemented
in ways that it is valued by patients and clinicians, and how it can fit
within organisational and technical infrastructure of the healthcare
services.

==== Body
Introduction
The use of internet videoconferencing in healthcare settings is widespread,
particularly to support contact with patients in remote and rural areas across the
world.1,2 Previous studies
on the use of videoconferencing have reported increased benefits in patient care in
terms of reduced travel to hospital sites and convenience in consulting with
clinicians from the patients’ own homes,3,4 particularly for those with
long-term conditions.5–7 Increasingly,
policymakers in the United Kingdom (UK) and elsewhere, are encouraging the use of
internet videoconferencing with patients in routine healthcare settings,8 reflecting the normalisation of videoconferencing in society and current
policy.9,10 In the UK, the government has been investing in the
infrastructure for digital communication. The software has been rolled out to allow
Skype to be used safely and securely in the specialist clinical settings.11 However, there has been some concern that Skype may pose regulatory and
logistical challenges and may not be acceptable to patients and healthcare
professionals. In our recent LYNC study (Improving health outcomes for young
people with long-term conditions: The role of digital communication in current
and future patient-clinical communication), we researched early
adopters of other digital communication (such as email, text messages and mobile
phones) from 20 National Health System (NHS) specialist clinical teams from across
England and Wales and provided evidence on cost, patient safety, ethics and patient
experience.12,13 The LYNC study found that some clinicians were using Skype with
patients but were not prepared to openly admit it because of information governance
policies. To make evidence-based decisions, providers and policy makers need to know
about acceptability, feasibility and cost for patient and health system, and how
internet videoconferencing is best deployed alongside other forms of digital
communication. As the use of Skype and other forms of videoconferencing has grown in
recent years, many reviews of research evidence have been published to reflect this
rise. With the plethora of reviews available, it may be difficult to access the
appropriate evidence. Furthermore, where and how videoconferencing could be used in
consonance with current practice and guidelines for patient care has rarely been
explored.

Clinical pathways are tools used by health professionals to determine the best way to
manage specific medical conditions according to the best available evidence.14 The pathways map out, in chronological order, the key activities in a
healthcare process for specific patient populations.15 In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
produces guidelines for health, public health and social care practitioners.
Guidelines are published on the NICE website with the summarised evidence and
resources to help practitioners implement them. These guidelines are also included
in the NICE pathways, online tools that include up-to-date advice, quality standards
and related information, from preventing and managing specific conditions to
improving health and managing medicines in different healthcare settings. In recent
years, NICE has developed many new care pathways, including those for long-term
conditions. For example, the pathway for type 2 diabetes includes specific
guidelines on monitoring patient’s blood pressure and glucose, as well as on
identifying and managing complications and individualised care. As such, these tools
can be implemented to improve care delivery for patients. However, videoconferencing
pathways are not currently represented in these policy documents.

In this paper, we summarise the existing reviews of literature relating to the use of
internet videoconferencing. We follow this review with an assessment of NICE
pathways for common long-term conditions and identify where, from our interpretation
of these guidelines, internet videoconferencing could be an appropriate option for
healthcare delivery. Arguably, it may provide advantages to patients, their
clinicians and/or healthcare systems. Finally, we interpret the results from the
literature and NICE guidelines review in light of findings from the LYNC study,
examining how videoconferencing fits with the use of other digital communication
media.

Aims
The aims of this paper are: To summarise the existing reviews of literature relating to the use of
internet videoconferencing between patients with long-term conditions
and their treating clinicians from the patient’s own home (or mobile
device).

To review the NICE guidelines for long-term conditions (LYNC study
conditions: psychosis and schizophrenia, HIV, diabetes, liver fibrosis,
eczema, psoriasis, cancer, asthma, cystic fibrosis, arthritis, kidney
and sickle cell disease).

To identify where, in the patient pathway, the use of videoconferencing
might be possible and of advantage to the patient, their clinician
and/or the healthcare system.



The review of reviews
Methods
In collaboration with a trained information specialist (RC), a set of searches
was developed that aimed to capture reviews on the use of videoconferencing for
clinical communication. Firstly, using search terms ‘skype’ ‘videoconferenc*’
‘video-conferenc*’ ‘Google AND (talk or hangouts)’ in any field, we searched the
EndNote database of results from the review of systematic
reviews undertaken in 2014 as part of the LYNC study.13 This database included records from sensitive searches of
MEDLINE, Embase,
PsycINFO, Science Citation Index and
Social Science Citation Index, published from 2009 onwards.
We updated this search in MEDLINE in June 2017 using more
synonyms and brand names. We then undertook a further search combining thesaurus
and free-text terms for the concepts of ‘internet videoconferencing technology’
and ‘reviews’ in order to capture non-systematic literature reviews. Finally,
the results of an update scoping search for primary studies involving internet
videoconferencing, undertaken for the LYNC study, were also checked for
additional reviews. Details of the search strategies and sources used are
provided in supplementary file 1.

Results from the searches in 2014 were screened independently by one reviewer
(HA) who rated the eligibility of the records to confirm relevant papers.
Abstracts and full-text papers were then reviewed by two authors (HA and CJB) to
determine studies to be included for full review. From each included paper,
using a standardised form, two reviewers extracted information about (1) the
purpose of the study; (2) patients and participants; (3) the clinical
application area; (4) the study design; (5) the country, or countries, where the
study was conducted; and (6) whether the study findings supported the clinical
use of videoconferencing and Skype. The process was then repeated for papers
from the updated searches in 2017 by AI and CB.

This review included literature reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
Studies were included if they: (1) included reviews conducted in healthcare
settings where internet video use was with a patient in their own home or on a
mobile device; and (2) focused on patients with long-term illnesses. We included
English language articles only, and only those published since 2009. We excluded
reviews of reviews and those review articles that focused on patients with
multiple long-term illnesses.

The quality of each study was appraised by reviewers using the Assessment of
Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklists.16 Each checklist criterion was scored as 1 (checklist criterion satisfied);
or 0 (checklist criterion not satisfied, or unclear) yielding a quality score
across all criteria for each study in the range of 0 (worst) to 11 (best).
Reporting was guided, where applicable, by PRISMA guidelines.17 The data are presented as a narrative synthesis of the findings from the
identified reviews.

Results
A total of 489 relevant studies were identified in the searches, which included
several systematic reviews. After screening, a total of 149 abstracts were selected
for full-text review and 35 review articles were included in the review (Figure 1).

Review characteristics
The characteristics of the included reviews are summarised in Table 1. These covered a wide range of
long-term conditions, including: heart failure, depression, schizophrenia, stroke,
asthma, spinal cord injury, and chronic pain. Of 35 articles included in this
review, 25 were reviews or systematic reviews. Overall, eight looked at internet
videoconferencing exclusively,7,18–24 with the remainder examining a
range of telehealth interventions including videoconferencing. Only one review of
the clinical use of Skype was identified.7 Among the videoconferencing exclusive reviews, there were five that included
more than 25 studies in their review.7,18,21,25,26 In 24 of the included reviews,
forms of internet videoconferencing were compared with a face-to-face consultation
or usual care.

Overall, the methodological quality of included reviews was poor (Table 2). Only six reviews
were methodologically strong,7,22,26–29 with the remaining 31
obtaining a score of 6 or below, thus being of poor quality. The most common
methodological weaknesses were limited details of the included study
characteristics, such as clinical outcomes, participants’ demographics and potential
biases in the selection of articles. Within the included reviews, low and variable
uptake and the cost of establishing videoconferencing services across primary
studies were often identified as a limitation.

effectiveness and outcomes for specific patient groups and conditions, and on
patient satisfaction with this mode of communication. A total of six reviews found
evidence of patient satisfaction and equivalence with face-to-face encounters and
eight found improvement in at least one health outcome.

Table 3. Results of included reviews.

Author	Year	Results	
Armfield et al.7	2015	Patient outcomes: Skype allows good communication
between individuals and health professionals. Skype was more
economical than face-to-face appointments with savings accruing
from avoided travel.Health professional outcomes:
Skype provides adequate quality to facilitate a
diagnosis.Health service delivery outcomes:
Skype is adequate for patients across the age spectrum, though
more often for adult rather than for paediatric
applications.	
Backhaus et al.18	2012	Patient outcomes: Patients are satisfied with using
videoconferencing in order to discuss their mental health
conditions with a professional.Health service delivery
outcomes: This modality is promising and feasible for
those experiencing emotional disorders.	
Boisvert et al.68	2010	Health service delivery outcomes: This modality is
promising and feasible for patients with autism spectrum
conditions.	
Conway et al.28	2014	Patient outcomes: Structured telephone follow up
and telemonitoring reduced heart failure-related hospitalisation
admittances, but there was no conclusive evidence that this
occurred with videophone.	
De Weger et al.19	2012	Health service delivery outcomes: There is evidence
to suggest that improvements in depressive symptoms, medication
adherence, and remission rates do not differ greatly between
videoconferencing and face-to-face groups. Videoconferencing may
be more effective for anxiety-related disorders than for
depression.	
Dorstyn et al.30	2013a	Patient outcomes: Significant short-term
improvements were associated with internet-based modalities. The
evidence also indicates that in comparison with ‘information- or
monitoring-only control conditions’, telecounselling is
effective on its own. Limited data demonstrated longer-term
improvements. However, this modality’s absolute effectiveness
with in-person care is unknown.Health service delivery
outcomes: Telecounselling is flexible,
time-effective, and appeals to a variety of ages. It also
diversifies the treatments patients receive.	
Dorstyn et al.69	2013b	Patient outcomes: Telecounselling is promising for
improving patients’ physical (e.g. pain) and emotional (e.g.
depression) health in the short-term. The longer-term impact of
this modality is unknown.Health service delivery
outcomes: Telecounselling is time-efficient,
practical, and appealing to patients.	
Duncan et al.70	2014	Health service delivery outcomes: Telepsychological
assessment yields similar results as face-to-face encounters for
adult clients. Using videoconferencing to deliver psychotherapy
appears favourable for rural youth who lack access to
resources.	
Garcia-Lizana and Munoz-Mayorga31	2010a (online)	Patient outcomes: Patients are satisfied with using
videoconferencing technology. The limited data also suggests it
is effective for improving patients’ symptoms and adherence to
treatment. Telepsychiatry is also safe to use.Health
service delivery outcomes: There is evidence to
suggest that this modality improves service accessibility,
provides educational services to patients, and saves time and
money.	
Garcia-Lizana and Munoz-Mayorga32	2010b	Patient outcomes: Videoconsulting increased patient
satisfaction. The limited evidence suggests that this modality
could improve symptoms when face-to-face care is
unavailable.Health service delivery outcomes:
Studies demonstrate that outcomes for videoconsulting are
comparable with outcomes for the same therapy delivered in
person.	
Gloff et al.25	2015	Patient outcomes: Telemental health to reduce
disparities and to improve the quality of child and adolescent
mental healthcare.	
Hilty et al.26	2013	Patient outcomes: Face-to-face services may be
better for children and adolescents because of the novelty of
the interaction, the impact of technology on the young person’s
behaviour, the psychological and physical distance, and the
authenticity of the family interaction.Health service
delivery outcomes: Some studies reported reduced
length of hospitalisation, better medication adherence, symptom
reduction of disorders. Videoconferencing appears to be as
effective as in-person care for feasibility, outcomes, age, and
satisfaction with a single assessment and consultation or
follow-up use.	
Kasckow et al.45	2014	Patient outcomes: Telepsychiatry is promising and
has shown to improve clinical outcomes in areas such as
treatment adherence, symptoms, insight, perceived stress, and
social support.Health service delivery outcomes:
This modality is feasible, improves patient-staff communication,
and decreases hospitalisation rates and visits to the emergency
room. Limited data suggests that telepsychiatry is also
cost-effective.	
Kitamura et al.36	2010	Patient outcomes: Data suggests that
videoconferencing is feasible and effective for assessing,
monitoring, and managing patients with cancer. Patient
satisfaction was reported. However, the methodological quality
of the supporting evidence was generally weak and limited by
unmatched controls, small samples, and inappropriate
randomisation, making it difficult to ascertain the
effectiveness of videoconferencing in this
population.Health service delivery outcomes:
Evidence points towards reductions in healthcare expenditure and
travel/waiting times.	
Mars et al.39	2012	Patient outcomes: While patient satisfaction for
adjudicative competence has not been reported, there is evidence
that prisoners are satisfied ‘with the use of videoconferencing
for completing assessing tools’ (p. 245).Health
professional outcomes: Clinician satisfaction for
adjudicative competence has not been reported. Health
professionals are less satisfied with
videoconferencing.Health service delivery
outcomes: Telepsychiatry is cost-effective,
‘improve(s) access to scarce specialist skills and reduce(s)
transport of prisoners’ (p. 244). This modality also reduces the
risk of harm to clinicians by enabling them to assess prisoners
without entering a prison.	
Martin et al.40	2011	Patient outcomes: Patients expressed satisfaction
with using video conferencing. The data dealing with these
modalities appears more rigorous and reliable. While networked
technologies ‘offer patients a limited improvement in quality of
life, continuity of care and access […] these gains were matched
with concerns over privacy’ (p. e112).Health professional
outcomes: Health professionals felt satisfied with
using email and web-based technologies.Health service
delivery outcomes: Limited data on financial
implications makes it difficult to ascertain the
cost-effectiveness of networked technologies.	
McGeary et al.71	2013	Patient outcomes: Telehealth appears to produce
beneficial results for patients undergoing pain treatment, but
exact benefits are unknown. The evidence also indicates that
this modality reduces pain intensity.Health service
delivery outcomes: Limited data suggests that
telehealth is cost-effective.	
McLean et al.29	2010	Patient outcomes: Telehealth does not appear to
produce a desired impact on quality of life for those with mild
asthma. There is evidence of symptom improvement in telehealth
trial arms where symptoms are managed more rapidly than the
control arms.Health service delivery outcomes:
Telehealth improves access to healthcare services and may also
reduce costs and hospital admission rates, particularly for
those with more severe asthma who are managed in secondary
healthcare facilities.	
McLean et al.46	2011	Health service delivery outcomes: Web-based
clinical consultations, such as those for asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes annual reviews, can
replace routine visits such as face-to-face annual reviews.
Overall, the evidence for cost-effectiveness is limited.	
Nelson et al.20	2011	Patient outcomes: Videoconferencing is promising
concerning patient satisfaction.Health professional
outcomes: Studies examining therapeutic alliance have
not found significant differences between therapeutic alliance
developed in face-to-face and videoconferencing groups.
Telemental health assessments are reliable, feasible and
acceptable.Health service delivery outcomes:
Limited data suggests that videoconferencing is
cost-effective.	
Neubeck et al.48	2009	Patient outcomes: Telehealth produces beneficial
effects on reducing risk factors associated with coronary heart
disease.Health service delivery outcomes: The
scarce information provided by the reported trials on
cost-effectiveness and delivery costs meant that the authors
could not draw any conclusive statements.	
Paing et al.72	2009	Health service delivery outcomes: The limited data
indicates that telepsychiatry has the potential to be a useful
treatment alternative for patients.	
Peeters et al.47	2011	Health service delivery outcomes: The authors found
no evidence to suggest that administering video communication to
patients at home is cost-effective.	
Peterson73	2014	Patient outcomes: The limited data indicates that
mobile tools including video conferencing are a promising
modality in the management of patients’ glycaemic levels.	
Ramos-Rios et al.74	2012	Health service delivery outcomes: The use of
telepsychiatry, and specifically, videoconferencing in
psychogeriatric entails a number of challenges and a greater
complexity than in the case of its application with other
patients.	
Schlegl et al.41	2015	Patient outcomes: Technology-Based Interventions
including video conferencing may be beneficial for improving
symptoms (e.g. purging) as well as treating and preventing
eating disorders. This modality may also support carers looking
after those with eating problems. No serious adverse effects
were reported with using this modality.Health professional
outcomes: The limited data indicates that there are
differences between patients and therapists ‘in terms of
adherence to therapeutic tasks, adherence to therapeutic goals,
and therapeutic bond’ (p. 9).Health service delivery
outcomes: Limited evidence suggests that the costs
associated with telemedicine (including video) were lower,
albeit still considerable. Cost-effectiveness was comparable to
usual care.	
Sharp et al.21	2011	Patient outcomes: Videoconferencing is relatively
easy for patients with psychosis to use without exacerbating
their symptoms. In fact, there is some evidence to suggest that
the distance between patients and health professionals could
reduce anxiety and over-simulation.Health service delivery
outcomes: The data indicates a reduction in travel
time for patients and health professionals, decreased
hospitalisation rates, and an improvement in reaching those
living in rural communities. It appears that videoconferencing
produces more efficient healthcare.	
Shore34	2013	Health professional outcomes: Videoconferencing is
feasible and has gained popularity within psychiatry. It is
important that psychiatrists learn how to effectively implement
this technology and develop an understanding of the clinical,
regulatory, and administrative issues associated with it.
Psychiatrists should also generate an emergency protocol prior
to caring for patients via videoconferencing and, if necessary,
dialogue with them about their use or ownership of weapons
and/or (il)legal substances. The psychiatrist should also
reflect on their own communicative styles in order to ensure
that they interact naturally with the patient as they would
during face-to-face consultations.	
Simpson and Reid22	2014	Patient outcomes: Patients rated the therapeutic
alliance at least as high in the videoconferencing as in-person
therapy.Health professional outcomes:
Therapeutic alliance is high across diagnostic groups and
interventions, and therapist-rated alliance is moderate to high
in psychotherapy via videoconferencing.	
Siriwardena et al.35	2012	Patient outcomes: Telemedicine (including video) is
promising in the management of diabetes. Patients with
non-insulin type II diabetes reported better clinical outcomes
than insulin type I and type II patients. While two studies
revealed negative metabolic improvement, one demonstrated that
patients still found it helpful to contact their health
professional over the telephone. Overall, patient satisfaction
was high with telemedicine.Health service delivery
outcomes: The data suggests that financial benefits
are equal to usual care. This modality appears to reduce travel
and in-clinic waiting times.	
Slone et al.75	2012	Health service delivery outcomes: The evidentiary
support for telepsychology for children and adolescents is
encouraging but preliminary.	
Sucala et al.33	2012	Patient outcomes: Three of the review’s included
studies found that therapeutic alliance positively affected
treatment outcomes and in some cases, reduced anxiety-related
symptoms.Some studies also suggest that telemedicine
interventions may provide similar clinical outcomes to those
expected from in-person service deliveryHealth service
delivery outcomes: E-therapy (which includes video)
provides promising results for the delivery of mental health
services. This modality also appears equivalent to face-to-face
care in terms of therapeutic alliance, albeit the limited data
precludes any firm conclusions.	
Van Allen et al.23	2011	Patient outcomes: Young patients express
satisfaction with using videoconferencing.Health
professional outcomes: Some studies also suggest that
telemedicine interventions may provide similar clinical outcomes
to those expected from in-person service delivery.Health
service delivery outcomes: Telemedicine services for
children and adolescents with chronic illnesses are feasible and
cost-effective.	
Van den Berg et al.44	2012	Patient outcomes: Telemedicine (including video)
aids self-management and leads to better behavioural changes
(e.g. diet, exercise, self-efficacy) and quality of life.
However, some studies (26/68) excluded patients with cognitive,
visual, and auditory impairments, making it difficult to
generalise the findings of the review to these
sub-populations.Health service delivery
outcomes: This modality appears economically
beneficial in terms of reducing healthcare costs and
hospitalisation rates.	
Wile and Pringsheim24	2013	Patient outcomes: Telemedicine (including video)
and in-person care improved tic severity compared with baseline
measures for those living with Tourette’s Syndrome. No
conclusions could be made about the efficacy of each mode of
treatment delivery or equivalence ‘due to lack of inactive
control’ (p. 391).	
Zhai et al.27	2014	Patient outcomes: The authors observed a nominal
but statistically significant effect on decreased levels of
glycated haemoglobin for patients with type II diabetes
mellitus. While telemedicine (including video) appears promising
for the management of this condition, the authors detected a
high degree of publication bias.Health service delivery
outcomes: Due to small samples and heterogeneous
data, no conclusions about cost-effectiveness could be
drawn.	
Patient outcomes
A review of telecounselling for depression pooled results from 498 adults of
African-American, Spanish, and Asian origin and found some evidence of increased
satisfaction among individuals from ethnic minority communities. Limited data also
pointed towards longer-term health benefits for these patients.30 The review of telepsychiatry analysed results from a total of 1054 patients
from psychiatric services and concluded that telepsychiatry is safe to use. However,
there was insufficient evidence regarding its effectiveness in the routine
management of mental health patients.31 Furthermore, a review of videoconsulting for depression found it to be as
beneficial as in-person care.32

Overall, two reviews indicated that a good therapeutic alliance between clinician and
patient is possible via video,33,34 but no improvement in health
outcome was found in one of these reviews.33 There were two reviews that indicated that this modality may be better than
in-person care for some conditions, such as autism26 and anxiety-related disorders.19 This was often attributed to the difficulties and low motivation that can
sometimes accompany these conditions, and may hinder engagement with alternative
forms of intervention. The feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of
telemental health for children and adolescents have also been reported. Overall, two
reviews found that telemental health assessment with this group of patients was, in
general, reliable and feasible.20,23

In the review of the use of telemedicine in diabetes, 23 of the 27 randomised
controlled trials reported improved metabolic outcomes. In total, 12 of the 23
studies produced significant results, while only two observed negative health outcomes.35 Another review of 19 studies using videoconferencing in oncology found no
conclusive evidence of a difference between video consultation and face-to-face consultation.36 However, a review of telemedicine for asthma concluded that there was there
was a reduction in hospital admissions.37 Some reviews found differences
in outcome depending on the communication medium. For example, a review of
telemedicine for heart failure concluded that videophone did not improve outcomes
but structured telephone follow up and telemonitoring did, including all-cause mortality.28 In another review of the use of digital communication between clinicians and
young people requiring mental healthcare, 5 of the 12 studies concerned
videoconferencing, but significant improvement in health outcome was only seen with
email contact. However, the authors concluded that the evidence dealing with email
and web-based discussion was more reliable and rigorous than for videoconferencing.38

Only one review of the clinical use of Skype was identified.7 Arnfield and colleagues summarised evidence from the 27 published studies and
concluded that 26 of the 27 articles presented results that were supportive of
Skype. In particular, Skype was adequate for patients across the age spectrum,
although the majority of studies described applications involving adult patients.
Overall, five studies concluded that Skype offered good communication between
patients and clinicians. However, concerns about the security and privacy were
raised in the majority of the included papers.

Healthcare professional outcomes
Overall, four reviews considered the health professional perspective in more depth. A
review of forensic telepsychiatry in mental health reported that healthcare
professionals were less satisfied with using videoconferencing for the purpose of
assessment compared with the prisoners they were treating.39 This is acknowledged in another review that found professionals preferred
using email and other web-based approaches to videoconferencing when communicating
with young people with mental health disorders. Emails were viewed as beneficial to
therapy because written communication allowed clinicians to recount the young
person’s personal and health experiences.40 Schlegi and colleagues found that videoconferencing provides little benefit
for clinical staff in terms of cost or time savings, but may assist patients who
live in remote places to access specialist psychological service.41 Weger and colleagues concluded that the studies tend to highlight that health
professionals are more reluctant than the service users to use the technology.19

Health service outcomes
Health service delivery outcomes represented an outcome of interest in 30 reviews. In
the review on the use of telemental health, Hilty et al. reported reduced length of
hospitalisation and better medication adherence.26 Although the sub-analysis of a larger systematic review28 and meta-analysis into heart disease42,43 found that structured
telephone follow up and telemonitoring reduced heart failure-related hospitalisation
admittances, the authors found no conclusive evidence that this occurred with
videoconferencing. In another review on the use of telemedicine for older patients,
36 of the 50 studies (that included a medical endpoint) comprised various health
service outcomes (i.e. cost, hospitalisation, healthcare utilisation).44 The conclusion of the review was that video consultation may be an effective
method for decreasing healthcare expenditure. A review focused on telepsychiatry
reported that there were limited data in support of the cost-effectiveness of video technologies.45 Another review of internet videoconferencing for long-term conditions
reported similar findings about the evidence for cost-effectiveness.46 Armfield and colleagues reported that Skype was more economical than
face-to-face appointments with savings accruing from avoided travel,7 while the review of Peeter et al. of the financial benefits of
videoconferencing in comparison with usual care at home reported no advantages
compared with usual care.47 Taking into consideration the limited data surrounding the financial
implications of telemedicine, some reviews were unable to form any meaningful
conclusions about its cost-effectiveness.27,40,48

Summary of the findings
In the home setting, for patients with long-term conditions, the review of reviews
indicates that there is no formal evidence in favour of or against the use of
internet videoconferencing. Evidence for its impact on health outcomes suggests it
mostly has equivalence with face-to-face communication. The evidence for equivalence
seems to be the strongest in mental health conditions. Furthermore, internet
videoconferencing seems to be an acceptable mode of care delivery for patients with
long-term conditions. Research indicates that patients who have experienced
videoconferencing with clinicians, like it. However, there is limited evidence about
healthcare professionals’ satisfaction with this mode of communication. Little is
also known about the impact of videoconferencing on health service costs. The
discussion sections of most reviews often suggest that further research is needed
around cost, ethics and safety, and the practical challenges when implementing
internet videoconferencing. Finally, this review of reviews identified only one
review of the clinical use of Skype. Many of the reviews identified included
internet videoconferencing as one of a number of communication channels with the
patient, making it difficult to disentangle the actual impact of
videoconferencing.

In the remainder of this paper we explore where, in the patient pathway,
videoconferencing could be used to deliver healthcare and offer advantages to
patients, their clinicians and the healthcare system.

NICE pathways review
Methods
We undertook a review of NICE pathways for the diagnosis, treatment and
management of long-term conditions for children, young people and adults. We
chose to look at psychosis and schizophrenia, HIV, diabetes, liver fibrosis,
eczema, psoriasis, cystic fibrosis, cancer, asthma, arthritis, kidney and sickle
cell disease specifically as these were the conditions we researched in the LYNC
study project.

Using the online NICE guideline pathway tool (available at www.nice.org.uk/guidance/published?type=apg,csg,cg,mpg,ph,sg,sc),
we searched the guidance and advice list for the chosen conditions. For each
condition, two reviewers (clinician and researcher) read all the statements and
related quality standards, and noted whether videoconferencing could be used as
a mode of healthcare delivery during the implementation of the guidelines. This
involved going through the NICE interactive flowchart and examining all the
recommendations. Depending on the condition, the flowchart covered information
on preventing, detecting, diagnosing, monitoring and managing the long-term
conditions in primary, secondary and community care. It also included principles
of care and general statements about the quality of support provided to
patients. We then compared our findings to those of the review of reviews and
the LYNC study to further illustrate the practical applications of
videoconferencing in clinical practice.

Results
Our assessment of NICE pathways suggests that Skype and other forms of internet
videoconferencing could be used to review, monitor and plan care for patients with
long-term conditions (Table
4). In line with the current evidence and guidelines, internet
videoconferencing could be implemented to help clinicians support patients
through:

Table 4: Findings from the review of NICE guidance for chosen long-term
conditions.

Long-term condition	Summary of NICE guidance for clinicians	Opportunities to include videoconferencing as part of care	Benefits and challenges	Evidence from the review of reviews	Lessons from the LYNC study	
Psychosis and schizophrenia	Assessment in specialist mental health services:If
a clear diagnosis of psychosis cannot be made, monitor regularly
for further changes in symptoms and functioning.Care
planning in specialist mental health services: Agree
a suitable time to review the care plan.Support patients to
develop strategies, including risk- and self-management plans,
to promote and maintain independence and self-efficacy, wherever
possible.Communication and information:When
communicating with patients, use diverse media, including
letters, phone calls, emails or text messages, according to
their preference.	Monitoring, reviewing and support could be provided using Skype
and other forms of videoconferencing rather than
face-to-face.	Benefits for patients: reduced need to travel; saved time;
improved patient engagement and access to healthcare
services.Challenges: asynchronous modes of digital clinical
communication, such as text messaging, may be more appropriate;
ethical issues around privacy (in terms of information shared
and surroundings) and informed consent; issues around
reliability of the internet connection, payment for services,
cost to the patient and challenges surrounding information
governance.	Patients are satisfied with using videoconferencing in order to
discuss their mental health conditions with a
professional.18,31,45
Videoconferencing can be successfully used to provide
educational services to patients.31No loss of therapeutic alliance.20,22Evidence suggests that the distance between
patients and healthcare professionals could reduce anxiety and over-simulation.21	Asynchronous modes of digital clinical communication, such as
text messaging, may be more appropriate for providing support;
privacy and safety issues; possible increased dependence on the
clinician due to increased and easy access to information.	
Diabetes	Individualised care:Adopt an individualised
approach to diabetes care that is tailored to the needs and
circumstances of patients with type 2 diabetes, taking into
account their personal preferences, comorbidities, risks from
polypharmacy, and their ability to benefit from long-term
interventions.Patient education and lifestyle
advice:Offer patients with diabetes and their family
members or carers (as appropriate) a continuing programme of
education for diagnosis.Tailor the education programme to each
individual patient and their family members or carers (as
appropriate).Provide an alternative to the education programme
of equal standard for a person unable or unwilling to
participate in group education.	The programme of education could be delivered via Skype and
other forms of videoconferencing rather than face-to-face.	Benefits to patients: reduced need to travel; saved time; group
and individual educational programmes possible: overcoming
illness issues; improved patient engagement and access to
healthcare services.Challenges: training in technical use of
equipment may be best delivered face-to-face; ethical issues
around privacy (in terms of information shared and surroundings)
and informed consent; issues around reliability of the internet
connection, payment for services, cost to the patient and
challenges surrounding information governance.	Videoconferencing is a promising tool in the management of
patients’ glycaemic levels.73Patient satisfaction with videoconferencing is high.35This modality appears to reduce travel and in-clinic
waiting time.35	Digital clinical communication can be used to support patients
in maintaining good control of diabetes and prevent or delay
long-term complications. Asynchronous modes of digital clinical
communication, such as text messaging, may be more appropriate
for providing quick advice on changing dosages; possible
increased dependence on the clinician due to increased and easy
access to information.	
Dermatology: psoriasis, eczema	Principles of care:Offer people with any type of
psoriasis support and information tailored to suit their
individual needs and circumstances, in a range of different
formats, so they can confidently understand their diagnosis and
treatment options, how to use prescribed treatments safely and
effectively; when and how to seek further general or specialist
review; strategies to deal with the impact on their physical,
psychological and social
wellbeing.Assessments:Offer annual assessment for
psoriatic arthritis to people with any type of psoriasis.Discuss
risk factors for cardiovascular comorbidities with people who
have any type of psoriasis. Where appropriate, offer
preventative advice, healthy lifestyle information and support
for behavioural change tailored to meet the needs of the
individual.Topical therapy for psoriasis:Offer
practical support and advice about the use and application of
topical treatments. 	Assessment, support, advice and information could be provided
via Skype rather than face-to-face.	Benefits to patients:reduced need to travel; saved time;
possibility of regular reviews of the condition; improved
patient engagement and access to healthcare services.Benefits to
clinicians: saved time.Challenges:Safety issues around diagnosis
over video; ethical issues around privacy (in terms of
information shared and surroundings) and informed consent;
issues around reliability of the internet connection, payment
for services, cost to the patient and challenges surrounding
information governance.	No specific reviews published on videoconferencing and
dermatology since 2009.	Digital clinical communication can be used to monitor the
progression of the condition and alleviate psychological
distress; possible increased dependence on the clinician due to
increased and easy access to information.	
Cancer	Quality statements: Patients with cancer (and their
families and carers) should have their psychological and social
needs assessed at key points on their care pathway and receive
support based on their identified needs.Treatment, care and
support, and the information given about cancer, should be both
age-appropriate and culturally appropriate. It should also be
accessible to people with additional needs such as physical,
sensory or learning disabilities, and to people who do not speak
or read English.	Support and information could be provided via Skype rather than
face-to face.	Benefits to patients: reduced need to travel; saved time,
particularly when the condition is rare and the clinic far away
from the patient’s home; interpreter including signer for
hearing disabled could be involved remotely; group and
individual support possible; improved patient engagement and
access to healthcare services.Challenges: ethical issues around
privacy (in terms of information shared and surroundings) and
informed consent; issues around reliability of the internet
connection, payment for services, cost to the patient and
challenges surrounding information governance.	Evidence suggests videoconferencing is feasible and effective
for assessing, monitoring, and managing patients with cancer.36Patient satisfaction is high.36	Digital clinical communication can be used to enable patient
access to expert care and support alongside up-to-date
treatment. Asynchronous modes of digital clinical communication
may be more appropriate, particularly if the patient values
privacy and ability to contact the healthcare professionals
without having to wait until the next appointment; possible
increased dependence on the clinician due to increased and easy
access to information.	
Cystic fibrosis	Information and support:Provide people who are
newly diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and their family members or
carers (as appropriate) with opportunities to discuss their
concerns.Managing cystic fibrosis:Offer people
with cystic fibrosis a comprehensive annual
review.Preventing cross-infection:Inform people
with cystic fibrosis, their family members or carers (as
appropriate) and staff involved in their care about the risk of
cross-infection and how to avoid it.	Support and information could be provided via Skype rather than
face-to face.Reviews could be undertaken via Skype to avoid
cross-infection.	Benefits to patients: reduced need to travel; saved time;
possibility of regular reviews of the condition; improved
patient engagement and access to healthcare services.Challenges:
ethical issues around privacy (in terms of information shared
and surroundings) and informed consent; issues around
reliability of the internet connection, payment for services,
cost to the patient and challenges surrounding information
governance.	No specific reviews published on videoconferencing and cystic
fibrosis since 2009.	Digital clinical communication can be used to maintain health
status, prevent decline, and for peer support. Asynchronous
modes of digital clinical communication may be better used for
urgent matters; possible increased dependence on the clinician
due to increased and easy access to information.	
Arthritis	Education and self-management:People with
rheumatoid arthritis are offered educational and self-management
activities within 1 month of diagnosis. It is essential that the
offer of educational and self-management activities is not a
'one-off', but is repeated throughout the course of the disease
to ensure patients have the opportunity to participate at a
time, individual to them, that will support them to derive the
greatest benefit.Monitoring:Offer people with
satisfactorily controlled established arthritis review
appointments at a frequency and location suitable to their
needs.	Education could be offered via Skype rather than
face-to-face.Repeated appointments could be offered via Skype
rather than face-to-face.	Benefits to patients:reduced amount of travel, particularly if
mobility is an issue; saved time; improved patient engagement
and access to healthcare services.Challenges: ethical issues
around privacy (in terms of information shared and surroundings)
and informed consent; issues around reliability of the internet
connection, payment for services, cost to the patient and
challenges surrounding information governance.	No specific reviews published on videoconferencing and arthritis
since 2009.	This clinic did not use digital clinical communication at the
time of the study; possible increased dependence on the
clinician due to increased and easy access to information.	
NICE: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Advice and education: supporting patients in developing strategies to promote
and maintain independence and self-efficacy.

Information: signposting and providing patients with information about their
condition.

Relationships: enabling and helping to maintain better communication, and
supporting patient and their family’s psychological and social needs.

There is a range of clinical, supportive, educational and administrative functions
for which internet videoconferencing may be useful, from supporting care planning
and monitoring, organising follow-up consultations, reviewing or adjusting
medication to providing group or individual educational programmes for patients with
diabetes. The findings from our assessment suggest that videoconferencing would be a
particularly useful mode of communication when considering the NICE general
principles of care and quality statements underpinning clinical practice, most
notably, those around offering support and information on individual patient needs
and circumstances.

Videoconferencing could be implemented to meet patient need and preference at the
appropriate time and for specific reasons. Given that the main advantage of
videoconferencing is its convenience, the wider literature indicates that the
implementation of this method could potentially reduce barriers to treatment. For
example, patients may be able to save time travelling to the clinic and, in doing
so, avoid disruption to their daily activities. Patient education, either group or
individual, could be undertaken using internet videoconferencing. Studies that have
used videoconferencing for patient education report a number of advantages,
including patient satisfaction, improved health outcomes and overcoming mobility and
illness issues.49–51 Care planning,
reviews and monitoring, especially for those patients that have considerable
distances to travel for their appointments or are not well enough, could be assisted
using videoconferencing. Examples from our own LYNC research suggest that one of the
key benefits of digital clinical communication in comparison with face-to-face care
was that it improved access to health services and increased patient engagement.
Young people highlighted the role that digital clinical communication played in
saving them time, they did not have to fit around the operating times of the clinic
and were able to have a more frequent contact with their healthcare professionals.
Digital clinical communication was thought to help reduce the power imbalance in the
patient–clinician relationship, with clinicians fitting into the young person’s
world rather than the young person being expected to fit into the clinical world. As
a result, young people believed they had received a more personalised care tailored
to their own preferences and healthcare needs. Both patients and clinical team
members noted that this improved the relationship between patient and clinician, and
prompted better control of young peoples’ condition levels of self-care. A number of
issues contributed to this perceived improved personal relationship and
self-management: the ability to have more frequent contact with a specific clinician
who is known to the patient and likely to know that particular young patient’s
personal circumstances and what is important to them; the ability to have questions
or queries answered quickly and therefore take better control of the condition; and
the ability to communicate with clinical teams between appointments.

Overall, the review of NICE pathways points to a number of opportunities for adoption
or expansion of internet videoconferencing for patients with long-term conditions.
However, the opportunities to use this mode of communication and the actual benefits
derived from it are likely to depend on many factors. The focus on the patient
experience is important but this experience may vary substantially according to the
treatment pathway. Choosing to utilise internet videoconferencing may be influenced
by patients’ preference, their digital resources and skills, clinician’s motivation
to use it, the organisational and resource considerations, the healthcare setting
and the actual long-term condition. The LYNC study found that these factors were
likely to impact on the implementation of digital clinical communication, but could
be minimised if the clinician is clear on what they hope to achieve in terms of the
ability of the patient to manage their condition and health outcome. Furthermore,
adoption of internet videoconferencing is likely to vary based on factors such as
patient group or clinical setting. For example, communication problems in the
elderly patients, such as visual or hearing impairment, are likely to impact the use
of videoconferencing. In our study, the use of different modes of communication
varied across clinical teams and according to the reason for making contact. Digital
modes of communication also appeared to work best for patients and clinicians who
had pre-existing and established relationships.

Despite these insights, the use of videoconferencing in line with the current
guidelines for patient care may entail a number of challenges. Issues such as
reliability of the internet connection, privacy in terms of surrounding environment,
confidentiality of the information shared and informed consent, support for patients
and clinicians using the technology, cost to the patient, and challenges surrounding
information governance, compliance with legal and regulatory standards around
privacy and data protection are often mentioned in the literature, but rarely
explored in detail. The lack of data and the need to consider not only costs to
health services, but also costs to patients and their social networks, are often
highlighted as an important issue to explore.52 Furthermore, the use of videoconferencing raises a number of ethical
questions. In the LYNC study, young people had different understandings of
confidentiality and privacy than clinicians, and expressed different levels of
concern about possible breaches.53 Clinicians emphasised the importance of informing patients clearly about the
implications of using digital communication and seeking their consent prior to
commencing this service. However, they also expected that patients will take
responsibility for knowing the risks. There are inherent challenges around the roles
and responsibilities of clinicians when using videoconferencing for consultation
purposes. With a growing number of opportunities for adoption and expansion of
videoconferencing, further research exploring the actual implementation challenges
to inform and support the development of services is also needed. If internet
videoconferencing is to be used in line with the current guidelines for patient
care, the risks and benefits for different patient groups and healthcare settings
ought to be explored.54,55

Discussion
This review of reviews identified and synthesised a body of literature relating to
the use of internet videoconferencing between patients with long-term conditions and
their treating clinicians from the patient’s own home. The review indicated that
there was no formal evidence in favour of or against the use internet
videoconferencing. A total of 6 out of 35 review articles included in this review
concluded that patients were satisfied with the use of videoconferencing. However,
there was limited evidence that its use led to a change in health outcomes. In some
cases, it compared unfavourably with other methods of communication, such as web or
telephone-based communication. Evidence of healthcare professional satisfaction when
using this mode of communication with patients was limited. Little was also known
about the impact of videoconferencing on health service cost, ethics and patient
safety.

To our knowledge, this is the first review of reviews conducted in this topic area.
However, in comparing our findings with the systematic reviews of internet
videoconferencing in areas other than chronic conditions, it appears that some
findings are comparable. For instance, research has shown that such modes of
communication are acceptable to patients and effective for support after premature birth,56 follow up after total joint arthroplasty57,58 and care for paediatric
patients with various healthcare conditions.59 Good evidence from reviews also exists for other settings, some forms of
videoconferencing have been found to be feasible and acceptable for patients based
in hospitals, clinics or nursing homes.60 However, the reviews also highlight that despite a number of studies on
videoconferencing, high-quality evidence is only beginning to emerge. In this
review, we identified a considerable number of reviews that were of lower quality.
Limited details of included studies’ characteristics, potential biases in the
selection of articles and the methodological limitations of primary studies included
in the reviews are often cited as difficulties in bringing the conclusions together.
Many of the reviews in our review focused on various internet videoconferencing
modes and included them as one of a number of communication channels studied,
providing little evidence on the actual impact of videoconferencing. Publication
bias might also be a potential issue. Videoconferencing technology can often be
implemented and used in routine healthcare practice, but the evidence of its
acceptability and efficacy may not be published in academic literature. As such, and
despite a substantial increase in the number of published papers on
videoconferencing in the last few decades, further research on its deployment is
needed. Our review of reviews adds to the knowledge by summarising the extent,
range, and nature of findings of many separate reviews.

In the UK, there is a strong policy and political push towards the use of digital
technologies for clinician–patient communication to improve and transform care
models and patient pathways. Software has been rolled out to allow Skype to be used
safely and securely in the specialist clinical settings. The evidence base for the
clinical use of Skype is growing, our review of reviews concluded that Skype offered
good communication between patients and clinicians and was more economical than
face-to-face appointments with savings accruing from avoided travel. The review of
NICE pathways points to a number of opportunities for adoption and expansion of
Skype and other forms of videoconferencing for patients with long-term conditions.
However, as the review and the lessons from the LYNC project highlight, implementing
internet videoconferencing services poses a number of challenges. Past research
suggests, for example, that video consultations can be less reliable61,62 and less safe63 in comparison with face-to-face meetings. Issues of privacy, confidentiality
and informed consent, support for patients and their clinicians, and challenges
around information governance and compliance are often explored superficially. Very
few studies have looked at how they are interconnected and impact on implementing
the videoconferencing services.54,55 Internet videoconferencing for
patient–clinician consultations also requires some basic necessary technical
conditions to be in place, including basic technological infrastructure and
available technical support. Recent research shows that the quality of
videoconferencing can be affected due to failed calls and audio/video jitter.64 The evidence of the practical issues when introducing video consultations
from the UK is only beginning to emerge, suggesting that establishing such services
is complex because of disruption of routines in traditional clinic, and real and
perceived information governance issues (see, for example VOCAL study findings54). The introduction and implementation of videoconferencing services
inevitably changes the clinical and administrative ways of working. The lack of
training and support for clinicians and patients are often cited as barriers to the
use of videoconferencing.65,66

Furthermore, with non-secure modes of communication such as Skype, the challenges
surrounding information governance and compliance with legal and regulatory
standards around privacy and data protection have further implications for how the
communication is undertaken. There are inherent risks and ethical issues for
clinicians and patients, not least around finding appropriate physical space for the
video interaction and ensuring that that the technology works. The clinicians need
to be aware of the risks associated with use of non-secure modes and make best
efforts to minimise these risks, while also ensuring that the patient also
understands the risks of sharing information in this way.

Finally, the research on internet videoconferencing is rapidly changing, terminology
and modes of communication are becoming established and increasingly used in routine
practice. Studies that have examined longitudinal changes in content within the
internet videoconferencing literature show that publications on such modes of
communication have moved from technical aspects to focusing more on patients and
clinical applications.67 While current evidence base for the use of videoconferencing is equivocal, it
is likely to change as more research is undertaken and evidence published. With more
videoconferencing services added in more contexts, research needs to explore how
internet videoconferencing can be implemented in ways that it is valued by patients
and clinicians, and how it can fit within organisational and technical
infrastructure of the healthcare service.

Limitations of the study
Our review of reviews had some limitations. In order to retrieve a manageable
number of records with a high chance of relevance, search terms focused on the
specific technology of videoconferencing. More general terms, such as telehealth
and remote consultation, that may be used to describe the use of a wide range of
remote communication tools in this context, including videoconferencing,
telephone, email, etc. (and are therefore also likely to retrieve a large number
of irrelevant records), were not included. There is no guarantee that all
relevant systematic reviews were retrieved. However, the use of the MeSH term
‘videoconferencing’ in the search, which was first introduced to
MEDLINE in 2005, will have helped to retrieve some relevant
records that would otherwise have been missed. What is more, conducting a review
of existing reviews presents challenges in synthesising large amounts of
information. In this review, we aimed to summarise the existing literature,
while also taking into account the quality of each of the review. We are
conscious that summarising reviews can lead to a loss of information. For
example, a large number of the reviews in our review focused on various internet
videoconferencing modes. We did not differentiate between secure and non-secure
platforms when reporting our findings. Therefore, our results are only a
high-level summary.

In addition to our review of literature, this study examined the NICE guidelines
and identified where, in the patient pathway, the use of videoconferencing might
be possible and of advantage. However, the pathway review presented challenges
too. While the NICE pathways are generally considered a way of implementing
evidence-based guidelines into practice, they are recommendations and should be
used in conjunction with practitioner’s judgement and discussion with people
using services. Therefore, we recognise that we may not have been able to
summarise all the clinical functions for which internet videoconferencing may be
useful, at best, the review reflects the possible opportunities for adoption or
expansion of this mode of communication for patients with long-term
conditions.

Conclusions
The evidence base for the use of internet videoconferencing for consultation between
a healthcare professional and patient is growing, but there is still a lack of clear
evidence relating to the impact on outcomes and cost. While internet
videoconferencing appears to be feasible and acceptable to patients, there are
unanswered questions about the ethics of these consultations and the actual
implementation challenges.
