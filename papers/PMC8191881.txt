Background

Many medical disorders may contribute to adolescent psychoses. Although guidelines for thorough organicity investigations (OI) exist, their dissemination appears scarce in nonacademic healthcare facilities and some rare disorders remain undiagnosed, many of them presenting without easily recognized phenotypes. This study aims to understand the challenges underlying the implementation of OI in non-academic facilities by practitioners trained in expert centers.

Methods

Sixteen psychiatrists working at French non-academic facilities were interviewed about their use of OI for adolescents suspected of early psychosis. Interviews were analyzed with Grounded Theory.

Results

Organicity investigations were found to be useful in rationalizing psychiatric care for the young patient all the while building trust between the doctor and the patient’s parents. They also are reassuring for psychiatrists confronted with uncertainty about psychosis onset and the consequences of a psychiatric label. However, they commonly find themselves facing the challenges of implementation alone and thus enter a renunciation pathway: from idealistic missionaries, they become torn between their professional ethics and the non-academic work culture. Ultimately, they abandon the use of OI or delegate it to expert centers.

Conclusion

Specific hindrances to OI implementation must be addressed.

==== Body
Introduction

More than 60 diseases are known to increase the risk of psychotic disorders in childhood and adolescence; they include genetic syndromes, inborn errors of metabolism, and autoimmune, neurologic, endocrinological, and nutrition disorders [1–3]. As many as 12.5% of cases of childhood psychosis may have a medical (somatic) disorder contributing to the clinical presentation (ex: homocystinuria or intermittent porphyria) but their frequency in non-academic settings may be inferior given their more generalist patient recruitment [3]. The involvement of such a disorder should be considered when the following signs are present: visual hallucinations, confusion, catatonia, fluctuating symptoms and intellectual deficiency, as well as when the course appears abnormal (early onset, sudden onset, progressive cognitive decline, or treatment resistance) [4].

Although relevant guidelines for organicity investigations are available [1, 3, 5, 6], many of the disorders present without easily recognized phenotypes and are thus easily missed [7]. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure these diagnoses are made, because even if most of psychoses of organic origins remain inaccessible to specific treatment, some can benefit from suitable treatment and significant clinical improvement [8]. Diagnosing medical and genetic causes and risk factors of early psychosis is a challenge [3]. This challenge includes both training of psychiatrists and implementing organicity investigations throughout all psychiatric units. Eliminating the research-to-practice gap is a challenge of implementation science [9]. Eliminating the training-to-practice gap is another. Implementing changes in medical practice is a major matter that needs research. Collecting the professionals’ perspective on such matters is an important aspect of implementation research [10].

Community-based centers, nonacademic hospital departments of child psychiatry, and one-stop youth-friendly medical services offer generalist care for a broad range of disorders [11, 12]. On the contrary, “expert centers” are at the forefront of research on psychosis and provide complete psychiatric assessments, including thorough organicity investigations. Most of them are part of university hospitals.

How can organicity investigations provided in specialized expert centers be implemented effectively in nonacademic facilities? This study explores how practitioners trained in expert centers but working in nonacademic facilities use organicity investigations, including physical assessment and relevant laboratory workups, for their young patients with suspected early psychosis. We believe their personal perspectives will help identify the barriers to organicity investigations’ implementation and overcome them.

Material and methods

This qualitative research was conducted in compliance with the COREQ guidelines [13]. Participants were recruited via the mailing lists of three professional associations of psychiatrists working in the Paris region. The participants had training in organic causes of psychosis at expert centers but were currently working in nonacademic facilities in which they routinely treated adolescents and young adults. One-hour semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted by a male fourth-year resident in psychiatry (JLK) and took place in the participants’ office with no third-party present. They focused on their daily use of organicity investigations in their workplaces, their training and professional experience, the reactions of their colleagues, patients, and families to these organicity investigations, and their contacts with expert centers. The participants were not made aware of the interviewer’s objective and no relationship was established prior to the interview. The interviews were sound recorded, transcribed and analyzed with Grounded Theory [14], a standard methodology for social science research [15], which is particularly suited to understanding professional practices and organizational cultures. Grounded Theory links social structures with processes occurring at an individual level by focusing on themes that represent underlying interactions and their consequences [16]. The transcripts were not returned to the participants for comment or correction. As in other inductive methods, no exact number of respondents was required before the research began. The data were coded to generate categories, which were then validated through constant comparisons as new interviews were performed [17]. Thus, data analysis, further sampling, and theoretical development proceeded simultaneously until saturation was reached [14]. To ensure reliability, two researchers (JLK, LB (female; PhD) independently coded and analyzed all data and their findings were discussed during research team meetings, a process called triangulation [18]. No software was used during this process to manage the data. Consistency between the data and the findings was assessed by triangulation and participant feedback. No ethical approval was necessary since no patient data was used in this study. All participants gave informed consent.

Results

Sixteen psychiatrists (4 male and 12 female) aged 28 to 60 years (mean: 37; SD: 9,38) were selected through snowball sampling and all of them agreed to participate in the present study (see Table 1). Four were residents, six were fellows and seven were senior practitioners. Most participants (14/16) had subspecialized in child and adolescent psychiatry during their medical studies. Four participants provided direct feedback to the researchers and agreed with the findings. The results of the qualitative analysis are summarized in Fig 1. In this figure, major themes are presented with a blue background and minor themes with a withe background. For further details on the analysis, see S1 Table. Organicity investigations were found to be useful in rationalizing psychiatric care for the young patient all the while building trust between the doctor and the patient’s parents. However, in their quest for implementation, recently trained psychiatrist faced challenges that left neither their practice nor their new workplace unchanged.

A reassuring relational tool but a short-term avoidance of psychiatry

Advantages of organicity investigations

Organicity investigations were found to be a relational tool for families and a reassuring tool for doctors.

Psychiatrists viewed organicity investigations as a way to initiate the medical relationship with the patient’s parents whom they expected to be anxious about their first contact with psychiatry. They announced the carrying out of organicity investigations at the earliest opportunity to reassure them and to bespeak their expertise to the patient’s family. Besides, organicity investigations postponed facing the possibility of a psychiatric label and its social stigma, a possibility the doctors did not expect families to welcome.

When dealing with adolescents with early and unsettled symptoms, the concrete and scientific nature of organicity investigations helped in managing the medical uncertainty of “unclear, imprecise, invisible” psychiatry by providing a feeling of reassuring certainty of the absence of a somatic disorder. Once completed, they provided reliable results and legitimized a shift away from diagnosis and a focus on psychiatric care. Even though, as the saying goes, the absence of evidence isn’t the evidence of absence (these investigations only concern the somatic causes that we currently know about), they were therefore seen as a mandatory prerequisite to starting psychiatric care.

Limitations of organicity investigations

Organicity investigations are a pretext for short-term avoidance of psychiatry. Furthermore, they are unwelcomed for the patient and constraining for physicians.

The initial relief provided by the organicity investigations was short-lived, however, because in the end, parents mostly found their child diagnosed with an emerging mental illness. Inversely, the young patients were described as either indifferent or opposed to organicity investigations. Psychiatrists attributed this opposition to psychiatric symptoms (such as delusions) rather than any reasoned decision. There are therefore two relational drawbacks identified by the participants. The first was the fact that the avoidance of dealing with families’ worries about their child’s long-term mental health, future schooling and social integration was only slightly delayed. Secondly, they sometimes found that trying to convince their patient at any cost generated tension.

Lastly, organicity investigations were seen as constraining, given that they require clinical expertise to identify simultaneously atypical mental symptoms and signs of physical pathology. Participants found the identification of rare diseases a difficult body of knowledge to master and maintain; the skills they had acquired during their training in expert centers gradually fading. Furthermore, discouraging technical obstacles turned organicity investigations a meaningless and time-consuming procedure for psychiatrists working in nonacademic facilities.

To transform: Implementing organicity investigations as a recently trained psychiatrist

Young experts joining an aging institution

Young experts joining an aging institution feel the duty to implement medical progress within the psychiatry department and must disseminate the knowledge tactfully.

Recently trained participants considered themselves ethically bound to prescribe up-to-date medical investigations, such as organic and neurometabolic workups. The importance of organicity investigations seemed rooted in their belief that such investigations preserved their identity as medical doctors.

Given their background in expert centers and their senior colleagues’ lack of knowledge about organicity investigations, residents found themselves in the position of experts in their new workplace and considered it a duty to be a driving force for their implementation. Some described a messianic view of their role in transmitting expert center know-how. However, the specificity of organicity investigations, on the edge of medicine and psychiatry, sometimes generated disinterest or rejection which encouraged some participants to tread lightly and disseminate their knowledge tactfully. Attempts to implement organicity investigations, despite colleagues’ “somewhat hermetic attitude” sometimes resulted in a segmentation of care or a delegation to practitioners of other specialties or expert centers, and sometimes aggravated political tensions between hospital departments, with the refusal to change practices resulting from institutional disagreements.

Reshaping the use of organicity investigations

Faced with the constraints of their new workplace, participants either persevered in their use of organicity investigations, renounced, or settled for a pragmatic patchwork of tests.

Training in organicity investigations, however complete, did not appear to guarantee that the participants performed them in their nonacademic workplaces. None of the psychiatrists disputed the importance of organicity investigations in addressing emerging psychosis in adolescents. The constraints of their daily work reshaped their use, however:

The practices of some participants remained modeled on that of the expert center they had been trained at. They inflexibly ordered the same set of examinations, thus conforming to the primacy of evidence-based medicine over the work organization of their non-academic facility. Other participants explained that the lack of support from their colleagues had exhausted their initial enthusiasm and led them to gradually halt organicity investigations orders within a few months. Meanwhile, the rarity of conclusive evidence in daily practice confirmed their abandonment without systematically referring patients to an expert center. Lastly, some adopted a more pragmatic method by taking into account the financial constraints of nonacademic facilities and prioritizing less costly explorations. Similarly, local technical possibilities sometimes dictated which investigations were done. Although only partially satisfactory, such strategies allowed a pragmatic compromise between medical requirements and the reality on the ground.

Seeking external support

Our participants feel they need external support in order to refer patients, partner up for complex cases and get accurate somatic assessment. Those without a professional network experience loneliness.

The specific hindrances arising from the use of organicity investigations in non-academic workplaces and the reshaping it necessitates lead participants in a search for support and collaboration. For nonacademic psychiatrists, sharing common challenges with expert center colleagues enabled:

a collegial decision-making process about complex cases, therefore splitting the heavy medical responsibility of diagnosis and treatment choice.

mediation of the relationship with the patient and his or her family by providing external and expert validation of the proposed care, thereby strengthening the therapeutic alliance.

Despite their training, some participants perceived former expert center colleagues as more competent and consulted them in order to refer their patients. Nonetheless, due the prestige of expert centers, their relations with their former colleagues sometimes generated feelings of misunderstanding, harsh judgments, and lack of dialogue between these two distinct worlds.

Furthermore, the rarity and the diversity of diseases sought require a dialogue between psychiatrists and somatic specialists for accurate somatic assessment and optimal care. However, such cooperation was found to be difficult to establish. The psychiatrists’ enthusiasm for organicity investigations contrasted with the lack of commitment of the general practitioners working in nonacademic facilities. Therefore, participants were worried about the stigmatization of psychiatric patients would lead to less conscientious assessments.

Practitioners who did not have a wide professional network experienced difficulty in finding specialists with whom to share their uncertainties. Consequently, the autonomy granted to the trained psychiatrists gave them the freedom to practice as they saw fit but generated loneliness and isolation.

To be transformed: Changes in practices, as psychiatrists gain experience

The use of organicity investigations evolves across the recently trained psychiatrists’ working lives. Thus, we can sketch a typical career path that often leads to the abandonment of the practices recommended by the expert center they trained in because of the constraints of their work in nonacademic departments. Each of these stages will be described by the ideal type defined by Weber, the aim of which is to highlight the most significant traits to enable a better understanding of the social action involved [19].

The resident on a mission

Young residents, driven by their professional ethics, are keen to spread the use of organicity investigations.

Convinced by their teachers, young practitioners want to apply their expertise in their new environment. They feel they have a mission: to save their young patients long years of psychiatric care by diagnosing a curable disease. Accordingly, they are usually keen to spread this practice, they do not hesitate to manage complex clinical situations, or use their network in expert centers to seek help. In nonacademic settings where no protocol covers organicity investigations, professional ethics drive its pursuit.

The rise of an inner conflict

Over time, professional duties and local constraints generate doubt regarding the use of organicity investigations.

An intensive work rhythm puts daily pressure on the initial enthusiasm of these recently trained practitioners. They come to doubt the possibility of pursuing the use of organicity investigations as they learned it while fulfilling their responsibilities in their nonacademic setting. Aware of the inconsistency between the time-consuming use of organicity investigations and their department’s inaction in regard to organizational planning, they begin to advocate a systematization of practice by developing departmental protocols. A compromise solution is then adopted to apply organicity investigations routinely: they no longer try to clinically identify atypical symptoms that justify carrying out targeted complementary examinations, but rather automate the use of organicity investigations to facilitate it. These explorations are then chosen based on financial constraints and technical possibilities rather than on clinical relevance. Thus, prescribing organicity investigations turns into a meaningless routine.

Senior psychiatrists who give up organicity investigations

Ultimately, trained psychiatrists renounce the use of organicity investigations, but trust expert centers will go on.

Senior participants admitted that they were overwhelmed and “saddened” by the fact that their efforts at change had failed to move their teams out of the ’listlessness” of nonacademic departments. They now referred their patients to expert centers. Their awareness of their renunciation resonated as a painful disavowal of their former commitments and as a betrayal of their teachers.

Discussion

In this study, the obstacles to the implementation of organicity investigations came from the institution’s routine and overall inertia (leaving aside budgetary and technical problems). Psychiatrists and patients’ relatives find organicity investigations reassuring at a time when they are faced with the possibility of psychosis onset. In contrast, convincing the patient sometimes proved difficult, and psychiatrists tried to provide guidance and balanced information during these trying times [20]. Their goal was to avoid the entanglement of care and coercion which affects caregivers, the patients and their families [21, 22]. Their feeling of exigency to implement organicity investigations may also originate from the relatively high frequency of psychoses of organic origin in the expert centers they trained at. Nonetheless, the generalist care nonacademic facilities are assigned to perform, the high level of expertise required for organicity investigations, and the rarity of the diseases investigated ultimately led to unsatisfactory use of organicity investigations or systematic referral of patients to expert centers. The participants also felt isolated from the institutions they had trained in and ultimately lost contact with colleagues to consult when needed.

The science of implementation provides a relevant framework for the analysis of these findings and may help explain the gap between evidence-based practices and what is provided to consumers in routine care [9, 23–27]. Indeed, obstacles to change practices can arise at several levels in the healthcare system: the patient, the professional, team, organization, or environment. In the field of mental health, 15 to 20 years can separate the establishment of such practices and their widespread generalization, a gap that prevents patients from reaping the benefits of costly research [27].

Relational advantages of organicity investigations

Our results showed that organicity investigations were not only used as a technical medical tool but were especially considered as a way to manage the relationship and build trust with patients and their families. Indeed, despite the fact that these disorders are also associated with functional remission [28, 29], psychiatrists envision psychosis as a disastrous life-long disorder [30] and this viewpoint shapes their reluctance to disclose psychosis risks, a choice related to their belief in the self-fulfilling prophecy [31], and their knowledge of the stigma generated by a psychiatric label [32–35]. Organicity investigations thus convey a reassuring message: it may be possible to avoid psychiatric diagnosis and find a curable illness instead.

The prospect of early psychosis in a patient exposes practitioners to the uneasiness of medical uncertainty. Indeed, doctors face many uncertainties inherent in medical knowledge and are thus trained to remain in control in their daily practice [36, 37]. Psychiatry is especially subject to uncertainty because of its current technical and theoretical immaturity. The proper use of organicity investigations at the onset of psychosis is a good example: recommendations are fairly recent, not widely disseminated, and research is still embryonic. In completing academic courses in organicity investigations or training in expert centers, participants attempted to control medical uncertainty and as the same time used all of the latest medical tools available for their young patients’ care. They considered, as do we, that no distinction should be made between psychiatry and “somatic medicine”. Thus, organicity investigations are an integral part of a psychiatrist’s job.

Institutional obstacles for organicity investigations implementation

Our participants have experienced the difficulties of implementing alone a novel medical practice in a workplace with its own work culture and habits. Laypeople may think that medical knowledge and techniques are widely and rapidly adopted by the medical community when their superiority is established. This process is not nearly so straightforward, however. Behind the indisputable assertions of “finished science” lie many controversies and decisions not solely related to science. Studying science “in the making” makes it possible to pinpoint the moment when scientific discoveries might have gone in many other directions [38]. Indeed, this study depicts the intricacies of the adoption of organicity investigations: rivalries between departments and professionals, budgetary and technical criteria, as well as institutions’ desire (or lack thereof) for change.

This highlights the existence of segments in the medical profession [39]. Behind its apparent homogeneity lie many disparities—in values, interests, and methodologies—that segment it, creating opposing dynamic forces that can lead to institutional change. They also produce an informal division of labor, with each segment delegating work to another [40–42]. In our study, the segment of young experts urges the opposing segment—their nonacademic colleagues—to implement organicity investigations, with various outcomes. The multiplicity of parties involved in the decision-making process (psychiatrists, other specialists, administrators) and its centralized nature make any change long and its outcome uncertain. This “bureaucratic phenomenon”, characterized by its rigidity and inefficiency [43], becomes a source of tedious work (time-consuming paperwork and procedures) and frustration which clashes with participant’s professional ethics.

Furthermore, various characteristics of research evidence affect its usability in clinical practice. For instance, change is difficult if the innovation requires complex changes (in the decision-making process or the acquisition of new skills), better collaboration between disciplines, or changes in the organization of care. Adherence to new guidelines also depends on the type of health issue: it is better for acute than chronic care. All of these findings help explain the difficulty the participants have had in implementing organicity investigations in their nonacademic facilities: it concerns a chronic health issue and necessitates complex clinical evaluations and close collaboration between practitioners of different specialties. Targeted interventions (small group interactive training, feedback on performance, computer assistance), which have been shown to be the most effective way to transfer evidence into practice, might usefully be applied to improve the dissemination of organicity investigations [26].

Interactional obstacles for organicity investigations implementation

The newly trained participants are the only ones with strategic knowledge on organicity investigations, they are the necessary link between two systems that otherwise have trouble communicating: the expert center and the nonacademic department. It has however been shown that better collaboration and recognizing the “felt” power differential between institutions are essential to improve relations in trying times such as psychosis onset [44]. The newly trained participants therefore are at the center of a creative process that can lead to the adoption of organicity investigations. It is nonetheless a challenging position because they are not recognized as an integral part of either system, and they risk isolation when difficulties arise [45]. Interactions between the participants and their colleagues led to what A. Strauss calls “self-appraisals” and ultimately to the adoption of new ethics, or alternatively to the abandonment of old ones [46]. Furthermore, the lack of support from the organization’s leadership–experienced by some participants–is known to be a major barrier to implementation of new guidelines in routine practice [25].

According to Becker, medical trainees never lose their idealistic view of medicine; they simply adapt realistically to the situations they face during their training. By interacting with their peers and teachers, they become “pragmatically idealistic” [47]. We have shown this transformation by defining a “career path” in three characteristic stages, focusing not on who the participants are, but on what they are doing, and thus describing the social processes underlying their behavior [48, 49]. Indeed, daily interactions come into play over the years and lead young practitioners away from their mission by making them doubt the possibility of implementing organicity investigations in their nonacademic department. Ultimately, these processes can lead them to a heavyhearted abandonment or delegation of its use.

Conclusion

Implementing organicity investigations in nonacademic departments is not simply a matter of access to training in expert centers but necessitates facing relational, institutional and interactional challenges which involve facing the medical uncertainty inherent to psychosis onset and an extensive reorganization of care. Surprisingly, we also found organicity investigations to be a tool to build trust between physicians and the patients’ parents. Further research might be helpful in quantifying the current benefit for patient care in regard to the time and effort conceded by professionals. Tackling these challenges is nonetheless essential to guarantee the best care available to young patients, especially because expert centers cannot shoulder the burden of these investigations alone. To that end, we suggest the following measures:

10.1371/journal.pone.0252610.t002 Proposed initiatives to facilitate organicity investigations’ implementation in nonacademic departments:	
• Establish consensual international official guidelines for thorough medical assessment when childhood schizophrenia is suspected and enforce regular inspections of practices.
• Develop targeted interventions (small group interactive training, feedback on performance, computer assistance) in nonacademic departments.
• Develop the use of shared positions between nonacademic departments and expert centers for psychiatrists to ensure a long-lasting relationship between practitioners.
• Assign the “shared” psychiatrist mentioned above to be responsible for making referrals for complex cases to expert centers.
• Further develop joint research programs which could also improve dialogue between expert centers and nonacademic facilities.
• Sustained collaboration and training with somaticians (such as pediatricians, neurologists…) may improve the psychiatrists’ approach and knowledge of somatic diseases and strengthen the partnership in patient care

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: The authors were interested in a subject that has not yet been widely treated: the practical realization of organicity investigations (OI), particularly barriers and drivers to them, in adolescents with early psychoses treated in non-academic psychiatric centers, by interviewing French psychiatrists trained in expert centers about their practices.

The authors identified several advantages to this OI: facilitating the initiation of a trusting relationship (especially with the patients' relatives), having a "technical" tool to hold on to, corresponding to a certain professional identity (notably professional requirement and conscience), and disadvantages: complexity of the practical realization, negativity in the vast majority of cases leading to a psychiatric diagnosis of difficult acceptance, high level of competence required, difficulties in changing practices and a consequent feeling of isolation The authors pointed out the evolution of practices between the training received in expert centers ("the ideal") and the daily life then implemented by the practitioners ("the reality"), with a certain diversity of the professionals' paths (compromise between these 2 visions, abandonment...).

This research is very interesting because the subject is crucial given the potentially curable nature of certain diseases. The authors underline the extreme complexity of the subject given the absence of international consensual guidelines, the need for important competences and close links with paediatricians and expert centers given the large number of pathologies to be evoked, links that are not always well protocolized in practice. The discussion is well structured, and the authors propose measures to improve the situation as an opening remark.

There are no major problems in this very well-written and enjoyable article.

Some minor points:

- INTRODUCTION: Nuance the importance of recognizing psychoses of organic origin, most of which unfortunately remain inaccessible to specific treatment.

This point could also be addressed in the discussion, since there seems to be a discrepancy between the perception of the frequency of organically-induced psychoses accessible to treatment (and which should therefore not be "missed") and the statistical reality of these very rare situations, a discrepancy that may be accentuated by the expert centers, which themselves only (or almost only) see organically-induced psychoses. This is perhaps partly responsible for the feeling of exigency of the newly trained practitioners, and may give rise to a "messianic" vision of their work in non-academic centers.

- RESULTS. 1.1 Caution about the impression of reassurance induced by the "elimination" of any somatic cause. "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence".

- DISCUSSION: Clinical practice guidelines: consider a specific point concerning the improvement of collaboration with and training of potentially involved somaticians (pediatricians, general practitioners, neurologists, internists, etc.)

Reviewer #2: This is an interesting study that aimed to understand the challenges underlying the implementation of organicity investigations (OI) in non-academic facilities by practitioners trained in expert centers. I have the following comments:

It is stated that providing medical (somatic) disorders can lead to suitable treatment and significant clinical improvement [for psychosis]. What is the evidence for this? Considering how strong this premiss is, it is important to review the evidence in support for this claim.

It is suggested that organicity investigations in relation to psychosis diagnosis are already provided in specialized expert centres. It is important critically review how much these organicity investigations improve psychosis diagnosis and subsequent treatment outcomes in patients with psychoses.

It is equally important describe how much extract time and effort organicity investigations will require from both clinicians and patients. It they entail more additional time and effort for almost no improvement in diagnosis precision and treatment outcomes in patients with psychosis then they need for implementation non-academic facilities may be questioned.

When describing methods, it is stated that participants recruited in this study had training in organic causes of psychosis at expert centers but were currently working in non-academic facilities. Do the authors mean psychiatrists, trained psychologists or students? Please provide more detail on such an important aspect of the study.

The description of the sample in the results section is also necessary including mean and SD of age, gender distribution years of experience and level of educational attainment.

Also please explain what “youth psychiatrists” are. I assumed it was referring to psychiatrists who were young, but this may be incorrect interpretation.

It is quite misleading and factually inaccurate to say that psychosis as a disastrous life-long disorder. Over 60% of people with a diagnosis of psychosis fully recover within the first 2-5 years

The overall purpose of the study is not very clear. From the introduction it sounded like the aims of this work were to investigate how OI can be implemented in non-academic institutions. However, it appears that the actual aims were to identify personal perspectives of people with OI training on the benefits of OI and obstacles of their implementations. This disparity is rather confusing.

The conclusions in this work are based 0n personal opinions of 16 youth psychiatrists, who may be rather naïve or inexperienced to make rational recommendations. To make the conclusions stronger psychiatrists with more years of experiences need to be included in this study. Additionally, evidence from research studies, such as CRT, in support to the conclusions would be helpful.

Reviewer #3: Very useful article!

Althoug some wording revision should be applied:

page 3, last sentence. replace semicolons by commas.

Page 4: first sentence: Sixteen "youth" psychiatrists aged 28 to 60. I suggest to remove the word "youth" given the fact that the age range goes far beyong youth.

Page 7: from third line: very long sentence. Try to improve wording by separating sentences.

Page 8: "The practices of some participants remained modeled on that of the expert center they had [been]

trained at." The verb on the sentence was missing.

Page 9: wording suggestions: "Therefore, participants [were]worried [about] the

stigmatization of psychiatric patients would lead to less conscientious assessments"

Figure 1: I don't fully grasp the difference between the second ("to transform") and the third ("to be transformed") categories. I suggest to choose other words to highlight the core ideas

Response to reviewers – Implementing organicity investigations in early psychosis: Spreading expertise

Dear editorial team, Dear reviewers,

It is with great pleasure that we submit for your consideration our revised manuscript. After careful examination of each point raised by the academic editor and the reviewers, the necessary changes have been made and are highlighted in the file, as requested.

The term “youth psychiatrist”, used in our article to designate psychiatrists specialized in adolescents’ and young adults’ mental health, has been found to be confusing and unclear. This issue has been addressed by further detailing the participants’ status and specialty as well as their work settings.

Following is a detailed list of the changes made to comply to the journal requirements:

1. The manuscript now meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming, as detailed in the formatting guidelines.

2. There are no ethical or legal restrictions on sharing de-identified data. Therefore, you will find in “S1_File” the minimal anonymized data set necessary to replicate the study findings

3. The “ethics” statement has been moved to the required location and the “competing interest” statement has been removed from the manuscript

4. Figure 1 has been uploaded in the manuscript. It can be found at the beginning of the Result section

5. Captions for the Supporting Information file has been included at the end of the manuscript and the in-text citation has been updated to match accordingly

Response to Reviewer 1 :

• INTRODUCTION: Nuance the importance of recognizing psychoses of organic origin, most of which unfortunately remain inaccessible to specific treatment.

This point could also be addressed in the discussion, since there seems to be a discrepancy between the perception of the frequency of organically-induced psychoses accessible to treatment (and which should therefore not be "missed") and the statistical reality of these very rare situations, a discrepancy that may be accentuated by the expert centers, which themselves only (or almost only) see organically-induced psychoses. This is perhaps partly responsible for the feeling of exigency of the newly trained practitioners, and may give rise to a "messianic" vision of their work in non-academic centers.

• We agree with the reviewer and have modified the manuscript as follows:

“As many as 12.5% of cases of childhood psychosis may have a medical (somatic) disorder contributing to the clinical presentation (ex: homocystinuria or intermittent porphyria) but their frequency in non-academic settings may be inferior given their more generalist patient recruitment (1).” And “Nevertheless, it is important to ensure these diagnoses are made, because even if most of psychoses of organic origins remain inaccessible to specific treatment, some can benefit from suitable treatment and significant clinical improvement (2).” And in the Discussion section: “Their messianic enthusiasm to implement organicity investigations may also originate from the relatively high frequency of psychoses of organic origin in the expert centers they trained at.”

• RESULTS. 1.1 Caution about the impression of reassurance induced by the "elimination" of any somatic cause. "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence".

• We thank the reviewer for this comment and for providing us this adage which highlights the subjective nature of the reassuring feeling provided by organicity investigations. We have taken the liberty to insert it as is in the manuscript:

“(…) the concrete and scientific nature of organicity investigations helped in managing the medical uncertainty of “unclear, imprecise, invisible” psychiatry by providing a feeling of reassuring certainty of the absence of a somatic disorder. Once completed, they provided reliable results and legitimized a shift away from diagnosis and a focus on psychiatric care. Even though, as the saying goes, the absence of evidence isn’t the evidence of absence (these investigations only concern the somatic causes that we currently know about), they were therefore seen as a mandatory prerequisite to starting psychiatric care.”

• DISCUSSION: Clinical practice guidelines: consider a specific point concerning the improvement of collaboration with and training of potentially involved somaticians (pediatricians, general practitioners, neurologists, internists, etc.)

• We agree with the reviewer and have added a specific point in the manuscript:

“Sustained collaboration and training with somaticians (such as pediatricians, neurologists…) may improve the psychiatrists’ approach and knowledge of somatic diseases and strengthen the partnership in patient care”. Following the comment of Reviewer 2, the “Clinical Practice Guidelines” have been retitled “Proposed initiatives to facilitate organicity investigations’ implementation in nonacademic departments”.

Response to Reviewer 2 :

• It is stated that providing medical (somatic) disorders can lead to suitable treatment and significant clinical improvement [for psychosis]. What is the evidence for this? Considering how strong this premiss is, it is important to review the evidence in support for this claim.

• We agree with the reviewer and have added a citation to back the statement that suitable treatment can lead to clinical improvement for psychosis of organic origins. (Merritt J, Tanguturi Y, Fuchs C, Cundiff AW. Medical Etiologies of Secondary Psychosis in Children and Adolescents. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America. 2020 Jan 1;29(1):29–42).

• It is suggested that organicity investigations in relation to psychosis diagnosis are already provided in specialized expert centres. It is important critically review how much these organicity investigations improve psychosis diagnosis and subsequent treatment outcomes in patients with psychoses.

• We agree with the reviewer and have specified which citation illustrates the impact of organicity investigations on psychosis diagnosis and treatment (Giannitelli, M., Consoli, A., Raffin, M., Jardri, R., Levinson, D. F., Cohen, D., & Laurent-Levinson, C. (2018). An overview of medical risk factors for childhood psychosis: Implications for research and treatment. Schizophrenia Research, 192, 39–49. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2017.05.011)

• It is equally important describe how much extract time and effort organicity investigations will require from both clinicians and patients. It they entail more additional time and effort for almost no improvement in diagnosis precision and treatment outcomes in patients with psychosis then they need for implementation non-academic facilities may be questioned.

• We agree with the reviewer that the improvement in diagnosis and treatment has yet to be compared to the extra time and effort put into their carrying out in nonacademic settings. We have not found studies addressing this topic and this was one of our main motivation for conducting this research. However, our data suggests that the effort and time needed is currently perceived as a significant obstacle to sustained use of organicity investigations (cf. “Reshaping the use of organicity investigations” in the Results section). This limitation was highlighted in the Conclusion: “Further research might be helpful in quantifying the current benefit for patient care in regards to the time and effort conceded by professionals.”

• When describing methods, it is stated that participants recruited in this study had training in organic causes of psychosis at expert centers but were currently working in non-academic facilities. Do the authors mean psychiatrists, trained psychologists or students? Please provide more detail on such an important aspect of the study.

The description of the sample in the results section is also necessary including mean and SD of age, gender distribution years of experience and level of educational attainment.

• We thank the reviewer for this comment and have provided the required information: “Sixteen youth psychiatrists (4 male and 12 female) aged 28 to 60 years (mean: 37 ; SD : 9,38) and working in a variety of settings, were selected through snowball sampling and all of them agreed to participate in the present study (see Table 1). Four were residents, six were fellows and seven were senior practitioners.”

The type of education attainment regarding organicity investigations is listed for each participant in Fig. 1: “Residency in EC”, “Fellowship in EC” and “Academic courses”.

• Also please explain what “youth psychiatrists” are. I assumed it was referring to psychiatrists who were young, but this may be incorrect interpretation.

• We thank the reviewer for giving us the opportunity to clarify this point: the term “youth psychiatrist” has been removed as it seemed to be confusing. We have addressed this issue by specifying the participants’ work setting as well as their professional status and level of specialization: “The participants had training in organic causes of psychosis at expert centers but were currently working in nonacademic facilities in which they routinely treated adolescents and young adults. (…) The majority of participants (14/16) had subspecialized in child and adolescent psychiatry during their medical studies. »

• It is quite misleading and factually inaccurate to say that psychosis as a disastrous life-long disorder. Over 60% of people with a diagnosis of psychosis fully recover within the first 2-5 years

• We agree with the reviewer regarding the recovery of people with a diagnosis of psychosis. The identification of psychosis as a “life-long disaster” by psychiatrists originates from a qualitative study addressing the psychiatrists’ representation and attitude towards psychosis risk management

To highlight the discrepancy between these representations and the reality of the evolution of such disorders, we have modified the manuscript as follows : “Indeed, despite the fact that these disorders are also associated with functional remission (25,26), psychiatrists envision psychosis as a disastrous life-long disorder (27) and this viewpoint shapes their reluctance to disclose psychosis risks, a choice related to their belief in the self-fulfilling prophecy (28), and their knowledge of the stigma generated by a psychiatric label (29–32). »

• The overall purpose of the study is not very clear. From the introduction it sounded like the aims of this work were to investigate how OI can be implemented in non-academic institutions. However, it appears that the actual aims were to identify personal perspectives of people with OI training on the benefits of OI and obstacles of their implementations. This disparity is rather confusing.

• We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify the aim of our study. The overall aim of this study was to enquire to the professionals “on the field” about their usage of organicity investigations to determine the barriers to their implementation. In the framework of implementation science, the evidence-based practice is distinguished from its implementation process and the professionals’ perspectives play an important role. (Bauer, M.S., Damschroder, L., Hagedorn, H. et al. An introduction to implementation science for the non-specialist. BMC Psychol 3, 32 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-015-0089-9). To clarify the interconnexion between the professionals’ perspective and the implementation of organicity investigations, we have modified the Manuscript as follows : “Implementing changes in medical practice is a major matter that needs research. Collecting the professionals’ perspective on such matters is an important aspect of implementation research (10). (…) This study explores how practitioners trained in expert centers but working in nonacademic facilities use organicity investigations, including physical assessment and relevant laboratory workups, for their young patients with suspected early psychosis. We believe their personal perspectives will help identify the barriers to organicity investigations’ implementation and eliminate them.”

To further highlight this, we have also changed the title of our table in the Conclusion: “Proposed initiatives to facilitate organicity investigations’ implementation in nonacademic departments”.

• The conclusions in this work are based 0n personal opinions of 16 youth psychiatrists, who may be rather naïve or inexperienced to make rational recommendations. To make the conclusions stronger psychiatrists with more years of experiences need to be included in this study. Additionally, evidence from research studies, such as CRT, in support to the conclusions would be helpful.

• We thank the reviewer for this comment. We believe our answers to the previous questions and subsequent Manuscript modifications address these issues.

We agree with the reviewer regarding the usefulness of CRT in preventing relapse and improving cognitive efficacy in patients’ daily lives. (Mueller, D., & Roder, V. (2017). 101. Does Cognitive Remediation Therapy Prevent Relapses in Stabilized Schizophrenia Outpatients? A 1-Year RCT Follow-Up Study. Schizophrenia Bulletin, 43(Suppl 1), S53–S54. https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbx021.139 ; Amado, I., Moualla, M., Jouve, J., Brénugat-Herné, L., Attali, D., Willard, D., ... & Yannick, M. (2020). Employment, Studies and Feelings: Two to Nine Years After a Personalized Program of Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatric Patients. Frontiers in Psychiatry, 11, 609 ; O’Reilly, K., Donohoe, G., O’Sullivan, D. et al. A randomized controlled trial of cognitive remediation for a national cohort of forensic patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. BMC Psychiatry 19, 27 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-019-2018-6). However, as stated earlier, the aim of our study wasn’t to provide guidelines to improve the care of patients with psychosis, and therefore, we have not discussed the efficacy of psychological or psychosocial interventions.

Response to Reviewer 3 :

• page 3, last sentence. replace semicolons by commas:

• We agree with the reviewer and have modified the manuscript as follows: “They focused on their daily use of organicity investigations in their workplaces, their training and professional experience, the reactions of their colleagues, patients, and families to these organicity investigations, and their contacts with expert centers.”

• Page 4: first sentence: Sixteen "youth" psychiatrists aged 28 to 60. I suggest to remove the word "youth" given the fact that the age range goes far beyong youth.

• We thank the reviewer for this comment which has allowed us to clarify this issue. I refer you to the answer made to Reviewer 2 on this subject.

• Page 7: from third line: very long sentence. Try to improve wording by separating sentences.

• We agree with the reviewer and have modified the manuscript as follows: “There are therefore two relational drawbacks identified by the participants. The first was the fact that the avoidance of dealing with families’ worries about their child's long-term mental health, future schooling and social integration was only slightly delayed. Secondly, they sometimes found that trying to convince their patient at any cost generated tension.”

• Page 8: "The practices of some participants remained modeled on that of the expert center they had [been] trained at." The verb on the sentence was missing.

• We agree with the reviewer and have modified the manuscript as follows: “The practices of some participants remained modeled on that of the expert center they had been trained at.”

• Page 9: wording suggestions: "Therefore, participants [were]worried [about] the

stigmatization of psychiatric patients would lead to less conscientious assessments"

• We agree with the reviewer and have modified the manuscript as follows: “Therefore, participants were worried about the stigmatization of psychiatric patients would lead to less conscientious assessments.”

• Figure 1: I don't fully grasp the difference between the second ("to transform") and the third ("to be transformed") categories. I suggest to choose other words to highlight the core ideas

Thank you for your continued interest of this submission. I look forward to your reply.
