Question
Do baseline and longitudinal cognitive architecture discriminate healthy controls from
subgroups of young individuals at risk for psychosis?

Findings
This multiple-group design study involving 384 healthy controls and 173 individuals at
ultrahigh risk for psychosis found that baseline cognitive architecture differentiated
healthy controls from converters and nonremitters. Remitters were found to recover their
cognitive deficits over time, but nonremitters did not.

Meaning
Cognitive deficits appear to identify the individuals most likely to develop psychosis
and appear to reflect an underlying deterioration of a person’s clinical condition
over time.

Importance
Cognitive deficits are a key feature of risk for psychosis. Longitudinal changes in
cognitive architecture may be associated with the social and occupational functioning in
young people.

Objectives
To examine longitudinal profiles of cognition in individuals at ultrahigh risk (UHR)
for psychosis, compared with healthy controls, and to investigate the association of
cognition with functioning.

Design, Setting, and Participants
This study has a multiple-group prospective design completed in 24 months and was
conducted from January 1, 2009, to November 11, 2012, as part of the Longitudinal Youth
at-Risk Study conducted in Singapore. Participants either were recruited from
psychiatric outpatient clinics, educational institutions, and community mental health
agencies or self-referred. Follow-up assessments were performed every 6 months for 2
years or until conversion to psychosis. Individuals with medical causes for psychosis,
current illicit substance use, or color blindness were excluded. Data analysis was
conducted from June 2014 to May 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures
Neuropsychological, perceptual, and social cognitive tasks; semi-structured interviews,
and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders were
administered every 6 months. The UHR status of nonconverters, converters, remitters, and
nonremitters was monitored. Cognitive domain scores and functioning were investigated
longitudinally.

Results
In total, 384 healthy controls and 173 UHR individuals between ages 14 and 29 years
were evaluated prospectively. Of the 384 healthy controls, 153 (39.8%) were female and
231 (60.2%) were male with a mean (SD) age of 21.69 (3.26) years. Of the 173
individuals at UHR for psychosis, 56 (32.4%) were female and 117 (67.6%) were male with
a mean (SD) age of 21.27 (3.52) years). After 24 months of follow-up, 383 healthy
controls (99.7%) and 122 individuals at UHR for psychosis (70.5%) remained. Baseline
cognitive deficits were associated with psychosis conversion later (mean odds ratio
[OR], 1.66; combined 95% CI, 1.08-2.83; P = .04) and
nonremission of UHR status (mean OR, 1.67; combined 95% CI, 1.09-2.95;
P = .04). Five cognitive components—social
cognition, attention, verbal fluency, general cognitive function, and
perception—were obtained from principal components analysis. Longitudinal
component structure change was observed in general cognitive function (maximum vertical
deviation = 0.59; χ2 = 8.03;
P = .01). Group-by-time interaction on general cognitive
function (F = 12.23;
η2 = 0.047; P < .001) and
perception (F = 8.33;
η2 = 0.032; P < .001) was
present. Changes in attention (F = 5.65;
η2 = 0.013; P = .02) and
general cognitive function (F = 7.18;
η2 = 0.014; P = .01) accounted
for longitudinal changes in social and occupational functioning.

Conclusions and Relevance
Individuals in this study who met the UHR criteria appeared to demonstrate cognitive
deficits, and those whose UHR status remitted were seen to recover cognitively.
Cognition appeared as poor in nonremitters and appeared to be associated with poor
functional outcome. This study suggests that cognitive dimensions are sensitive to the
identification of young individuals at risk for psychosis and to the longitudinal course
of those at highest risk.

This longitudinal cohort study examines the trajectory of cognitive impairment in people
younger than 30 years who are at the highest risk for developing psychosis.
==== Body
Introduction
Individuals who are prodromal to schizophrenia have a higher risk for and transition rate
to psychosis compared with the general population.1,2,3,4,5,6,7
Cognitive deficits are also a predictor associated with psychosis.3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27
Cognitive impairments are the core disabling factors in psychosis and
schizophrenia.28,29,30,31 Meta-analytic
evidence indicates that cognitive deficits are present in individuals at ultrahigh risk
(UHR) for psychosis.24,25,26,32,33,34
There is a 35% likelihood that the presence of symptoms—functional or cognitive
manifestations—in high-risk, care-seeking individuals predates psychosis.6 However, systematic evidence is scarce
for longitudinal cognitive trajectories in individuals at UHR for psychosis. Recent reports
confirm that cognitive deficits at baseline are associated with conversion to psychosis, but
the reports have not addressed the longitudinal cognitive profiles of these
individuals.27 Equivocal
evidence ranges from modest improvements in cognition in converters and first episode
psychosis26 to suggestions
that cognitive decline may be a strong factor in eventual psychosis.33,35,36 Previous reports
indicate that approximately 50% of individuals at UHR for psychosis improve spontaneously
within a short follow-up time frame.37

Longitudinal schizophrenia cognitive studies may offer insights to UHR cognitive
trajectories. Premorbid cognitive deficits were found to be associated with
schizophrenia.33,38,39,40 Cognitive impairment
can be observed also in nonpsychotic family members of psychotic patients.41,42 Progressive changes in cognition over a 30-year period were reported in
children who later developed schizophrenia.33 Two aspects of cognitive trajectories may be investigated: (1)
means-based change, where differential time-based cognitive changes may exist between
healthy individuals and those at UHR for psychosis, and (2) covariance-based change. The
latter involves changes in the cognitive component structure, as defined by cognitive tests,
over time43,44 and is known as the cognitive dedifferentiation
hypothesis. This dedifferentiation is associated with poorer cognitive function with
increased covariation across cognitive tests, a phenomenon previously observed in aging
research.43,44 Intriguingly, forms of cognitive dedifferentiation
were also noted in schizophrenia,45,46 where a subtle
increase in test covariation was previously reported.47,48

We studied the prospective cognitive trajectories of individuals at UHR for psychosis. We
expected to observe the greatest decline in cognitive performance over time among
individuals at UHR who converted to psychosis compared with nonconverters and healthy
controls. In individuals whose UHR status did not remit during the follow-up period, we
expected to observe declining cognitive performance compared with remitters and healthy
controls. We hypothesized that increased test covariance would be present as a function of
time for individuals whose UHR status did not remit over time. Finally, we examined how
changes in cognition as a function of time affected the social and occupational functioning
of individuals at UHR for psychosis.

Methods
Ethics approval for this study was provided by the Singapore National Healthcare Group's
Domain Specific Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants,
and consent from a legally acceptable representative was obtained for minors (younger than
21 years) as required by local regulations. This study was conducted from January 1, 2009,
to November 11, 2012. Data analysis was conducted from June 2014 to May 2018.

Participants
This study, as part of the Longitudinal Youth at-Risk Study conducted in
Singapore,49 included 384
healthy controls and 173 individuals who met the criteria for UHR for psychosis.12 After 24 months, 383 healthy
controls (99.7%) and 122 individuals at UHR for psychosis (70.5%) had remained in the
study. Participants either were recruited from psychiatric outpatient clinics, educational
institutes, and community mental health agencies or were self-referred. Individuals with
neurological causes for psychosis, current illicit substance use, or color blindness were
excluded. All participants were between 14 and 29 years of age. Their UHR status was
ascertained by the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States,12 and their psychiatric history was
evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I
Disorders.50 Healthy
controls did not fulfill UHR criteria, had no psychiatric disorder, and had no family
history of psychosis.

Follow-up assessments at 6-month intervals for 2 years or until conversion to psychosis
included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,51 Beck Anxiety Inventory,52 Calgary Depression Scale for
Schizophrenia,53 and the
Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale.54 Remission status was assessed at the 12- and
24-month time points. Individuals at UHR for psychosis were categorized into converters or
nonconverters and remitters or nonremitters. Individuals at UHR at baseline but who no
longer fulfilled UHR criteria at the 24-month time point were categorized as remitters.
Those who met UHR criteria at final assessment or had converted to psychosis were
categorized as nonremitters. In subsequent analyses, 2 sets of analysis were carried out
involving (1) healthy controls, converters, and nonconverters and (2) healthy controls,
remitters, and nonremitters. Details of the sampling methodology and the demographic
characteristics of the sample were reported elsewhere.49,55

Cognitive Measures
The Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span56; the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia,57 which consists of verbal memory,
digit sequencing, token motor task, verbal fluency, symbol coding, and Tower of London
tests; the Binocular Depth Inversion task58,59; the Continuous
Performance Test—Identical Pairs60; the High-Risk Social Challenge skills interview61; the Babble task62; and the Snakes in the Grass
test63 were administered.
Cognitive tests were adjusted for age, sex, age × sex, age,2 and age2 × sex via linear regression modeling,64 and standardized residual scores were used for
subsequent analysis. Cognitive scores were standardized against healthy control baseline
measures. (See the Supplement for eAppendixes 1 and 2 [with eFigure 1], which deal with the concept
of testing factor structure changes, and eAppendix 3 for data preprocessing details.)

Statistical Analysis
Ordinal logistic regression was conducted to examine between-groups baseline cognitive
differences. Univariate models that were P < .05 were
selected for subsequent analysis. Linear mixed models were carried out to examine
cognitive changes, allowing the inclusion of all longitudinal data available for each
participant and the examination of the association of maturational stage with age-related
trajectory changes over time. Stuart-Maxwell Marginal Homogeneity test was used to examine
the divergence of the estimated test score distributions between the baseline and the
24-month follow-up for each group; these distributions were Bonferroni corrected. A
principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted on baseline and 24-month cognitive
batteries to investigate the cognitive component structure changes. Component loading
vectors were compared via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (see eAppendixes 1 and 2 in the
Supplement), and
the comparisons were Bonferroni corrected. Cognitive components scores were compared using
1-way and repeated measures analysis of variance to examine group-by-time interactions.
Repeated-measures general linear models were used to investigate the association of
cognitive component changes with the rate of functioning changes. Bonferroni corrections
for all intergroup comparisons were completed; further details of the data analysis are
reported in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement. Analyses were conducted using SPSS, version
22.0 (IBM), unless otherwise noted.

Results
Demographics
Prospectively we evaluated 384 healthy controls (of whom 153 [39.8%] were female and 231
[60.2%] were male with a mean [SD] age of 21.69 [3.26] years) and 173 individuals at
UHR for psychosis (of whom 56 [32.4%] were female and 117 [67.6%] were male with a mean
[SD] age of 21.27 [3.52] years) who were between 14 and 29 years of age. Individuals
at UHR for psychosis were further studied according to their conversion status (17
converters, of whom 3 [17.6%] were female with a mean [SD] age of 20.41 [3.18]
years; 156 nonconverters, of whom 53 [34.4%] were female with a mean [SD] age of 21.37
[3.55] years) and remission status (84 remitters, of whom 28 [33.3%] were female with a
mean [SD] age of 21.15 [3.41] years; 89 nonremitters, of whom 28 [31.5%] were
female with a mean [SD] age of 21.38 [3.64] years). Further demographic
characteristics are reported in the Table.

a Converters are also part of the nonremitters.

No statistically significant differences in sex proportions were found across healthy
controls, nonconverters, and converters
(χ21 = 3.74; P = .05)
as well as healthy controls, remitters, and nonremitters
(χ21 = 3.74; P = .05).
No statistically significant differences in age were observed among healthy controls,
nonconverters, and converters (F = 1.53;
P = .22) and healthy controls, remitters, and nonremitters
(F = 1.02; P = .36).
Statistically significant higher Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State scores
were observed in individuals at UHR for psychosis compared with healthy controls
(F = 766.74; P < .001;
η2 = 0.581). No notable differences were observed in the
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, and Beck
Anxiety Inventory measures across groups (Table).

Baseline Group Differences: Ordinal Logistic Regression
Baseline cognitive profiles of all tests are reported in eFigure 2 in the Supplement.
Statistically significant between-group differences were found in verbal memory, digit
sequencing, token motor task, verbal fluency, symbol coding, and Tower of London tests;
the Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span; the High-Risk Social Challenge skills
interview; the Snakes in the Grass test, and the Continuous Performance
Test—Identical Pairs across groups (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Post hoc
independent, unpaired, 2-tailed t tests revealed differences among
healthy controls, nonconverters; healthy controls, converters; and healthy controls,
nonremitters (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Baseline cognitive deficits were associated
with psychosis conversion (mean odds ratio [OR], 1.66; combined 95% CI, 1.08-2.83;
P = .04) and nonremission of UHR status (mean OR, 1.67; combined 95%
CI, 1.09-2.95; P = .04).

Cognitive Changes: Linear Mixed Models
Verbal memory, digit sequencing, token motor task, and symbol coding tests; the High-Risk
Social Challenge skills interview; the Snakes in the Grass test; and the Continuous
Performance Test—Identical Pairs showed longitudinal changes across all groups.
Nonlinear changes in cognitive trajectories were also found (Figure 1; eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Group-level differences were expected, but few group-by-time interactions were observed
across cognitive tests (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The distributions of cognitive linear mixed
models estimated scores were different at baseline and 24-month follow-up for all groups
(eTable 6 in the Supplement). Increasing effect sizes across groups suggested that cognitive
trajectories in nonremitters and converters were most divergent, pointing to subtle
underlying perturbations of test covariation. Maturation stage (median split of age at
baseline) and age-related trajectory changes were unremarkable. Statistically significant
model changes were mostly due to the variability within the clinical groups rather than by
observed group differentials (eFigures 3-9 and eTables 3-5 in the Supplement).

Psychometric Architecture of Cognitive Constructs: Principal Components
Analysis
Twenty cognitive subtests with nominally significant
(P < .05) baseline group differences were selected for
PCA. Five orthogonal principal components were extracted using the Kaiser
criterion65 (λ >1).
Social cognition, attention, verbal fluency, general cognitive function (GCF), and
perception were the 5 principal components that explained variances of 63.3% (healthy
control), 74.1% (remitter), and 71.2% (nonremitter) at baseline and variances of 62.8%
(healthy control), 75.7% (remitter), and 84.4% (nonremitter) at 24-month follow-up. The
reliability of cognitive measures was comparable at baseline (overall α = .831;
healthy control α = .792; remitter α = .845; nonremitter α
= .809) and at 24-month follow-up (overall α = .848; healthy control
α = .818; remitter α = .863; nonremitter α = .900).
Component loadings by group and follow-up are represented in Figure 2.

Component load differences in GCF were noted among healthy controls, remitters, and
nonremitters. Stark differences in component load between GCF baseline and 24-month
follow-up in nonremitters were observed. Longitudinal changes for the component loadings
for GCF in nonremitters were also observed (maximum vertical deviation = 0.59;
χ2 = 8.03; P = .01). The
observation is supported by results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests that examined
component load vectors across the PCA output (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Different
load profiles were present among healthy controls, remitters, and nonremitters at baseline
and at 24-month follow-up for the perception component, where subtler trends in social
cognition load changes appeared in nonremitters but failed to survive the Bonferroni
correction (eTable 7 in the Supplement).

Longitudinal Change in Cognitive Constructs
Weighted and nonweighted cognitive component scores were computed on the basis of the PCA
results (eAppendix 3 in the Supplement). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was
conducted on the cognitive component scores. Bonferroni-corrected α level of .025 was
used to handle 2 test sets that evaluated the same hypothesis. Longitudinal changes were
found for attention, GCF, and perception (Figure
3; eTable 8 in the Supplement). Post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted paired sample
2-tailed t tests showed improved performance in remitters, which
accounted for the overall model effects. In nonweighted component scores, only GCF was
found to be significant. Between-participant analysis of variance tests at both baseline
and follow-up further confirmed that, although remitters appeared more similar to
nonremitters at baseline for social cognition, attention, and GCF, their performance
improved spontaneously with time, and remitters were more similar to healthy controls at
24-month follow-up (Figure 3; eTable 8 in
the Supplement).

Relation to Functioning
There was a main association of time with the range of social and occupational
functioning at baseline and 24-month follow-up (Figure 4; eTable 9 in the Supplement). A statistically significant group-by-time
interaction was observed, suggesting differential rates of change of functioning among
healthy controls, remitters, and nonremitters. Group-by-time interaction on GCF
(F = 12.23; η2 = 0.047;
P < .001) and perception
(F = 8.33; η2 = 0.032;
P < .001) was present. Change in attention and GCF
components appeared to partially mediate change in functioning (eTable 9 in the Supplement). Post hoc
models revealed that change in the attention component
(F = 5.65; η2 = 0.013;
P = .02) partially mediated the spontaneous improvements in
functioning in remitters and nonremitters compared with healthy controls (Figure 3E and Figure 4C and D). Change in GCF
(F = 7.18; η2 = 0.014;
P = .01) fully accounted for a differential rate of change
in functioning between remitters and nonremitters. All post hoc comparisons survived
Bonferroni correction.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the largest prospective single-site report of a
case-control sample of individuals at UHR for psychosis. Comparisons between remitters and
nonremitters suggested that above baseline cognition, trajectory and component-based
analyses can identify psychosis and nonremission from illness. Worsening cognitive function
over time may be a prime factor in eventual, if not incipient, psychosis.33,36,66,67

Baseline Differences and Prediction Models
The study results are consistent with literature that shows significant cognitive
deficits in UHR samples. Participants at UHR for psychosis were differentiated from
healthy controls, and converters were differentiated from nonconverters according to
baseline cognitive performance. Cognitive modeling results demonstrated statistically
significant differences not only among healthy controls, converters, and nonconverters but
also between individuals who met UHR criteria at baseline and those whose UHR status
remitted, compared with those who had no remission.

Prospective Trajectory Changes
Longitudinal modeling of cognitive performance revealed that most individuals improved
with repeated testing every 6 months in the 24-month follow-up. Statistically significant
group differences in trajectories were observed, suggesting that baseline variations in
cognitive performance interact differently with time in the different groups. These
results were consistent with earlier reports indicating that some individuals at UHR for
psychosis display cognitive improvements with time.67 Practice effects, pharmacological effects, and
diagnostic heterogeneity67 were
alternative explanations for the phenomenon, but the more fine-grained follow-up
neuropsychological test data reported here may offer further clarification of the
cognitive trajectories of individuals at UHR for psychosis. Gradual increases in
variability of test performance over time suggest the possibility that the underlying
cognitive architecture may have devolved in converters and nonremitters during follow-up.
Thus, measures of dedifferentiation of cognitive components may be 1 of the most powerful
factors in later conversion and nonremission in individuals at risk for psychosis.
Additional analysis of the maturational stage indicated that, between age 14 and 29 years,
the most cognitive trajectory changes could be associated with clinical outcomes.
Improvement of cognitive performance over time seems to be associated with age, but
differential age-related cognitive trajectories do not appear to be present in groups at
UHR for psychosis. Nevertheless, larger samples and wider age ranges might be required to
further examine differential maturational profiles.

Cognitive Architecture and Shifts in Component Loadings on Test Performance
Instead of maximizing the separation of cognitive components, we extracted them
orthogonally to make apparent the cross-loading of cognitive subtests. Comparing PCA
loading vectors revealed a significant shift in loading patterns between baseline and
follow-up in nonremitters, implying the subtle changes in cognitive architecture over
time. To our knowledge, such architectural changes have not been reported in previous
studies of individuals at UHR for psychosis. We postulate that examining the prospective
differential contribution of cognitive components to test performance could reveal subtle
cognitive changes in at-risk states that will help differentiate between remitters and
nonremitters. Covariance strength across cognitive test performance has been shown to
yield vital insights into brain function in aging research43,44,68 and to be a property of deficit
cognition in schizophrenia.45,47,48 Decreasing differentiation of GCF, perception, and social cognition
components over time among nonremitters and converters is apparent.

Investigating Cognitive Constructs
Cognitive components weighted by differential component loadings revealed more
sensitivity with social and occupational functioning, particularly with the attention and
GCF components. These findings indicate that incorporating cognitive architecture changes
appears to be essential in uncovering subtle but important cognitive fluctuations that are
relevant to functioning. Neither perception nor social cognition contributes to the
variance in functional change beyond the traditional neuropsychological constructs. The
trend related to the lack of clear group separation within the perception component could
be attributed to the psychometrics of contributing tests. The Snakes in the Grass test, a
visual search paradigm, may reflect the subtler changes in lower-level cognitive processes
rather than the more robust separation in more traditional neuropsychological tasks.
Nevertheless, the contribution of the perception component to test covariance supports the
evidence that more refined cognitive mechanisms continue to be sensitive measures in
identifying UHR for psychosis in general.69,70,71,72
Social cognition was the only construct that showed decrement over time in nonremitters
beyond the baseline differences between healthy controls and remitters, although the
component loading analysis suggested only trend-level dedifferentiation. It confirms that
these findings replicate the notion that social cognition is separable from cognition even
among individuals at UHR for psychosis.73,74,75 Longer follow-up periods might be necessary to
determine whether an association between functioning and social cognition might emerge,
similar to those in schizophrenia, as the downward trajectory in nonremitters
ensues.76,77 Although speculative, mathematical models of
cognitive architecture might be more sensitive than the standard neuropsychological tests
to the changing neurobiology associated with emerging psychosis in young people at
risk.

Cognition improved as a function of time, but the changes in remitters were dramatic.
Remitters started at baseline with cognitive profiles that were similar to those of
nonremitters, but their performance at follow-up was not different from that of healthy
controls. The model that best exemplified this phenomenon included the measures comprising
GCF. The correspondent longitudinal transition from dedifferentiation to differentiation
of GCF that accounted for the functional recovery in remitters illuminates opportunities
for follow-up work.

Overall, the results point to the possibility that UHR may not be a stable clinical or
cognitive construct and that the deficits observed are transient. Results indicate that
cognitive deficits in nonremitters tend to be stable and impaired in nearly all
components. Longitudinal changes in cognitive architecture, particularly in remitters,
have an association with the social and occupational functioning in young people. The
converse could be true as the cognitive architecture continues to be increasingly
dedifferentiated in nonremitters. These findings suggest that the prognosis for
nonremitters is poor and will require the most clinical attention and remediation in the
long term.

Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the conversion rate is low. Of the 173
participants at UHR for psychosis followed-up during a 2-year period, 17 (9.8%) converted
to psychosis, which is a lower rate than most other reported conversion rates. We
speculate that the reason may be the strict drug laws in Singapore and the structured
nature of its society. Low conversion rate precluded more sophisticated analysis on
convertors. Second, medication use was not systematically adjusted for in the current
analysis. The individuals at UHR for psychosis were not medicated with antipsychotics,
although some were taking antidepressants. The association of antidepressants with
cognition was found to be weak,78,79 but no differences
in anxiety or depressive symptoms among UHR groups were observed. Subsequent studies of
psychotropic medications and their various cognitive outcomes in at-risk mental states may
be informative. Third, the subsampling between nonremitters and converters presented a
challenge. Because of the limited sample sizes, we chose to use 2 analysis subsets,
comparing healthy controls with remitters and nonremitters as well as healthy controls
with nonconverters and converters. It would be ideal to classify samples as healthy
controls, remitters, nonremitters, and converters, which is a necessary consideration for
subsequent studies with larger sample sizes. Finally, following up participants at UHR for
psychosis for only 24 months, although informative, limited the definition of remitters,
nonremitters, and nonconverters. Cognitive dedifferentiation phenomena in nonremitters
suggest the likelihood of long-lasting cognitive changes, but a longer prospective study
would help clarify the degree to which these changes are detrimental to other aspects of
clinical outcomes. Such a study would validate remission status (eg, if these cases slip
back to being UHR for psychosis) and elucidate potential biological agent underpinnings
responsible for the deficit.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, to date, this study had 1 of the largest single-site samples of
individuals at UHR for psychosis. It replicates findings in the literature that cognition is
impaired before the onset of psychosis. Baseline cognitive impairment differentiates
nonremitters with more enduring symptomatology from healthy controls and individuals at UHR
for psychosis whose UHR status later remits. Although predominantly a trait, cognitive
architecture shows subtle changes over time in nonremitting individuals at UHR for
psychosis. These cognitive architecture changes are associated with functional outcomes and
may herald a conversion to psychosis and a cognitive architecture similar to
schizophrenia.
