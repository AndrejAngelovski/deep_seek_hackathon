1. Introduction
Thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole systems have been known for more than seven decades [1]. Thiazolo[3,2-a]bezimidazol-3(2H)one (1, Figure 1)) was synthesized in 1926, while thiazolo[3,2-a]-benzimidazole (2, Figure 1) was reported in 1966 [2,3]. Nevertheless, various substituted thiazolo[3,2-a]-benzimidazoles were reported before compound 2 [4,5,6,7,8]. 

Figure 1 Structure of compounds 1 and 2.

In 1988, a review on fused thiazolobenzimidazoles was published by Chimirri et al. [9]. In recent years, there has been considerable interest of researchers in thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazoles, stimulated by their biological activities. Additionally an enormous variety of thiazolo[3,2-a]-benzimidazoles with unique pharmaceutical and medicinal applications have been reported in the patent literature. These considerable biological activities and our contributions to the chemistry and biological activities of these compounds prompted us to compile the present review which deals with the recent synthetic strategies, chemical transformations and biological activities of thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazoles. The intention of this review is to focus mainly on publications appeared from 1989 to the end of 2009.

2. Synthetic Strategies
2.1. From 2-mercaptobenzimidazoles
2-Mercaptobenzimidazoles were used in the synthesis of several thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole derivatives by annulations of thiazole ring to a benzimidazole moiety. The reaction of 2-mercapto-benzimidazole (3) with ketones 4 in boiling AcOH/H2SO4 afforded 2-benzimidazolylthioacetophenone derivatives 5 [10,11,12]. The latter sulphides were cyclized to give the corresponding thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazoles 6 using PPA or [hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodo]benzene (Scheme 1).

molecules-15-03775-scheme1_Scheme 1Scheme 1 Reaction of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (3) with ketones 4.

Treatment of sulphides 5 with acetic anhydride at room temperature gave the N-acetyl derivatives 7. On the other hand, heating of thioacetophenones 5 in acetic anhydride or in Ac2O/pyridine mixture afforded the 2-aroyl-3-methylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazoles 8 [11] which were obtained independently by refluxing N-acetyl derivatives 7 in Ac2O (Scheme 2). 

molecules-15-03775-scheme2_Scheme 2Scheme 2 Cyclization of sulphides 5.

The reaction of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (3) with aliphatic ketones 9a-f [11] such as acetone, acetylacetone, butanone, pentan-2-one and 1-phenylbutan-2-one using acidified acetic acid gave the corresponding thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazoles 10a-f in good yield. Alicyclic ketones 11a-d like cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 2-methylcyclohexanone and cycloheptanone were allowed to react with 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (3) under the same reaction conditions to obtain the tetracyclic compounds 12a-d [11] (Scheme 3).

Thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazoles 2 and 16 [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27] were obtained by the reaction of 2-mercaptobenzimidazoles 3 with various α-halo ketone derivatives 13 (14) which gave the corresponding acyclic intermediates 15. Cyclization of the latter by acetic anhydride/pyridine mixture, polyphosphoric acid or sodium ethoxide gave compounds 16 (Scheme 4). Cyclization of 5-substituted-(2-benzimidazolyl)thioacetic acid 15 (R1 = H, R2 = OH) led to the formation of two isomers with the substituent in 6 or 7 position as established through NMR analysis of the reaction products [25,27] (Scheme 4).

Abdel-Aziz et al. [75] reported the reaction of 3-methylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (15a) with hydrazine hydrate in refluxing ethanol to give the hydrazide 127 (Scheme 38). Treatment of compound 127 with the appropriate aldehydes in refluxing ethanol yielded the corresponding hydrazones 128a-d (Scheme 38). On the other hand, the hydrazide 127 reacts with carbon disulfide in ethanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide to give the potassium salt 129, which reacts with l-aryl-2-bromoethanones to give the 1,3-thiazolidine derivatives 130. Heating of the potassium salt 129 in a aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide afforded 5-(3-methylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazol-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thione (131) (Scheme 38). Moreover, treatment of the potassium salt 129 with hydrazine hydrate in a mixture of ethanol and water afforded 4-amino-5-(3-methylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazol-2-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione (132) [75] (Scheme 38). The structure of compound 132 was further confirmed by an independent synthesis outlined in Scheme 38. Thus, treatment of 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thione derivative 131 with hydrazine hydrate in refluxing ethanol resulted in the formation of a product identical to compound 132. On the other hand, treatment of compound 132 with l-aryl-2-bromoethanones in refluxing ethanol yielded the 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazine derivatives 133. Similarly, the treatment of triazole132 with hydrazonyl halides 20 in ethanol afforded the 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazine derivatives 134 [75] (Scheme 38).

Treatment of the hydrazide 127 with phenyl isothiocyanate in refluxing benzene gave the thiosemicarbazide derivative 138 [75] (Scheme 39). When the latter reaction of the hydrazide 127 with phenyl isothiocyanate was carried out in refluxing DMF instead of benzene, the reaction gave 2-(3-methylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazol-2-yl)-5-phenylamino-1,3,4-oxadiazole (139). On the other hand, the structure of compound 139 was further confirmed by an independent synthesis by treatment of the thiosemicarbazide derivative 138 with potassium iodide and iodine in the presence of sodium hydroxide. Furthermore, The intramolecular cyclization of thiosemicarbazide derivative 138 takes place upon heating with sodium hydroxide to produce the 1,2,4-triazole derivative 140 [75] (Scheme 39).

5. Biological Activities
This section highlights the biological activities of thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazoles published in the last 22 years, as other biological activity appeared up to 1988 were collected in the review of Chimirri et al. [9]. Diverse biological properties have been associated with thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole derivatives in last two decades, including antibacterial [77,93,102], antifungal [69], anti-inflammatory [95,103], antiulcer [104,105,106,107], antiviral [108,109], anthelmintic [18,110] and anticancer activity [71,73,76]. The parasitological study in vitro showed that the heterocyclic benzylidines of thiazolo-[3,2-a]benzimidazoles exhibited higher activity than albendazole against T. spiralis [80].

Moreover, thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole derivatives are well known as platelet activating factor antagonists [111] and neoplasm inhibitors [112]. Some thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole derivatives inhibit H+/K+-ATPase and gastric secretion and are thus useful as antiulcer agents [113]. Furthermore, thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazol-1-oxide (WY-26,769) shows gastric antisecretory activity [114].

3-Amino-derivatives of thiazolobenzimidazole inhibited, to different extents, the oxidation of adrenaline to adrenochrome, thus preventing formation of the superoxide radical [92]. Some synthesized thiazolobenzimidazoles showed antiparasitic activity on the helminth Trichinella spiralis in infected white mice in vitro as well as in vivo [115]. In addition, many thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole derivatives are of great importance due to their antidiabetic [16], broncholytic [91], immunotropic [17] and antitrichomonal activities [116]. On the other hand, several thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole derivatives are used for cancer treatment [117] or prevention of cerebral infarction [118], and the treatment and/or prevention of bone diseases [119].

Tilomisole (WY-18,251) [120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128] (Figure 3) has been widely studied. It showed several potent activities, such as antinflammatory activity [123,124,125,126]. It has been reported to possess remarkable anticancer activity since it could be considered an analog of levamisole, a well-known immunomodulator which is used for the adjuvant treatment of the colon cancer. However, tilomisole (Wy-18,251) has favorable biological response effects in-vivo and it is a suitable alternative to levamisole in cancer treatments [127,128]. 

Figure 3 Chemical structure of tilomisole (WY-18,251) and levamisole.

The combination effect of tilomisole (Wy-18,251) with aspirin or naproxen was studied in rats with carrageenan-induced paw edema and established adjuvant arthritis was reported [126]. Tilomisole was found effective in inhibiting of alpha-interleukin 1 (IL-1)-induced cartilage proteoglycan resorption in-vitro [129].

Pharmacological characterization of 6-amino-N-cyclohexyl-N,3-dimethylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole-2-carboxamide (YM-298198) (Figure 4), a high-affinity, selective, and noncompetitive antagonist of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 was reported [130,131,132,133,134].

Figure 4 Chemical structure of YM-298198.

The mGlu1 antagonist YM-298198 in a physiological functional assay facilitates elucidation of this receptor's role in brain function and as a potential drug target. This compound is more potent than previously available compounds [131,132,133]. However, YM-298198 represented as the most potent known blocker of type I mechanoreceptors [134]. It also used in the treatment of neurogenic pain [135].

6-Aminomethyl-substituted thiazolobenz­imidazole derivatives (R = H) (Figure 5) act as remedies for schizophrenia [136]. These compounds used in treatment or prevention of mGluR1 related diseases [137] (epilepsy, inhibition of nerve cell death, Parkinson's disease, migraine headache, anxiety disorder, cerebral infarction and neurogenic pain). 6-Aminomethyl-substituted fluorothiazolobenz­imidazole derivative (R = F) as a metabotropic glutamate receptor, has excellent activity in oral administration, and is useful as a medicine [138]. 

Figure 5 6-Aminomethyl-substituted thiazolobenz­imidazole derivatives.

The activities of thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole derivatives also extend into fields other than the medicinal one; for example, they are used in magnetic recording disks [139] and in photographic fields [140,141,142].

6. Conclusions
In light of the literature reports cited herein, the synthetic strategies and subsequent chemical transformations of the resulting thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazoles provides several important classes of functionalized compounds. The simplicity and flexibility of the experimental procedures in the generation of these classes, together with the diversity of thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole chemistry, make these synthetic methodologies a highly efficient and practical method for preparation of various biologically active derivatives. The investigations in the pharmaceutical filed and medicinal applications are developing quite rapidly and we hope it will bring new and useful results.
