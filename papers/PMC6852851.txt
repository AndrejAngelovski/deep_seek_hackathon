This research aimed to measure the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD),
effective population size (Ne), and runs of homozygosity (ROHs)
in one of the major Iranian sheep breeds (Zandi) using 96 samples genotyped
with Illumina Ovine SNP50 BeadChip. The amount of LD (r2) for
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs in short distances (10–20 kb)
was 0.21±0.25 but rapidly decreased to 0.10±0.16 by increasing the
distance between SNP pairs (40–60 kb). The Ne of Zandi sheep in
past (approximately 3500 generations ago) and recent (five generations ago)
populations was estimated to be 6475 and 122, respectively. The ROH-based
inbreeding was 0.023. We found 558 ROH regions, of which 37 % were
relatively long (>10 Mb). Compared with the rate of LD
reduction in other species (e.g., cattle and pigs), in Zandi, it was reduced
more rapidly by increasing the distance between SNP pairs. According to the
LD pattern and high genetic diversity of Zandi sheep, we need to use an SNP
panel with a higher density than Illumina Ovine SNP50 BeadChip for genomic
selection and genome-wide association studies in this breed.
==== Body
1 Introduction
The population of sheep in Iran, consisting of many different breeds, is
estimated to be approximately 50 million, which constitutes the most
important economic area in the livestock industry of the country (Moradi
et al., 2012). According to Rashidi et al. (2008), the sheep industry
contributes about 35 % of the meat production in Iran. As the supply of
meat production from sheep does not satisfy the demand, a breeding plan
seems reasonable to enhance the profitability of sheep production by
improving such traits as litter size, body conformation, lamb weight, and
other economically important traits (Ghafouri-Kesbi et al., 2008). The
Zandi breed is one of the major, indigenous, fat-tailed sheep breeds of Iran
that has adapted to survive in harsh weather conditions and poor and
mountainous pastures in the central regions of the country (Mohammadi et
al., 2013). Probably because of its large population in Iran (about 2 million heads),
there is much interest in genetically improving Zandi sheep
for growth traits (Ghafouri-Kesbi et al., 2008; Mohammadi et al., 2013).

The adoption of such new technologies as genomic selection can play an essential
role in satisfying the demand for meat production. One advantage of genomic
over traditional selection methods is that selection candidates can be
evaluated more accurately at very early ages, which increases the rate of
genetic gain (Hayes et al., 2013). Also, the accuracy of genomic
selection is regularly higher than that of traditional pedigree-based
selection (Goddard and Hayes, 2011). So, there is potential to increase
genetic gain in Zandi sheep by adopting genomic selection technology;
however, the success of genomic selection relies on the level of genome-wide
linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and causal mutations (Hayes
et al., 2013). The nonrandom association between alleles of different
variants throughout the genome in the population is known as LD. The main
reason for this association, or correlation between alleles of different
markers, is their physical closeness. However, some other factors, such as
genetic drift, migration, and, more importantly, either artificial or natural
selection, also affect the LD and its pattern (Wang, 2005). Measuring the
amount of genome-wide LD in a population can help us estimate the number of
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers required to have robust genomic
evaluations (Hayes and Goddard, 2001) and genome-wide association studies
(GWASs) (Carlson et al., 2004).

The extent of genome-wide LD can also help us estimate past effective
population sizes (Ne) and rates of recombination in a population.
Information on past Ne is critical to define optimal selection
pressures (Rexroad and Vallejo, 2009) for obtaining breeding goals while
sustaining acceptable levels of genetic heterogeneity in breeding
populations (Scraggs et al., 2014). Reduction in genetic diversity can
reduce the profitability of animal production, which is often referred to as
the “inbreeding effect” (Leroy, 2014; Notter, 1999). A meta-analysis of 57
studies on seven livestock species and a wide range of traits showed
that approximately 0.14 % of the mean of the traits decreased for every 1 %
increase in inbreeding (Leroy, 2014). The inbreeding coefficient can be
investigated by studying the length of identical haplotype segments
inherited from parents to progeny. In such investigations, the successive
homozygous genotypes in the progeny are known as runs of homozygosity
(ROHs). Hence, the aims of this research were to (1) measure the amount and
pattern of LD, (2) examine genetic diversity by measuring Ne and
ROH-based inbreeding, and (3) estimate the minimum number of SNPs required
for robust genomic selection and GWASs in Zandi sheep.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Sample collection and quality control
Blood samples were taken from 99 Zandi sheep at the Khojir sheep breeding
station in Iran. All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by
the research ethics committee of the University of Tehran, College of
Agriculture and Natural Resources. The genomic DNA was extracted using the
standard salting-out protocol (Helms, 1990). The samples were genotyped using
Illumina Ovine SNP50 BeadChip for 54 241 SNP markers; the version of the
ovine assembly used in our research was Ovis_aries_v4.0 obtained
from the SNPchiMP v3 database (Nicolazzi et al., 2015). The filtering process was
completed using PLINK V1.9 (Chang et al., 2015). Of 99 genotyped animals,
three samples were excluded due to low genotype quality (missing genotypes
>10 %), and the remaining 96 samples had a genotyping call
rate >98.2 %. SNPs were removed due to (1) having an
unknown map position (n=387), (2) being located on sex chromosomes
(n=1449), (3) having
an SNP missing rate of more than 10 % (n=948), (4) deviating from
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with a p value <10-6
(n=132), and (5) having a minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than 0.01 (n=2068). Then, using a
genomic relationship matrix (VanRaden, 2008), we ran a principal component
analysis (PCA) to explore the covariance between animals.

2.2 LD calculation
LD was calculated by r2 (Hill and Robertson, 1968) for two loci (A and
B) with two alleles (allele 1 and allele 2) using Eq. (1):
 1 r2=fA1B1fA2B2-fA1B2fA2B12fA1fB1fA2fB2, 
where fA1B1, fA1B2, fA2B1, and fA2B2 are the frequencies of
haplotypes A1B1, A1B2, A2B1, and A2B2;
fA1, fA2, fB1, and f(B2) are the frequencies of the
first and second allele of loci A and B. The expected frequency for
haplotype A1B1 is fA1fB1.
Thus, the difference between the observed and expected frequency of a given
haplotype indicates the LD between the two markers.

To measure LD, haplotypes were inferred using Beagle v3.3.2 (Browning and
Browning, 2007), separately for each ovine autosome. Missing genotypes after
quality control (0.018 %) were also imputed during haplotype phasing. The
phased haplotypes were read into HAPLOVIEW v4.2 (Barrett et al., 2004) to
calculate LD. For each autosome, r2 was computed for all pairs of SNPs
located up to 5 Mb apart. The pairwise LDs calculated by HAPLOVIEW were
assigned into different classes according to pairwise distances (i.e., 0–10,
10–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–100, 100–200, and 200–500 kb; 0.5–1.0,
1.0–2.0, and 2.0–5.0 Mb), and the average r2 was calculated in each
category using R software (R Core Team, 2014).

2.3 Estimation of Ne
The Ne was estimated using SNeP v1.1 (Barbato et al., 2015) using
Eq. (2) (Corbin et al., 2012):
 2 Net=14fct1Eradjusted2|ct-α, 
where Net is an estimation of Ne
t
generations ago; ct is the pairwise genomic physical distance showing
the recombination rate t generations ago (i.e., t=1/2c); and α
is a constant in the equation to correct for the occurrence of mutations (if
required). However, instead of assuming 1 cM =1 Mb, a recombination rate
modifier in Eq. (3) was used to calculate c (Sved, 1971):
 3 c=d1-(d/2)(1-d)2, 
where d is the linkage at distance c, which can be estimated using
r2 adjusted for sample size (adjustment required if the sample size
is small). In this study, the default parameters of “1” and “no correction”
were used for α and sample size adjustment, respectively.

2.4 ROH mapping
ROHs in the genotyped sheep were found using PLINK V1.9 according to the
following criteria. Each ROH had at least one SNP per 100 kb and a minimum
length of 4 Mb. The sliding window under examination was allowed to contain
up to one heterozygous SNP, and the minimum number of SNPs for a given ROH was
determined using Eq. (4) (Lencz et al., 2007):
 4 l=logeαninsloge(1-het), 
where ns and ni represent the number of genotyped SNPs per animal
and the number of animals, respectively; α is the percentage of false
positive ROHs (set to 0.05 in the current study), and “het” is the mean
SNP heterozygosity across all SNPs. Using R software (R Core Team, 2014), the
detected ROH was assigned into different length categories, including 4–10,
10–20, 20–30, and >30 Mb, and the frequency of different
ROH lengths was calculated. Moreover, ROH-based inbreeding (FROH)
for each individual was calculated using Eq. (5)
(McQuillan et al., 2008):
 5 FROHi=∑j=1nLROHjLGenome 
where FROHi is the FROH (inbreeding) for the ith animal;
n and LROHj are the total number of ROHs and the length of the
jth ROH for the ith animal, respectively; and LGenome is the
genome length covered by the SNP markers (i.e., 2645.2 Mb in our study).

3 Results
3.1 Descriptive statistics
After quality control, the final dataset consisted of 96 animals genotyped
for 49 257 SNPs covering 2.6452 Gb of the ovine genome. The average
distance between adjacent SNPs was 53.73±55.60 kb, and the average MAF
was 0.28±0.01. The number of SNPs varied on ovine autosomes, with OAR1
as the longest and OAR24 as the shortest ovine autosome containing 11.3 %
(n=5563) and 1.4 % (n=702) of SNPs, respectively. The average
inter-marker distance was the shortest in OAR9 (49.9 kb) and the longest in
OAR21 (65.2 kb). Further details for the SNPs located on the same chromosome
are presented in Table 1. The distribution of MAF for the SNPs that passed
the quality control process is shown as a histogram in Supplement Fig. S1;
approximately 48 % of the SNPs had MAF ≥0.30 and approximately
5.1 % of the SNPs had MAF between 0.01 and 0.05. As illustrated in
Fig. 1, the relationship between the first two principal components described
only 10.5 % of the total variation among samples.

3.2 Extent of genome-wide LD
The reduction in LD (r2) by increasing the pairwise distance between
SNPs is presented in Table 2. The average r2 was 0.26±0.30 when the
pairwise distance between SNPs was <10 kb, but it rapidly
decreased to 0.21±0.25 when the distance increased to 10–20 kb. At the
pairwise distance of 40–60 kb, which was close to the average inter-marker
space in this study, the average r2 was only 0.10±0.16. The
percentage of pairwise SNPs with high LD (r2≥0.20) up to 10 kb
apart was 39 %, which decreased to 16 % for the SNP pairs
with 40–60 kb of distance (Table 2). The average LD between SNPs with up to
5 Mb of distance (4 481 704 SNP pairs) is presented for all 26 ovine
autosomes (Table S1 in the Supplement). Moreover, r2 was calculated for
only the adjacent SNP pairs (0.13±0.19), of which up to 51 % of SNP
pairs had r2<0.05 and only 19.1 % had r2>0.2 (Fig. S2).

Figure 1 PCA plot based on a genomic relationship matrix. The first two
principal components (PCs) and the variance explained by each component is
shown on the corresponding axis. The amount of variance explained by the
first two components is relatively small (10.5 %), representing a great
deal of genetic diversity among samples.

Ne

The historical and recent Ne values were estimated using average r2
calculated in different pairwise distances between SNPs. The Ne of
approximately 3500 generations ago was estimated to be 6475, which
decreased to approximately 3000 about 500 generations ago and then
continued to decline more rapidly until recent generations. We estimated that the
Ne for Zandi sheep five generations ago was 122 (Fig. 2). A plot
magnifying the changes in Ne of more recent generations is also illustrated
in Fig. S3.

Figure 2 Estimation of effective population size (Ne) of Zandi sheep
using genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (r2) between SNPs. Ne was
estimated using average r2 between markers at different distances by
SNeP software. The Ne in the past (approximately 3500 generations ago)
was 6475, which decreased to 3000 approximately 500 generations ago and
then continued to decrease more rapidly until recent generations. The
Ne of recent populations (up to five generations ago) was estimated to
be 122.

3.4 ROHs and ROH-based inbreeding (FROH)
In total, 558 ROHs were detected for 89 sheep with an average length of
10.77±8.36 Mb (Fig. 3), and no ROH was found for the 7 remaining
sheep (Table S2). The ROH segments with a length of 4–10 Mb were the most
frequent (62 %), and those with a length of more than 30 Mb were the least
frequent (3.2 %) (Fig. 3). The average number and median of ROHs detected
in the 89 sheep were 6.3±4.2 and 5, respectively. The maximum number
of ROHs found in one animal was 19. The longest ROH (72.4 Mb) consisted of
1425 SNPs, and the shortest ROH (4.02 Mb) consisted of 64 SNPs (Table S2).

Figure 3 Frequency and proportion of detected ROHs with different lengths (Mb).
In total, 558 ROHs (with average length of 10.77±8.36 Mb) were detected
in 89 sheep, and in 7 remaining sheep no ROHs were found. The ROH segments with
the length of 4–10 Mb were the most frequent (62.2 %), and those with the length
of >30 Mb were the least frequent (3.2 %).

Figure 4 Number of detected ROHs and percent of coverage per autosome.
In total, 558 ROHs were detected. For each autosome, the average length of
a ROH (for the sheep with at least one ROH) was divided by the length of the
chromosome to calculate the percentage of each autosome covered by ROHs. OAR1
with 60 ROHs (average length of 12.9±8.8 Mb) had the highest number of
ROHs, and OAR14, OAR16, and OAR24 with 9 ROHs (average length of 10.3±5.9 Mb) had the lowest number of ROHs.

In ovine autosomes of Zandi sheep in our study, OAR1 had 60 ROHs, but OAR14,
16, and 24 had only 9 ROHs (Fig. 4). Hence, these chromosomes had the most
and the minimum number of ROHs, respectively. We found a strong correlation
(Pearson's correlation coefficient +0.95) between the number of ROHs
and chromosome length and also between percentage of coverage and
chromosome length (Pearson's correlation coefficient -0.79) (see Table 1
and Fig. 4). The average of ROH-based inbreeding (FROH) for Zandi
sheep with and without including the seven animals that had no ROHs was 0.023
and 0.026, respectively. The four animals with the highest degree of
homozygosity indicated 302.4, 275.1, 234.9, and 178.4 Mb of their genome
classified as ROHs, covering close to 9 % of their total genome length
(Table S2).

4 Discussion
One of the main factors affecting LD measurement is population structure.
Overestimation of LD occurs when samples are close relatives; in fact, they
share longer haplotypes than distant relatives (Ghoreishifar et al.,
2018; Gusev et al., 2011). In the Zandi breed, LD remained at a moderate
level (r2=0.26±0.30) only up to 10 kb and decreased rapidly to
0.10±0.16 when the average SNP pair distance was 40–60 kb. This
pattern of LD decay illustrates that short-length haplotypes are prevalent
in the population, which means that samples are not close relatives.
Also, only 10.5 % of the total variation is explained by the first two
principal components, representing a great deal of diversity among
samples.

The average of r2 varied across autosomes (ranging from 0.16 in OAR26
to 0.34 in OAR10 for the pairwise distance of <10 kb), which is
in line with previous reports in sheep (Liu et al., 2017; Prieur et al.,
2017; Zhao et al., 2014), beef cattle (Bohmanova et al., 2010; Edea et al.,
2015), and dairy cattle (Qanbari et al., 2010). This phenomenon can be due to
variation in the recombination rate in different autosomes, natural or
artificial selection, and genetic drift (Liu et al., 2017; Mastrangelo et
al., 2017; Qanbari et al., 2010). Moreover, the variation in r2
estimated for different chromosomes was higher in short SNP pair distances
(e.g., SD =0.048 in 0–10 kb vs. SD =0.001 in 4.0–5.0 Mb), which is in line with the results
reported by Liu et al. (2017).

The r2 we calculated for the Zandi breed was close to the amount of LD
reported in some other sheep breeds. For example, in Churra sheep, the
average r2 for the pairwise space of 0–10 kb and 0.5–1.0 Mb was 0.33
and 0.05, respectively (García-Gámez et al., 2012). In Chinese
Merino sheep, the average r2 for the same marker intervals was 0.25
and 0.02, respectively (Liu et al., 2017). However, in Barbaresca
sheep, with a small sample size, the average r2 for the inter-marker
distance of 0.5–1.0 Mb was 0.12 (Mastrangelo et al., 2017). The average
r2 for SNPs within 10 kb of distance for Australian Border
Leicester, Poll Dorset, and Merino sheep breeds were 0.34, 0.33, and 0.27,
respectively (Al-Mamun et al., 2015). Thus, the variation in the reported r2 in different
breeds suggests that the characteristics of
LD are highly breed-specific in sheep.

The power of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and the accuracy of
genomic predictions largely depend on the amount of LD between SNPs and
quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) (Hayes et al., 2013). Generally,
when the extent of LD between markers decreases rapidly by increasing the
inter-marker distances, the number of markers required for a robust genomic
study should be kept high. Hayes and Goddard (2001) demonstrated that the
accuracy of genomic predictions for dairy cattle reached 85 % when the
average r2 between adjacent markers was ≥0.2. However, higher LD
between markers (r2≥0.3) might be required for precise QTL
mapping (Corbin et al., 2012). In our study, the average r2 was
0.21±0.25 when the distance between pairwise SNPs was 10–20 kb.
However, the average inter-marker distance was 53.73±55.60 kb, and
the average r2 for only adjacent SNPs was 0.13±0.19 (19 % of
adjacent SNPs had r2>0.2). Hence, our findings support the
necessity of denser SNP panels for a successful genomic selection scheme in
Zandi sheep.

The level of LD in Zandi sheep was less than it is in cattle (Biegelmeyer
et al., 2016; Bohmanova et al., 2010; Jasielczuk et al., 2016) and pigs
(Grossi et al., 2017) but close to the level of LD reported for other
sheep breeds (Al-Mamun et al., 2015; García-Gámez et al., 2012; Liu
et al., 2017). For example, Qanbari et al. (2010) reported r2 of
0.20±0.24 for SNPs within 50–75 kb in German Holstein dairy cattle.
Moreover, the average r2 for inter-marker distance <10 kb
in Hereford and Bradford beef cattle breeds was reported at 0.49 and 0.43,
respectively (Biegelmeyer et al., 2016). We found that for a very
short inter-marker distance (<10 kb), the calculated r2 in
Zandi sheep was 0.26±0.30.

For the very recent generations (i.e., fewer than five generations ago), the
accuracy of estimating Ne is negatively affected by the low level
of LD between SNPs at long distances (Liu et al., 2017). Thus, we estimated
the Ne in Zandi sheep up to five generations ago. The estimated
Ne in Zandi sheep for 59 and 80 generations ago was 786 and 1035,
respectively, which is in line with the large Ne
(>500) reported for various breeds of sheep in the HapMap
project (Kijas et al., 2012). The low level of r2 even at relatively
short distances shows the Ne in Zandi sheep was large in recent
past generations compared with other species. For example, the r2 for
SNP pairs within 0.9–1.0 Mb and the Ne in recent generations in
Duroc pigs were reported to be 0.2 and 75, respectively (Grossi et al.,
2017). The r2 (same SNP pair distance) and the Ne
in recent generations of Zandi sheep were 0.07 and 122. The estimated
genome-based Ne (i.e., NeSNP=122) in the current
study was higher than the pedigree-based Ne reported for Zandi
(i.e., NePED=66) in Ghafouri-Kesbi et al. (2008), in which the
estimated NePED is likely to be less accurate due to the lack
of precise and in-depth pedigree records for this breed. However, results
should be interpreted with caution since other factors such as sampling
itself, for example, can potentially affect the results. The threshold of 100
for Ne has been recommended for many species to maintain genetic
diversity in the population
(Meuwissen, 2009). The Ne of Zandi sheep five generations ago (122)
was above the recommended critical threshold. However, given the sharp drop
in Ne in recent generations, we should be careful to maintain the
Ne larger than 100.

We observed that the Ne decreased more intensively from roughly 550
generations ago, which is in agreement with the results reported for a
couple of Iranian fat-tailed sheep breeds by Moradi et al. (2017).
Considering a generation interval of 4 to 5 years for sheep, this point
coincides with the period when the first archaeological evidence of
Iranian fat-tailed sheep breeds at Takht-Jamshid, Iran, was obtained
(Moradi et al., 2017). These results may support the hypothesis that
selection for fat-tailed trait in Iranian indigenous sheep populations
occurred nearly 2500 years ago and has continued since then. However, more
evidence is required to reinforce this hypothesis.

One of the main factors affecting autozygosity estimates is the density of
SNP chips applied to generate the data for ROH studies. Marras et al. (2015),
in a study of ROHs applying a medium-density chip, reported that when
heterozygous SNPs were allowed, the number of longer ROHs increased
dramatically and suggested not using them in the ROH. Ferenčaković
et al. (2013) reported that the 50K SNP panel
led to the overestimation of short-length
ROHs
(<4 Mb), probably because of heterozygous SNPs on high-density
chips that may not exist on a medium-density one. Hence, they proposed that
the 50K panel does not have enough sensitivity for the accurate determination of
short runs of homozygosity (i.e., <4 Mb length). In our study,
because a medium-density SNP panel was adopted, we outlined ROHs as regions of
homozygous genotypes that had at least 4 Mb of length distinguished with a
maximum number of one heterozygous SNP.

Long ROHs in an individual can occur due to either inbreeding events or
selection pressure (Mastrangelo et al., 2016). Since the Zandi population is
subject to selection programs (Ghafouri-Kesbi et al., 2008; Mohammadi et al.,
2013), the occurrence or runs of homozygosity in this breed can be attributed
to both inbreeding effects and selection pressure. In the ROH analysis of
Zandi sheep, around 37.8 % of the detected ROH was relatively long
(>10 Mb) and 62.2 % was shorter than 10 Mb. As reported
in the literature, in Barbaresca sheep, 67 % of the detected ROH was
short (ranging from 1 to 10 Mb) (Mastrangelo et al., 2017), and in some
local breeds of dairy cattle, approximately 23 % of the detected ROH was
longer than 10 Mb (Mastrangelo et al., 2016). However, comparing different
ROH studies is not a straightforward matter because different researchers use
different criteria, especially for the minimum length of a ROH and the minimum
number of SNPs included in a ROH.

5 Conclusions
We found that in Zandi sheep, the amount of LD was relatively small between
the adjacent SNPs in Illumina Ovine SNP50 BeadChip (0.13±0.19), and
it decreased rapidly by increasing the distance between the markers. Therefore,
a high-density SNP panel is required for a robust genomic selection and fine
mapping of QTLs in this breed. Given the total length of autosomes in sheep
(2645.1 Gb) and the average level of LD between SNPs in 5 kb
(r2≈0.26) and 15 kb (r2≈0.21), we estimated that
approximately 180 000 and 530 000 evenly spaced SNPs are required to
increase the r2 to 0.20 and 0.25, respectively. Compared with other
species, average inbreeding in Zandi sheep was found to be relatively
low (0.023). In our study, 7 sheep were not inbred (FROH=0), and
the inbreeding level of 35 sheep was more than the average level of
inbreeding. Thus, optimal mating designs can be beneficial in controlling
population inbreeding in Zandi sheep. Although the Ne of the Zandi breed is
not critically low, given the sharp decrease in Ne in recent
generations, we should be careful to ensure the Ne remains large.
