Correction to: European Journal of Human Genetics

10.1038/s41431-019-0402-9

In the text of the original article linked to this correction article, we the authors include the ICD-10 codes for the diagnoses we used. We would also like to add the corresponding ICD-8 codes for some of the diagnoses, as a minority of the individuals might have received them while ICD-8 was being used in Denmark. This does not change the results or conclusions of the paper. However, for the sake of completeness, we believe the text should mention the codes that would have been used in those cases, in case the reader may need to look them up and/or compare them to studies which used ICD-8. Since the association with intellectual disability was the main new result from the paper, and some individuals received this diagnosis at a young age, unlike e.g. schizophrenia, they could have received an ICD-8 code (ICD-8 was used until 1994 and the first year of birth for the cohort is 1981), so it is important to note the codes used in those cases. We apologize for their omission from the original text. The original and revised text is as follows:

Original text (page 2 of the online PDF; page 1,446 of the printed PDF):

The phenotype groups included in this study were as follows: controls (no psychiatric or neurodevelopmental diagnoses, as per ICD-10 codes F00–F99); schizophrenia cases (F20); bipolar disorder (BPD) cases (F30–F31); single and recurrent depressive disorder cases (F32–F33); anorexia nervosa cases (F50.0); ASD cases (F84.0, F84.1, F84.5, F84.8, and F84.9), ADHD cases (F90.0) and intellectual disability (ID) cases (F70–F79).

Revised text:

The phenotype groups included in this study were as follows: controls (no psychiatric or neurodevelopmental diagnoses, as per ICD-10 codes F00–F99; equivalent ICD-8 codes 290–315); schizophrenia cases (F20; 295.x9 excluding 295.79); bipolar disorder (BPD) cases (F30–F31; 296.19, 296.39, 298.19); single and recurrent depressive disorder cases (F32–F33; 296.09, 296.29, 298.09, 300.49); anorexia nervosa cases (F50.0; 306.50); ASD cases (F84.0, F84.1, F84.5, F84.8, and F84.9), ADHD cases (F90.0) and intellectual disability (ID) cases (F70–F79; 311.xx, 312.xx, 313.xx, 314.xx, 315.xx).
