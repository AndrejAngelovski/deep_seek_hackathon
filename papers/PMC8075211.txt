Background

Major depressive disorder with psychotic features (MDDPsy), compared to nonpsychotic MDD, involves an increased risk of suicide and failure to achieve treatment response. Symptom scales can be useful to assess patients with MDDPsy. The aim of the present study was to validate French versions of the Delusion Assessment Scale (DAS) and Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS).

Methods

One hundred patients were included. The scales were filled out by psychiatrists. Data from participants who accepted a second interview were used for inter-judge reliability. The scalability and psychometric properties of both scales were assessed.

Results

Data from 94 patients were used. Owing to low score variability between patients, the predefined threshold for scalability (≥0.40) was not reached for both scales. Factorial analysis of the DAS identified five factors, different from those of the original version. Five factors were also identified in the PDAS, of which two comprised items from the HDRS and the other three items from the BPRS. Floor and ceiling effects were observed in both scales, due in part to the construction of certain subscales. Unlike the PDAS, the DAS had good internal consistency. Multiple correlations were observed between the DAS dimensions but none between those of the PDAS. Both scales showed good inter-judge reliability. Convergent validity analyses showed correlations with HDRS, BPRS and CGI.

Limitations

Inter-judge reliability was calculated from a relatively small number of volunteers.

Conclusions

The good psychometric properties of the French versions of the DAS and PDAS could help in assessing MDDPsy, in particular its psychotic features, and hence improve response to treatment and prognosis.

==== Body
Introduction

Major depressive disorder with psychotic features (MDDPsy) is defined by the presence of delusions and/or hallucinations during the episode of major depression [1]. Studies have reported a prevalence rate of psychotic features in MDD ranging from 11 to 18.5% [2–4]. MDDPsy is characterized by a greater depressive symptom severity and a higher probability of melancholic features. In addition, patients with MDDPsy have a greater risk of suicide than nonpsychotic MDD patients [5, 6]. They also have greater probability of inpatient treatment. Most international guidelines recommend the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic or electroconvulsive therapy for the treatment of MDDPsy [7–11]. However, MDDPsy patients are more likely not to achieve treatment response than nonpsychotic MDD patients [4]. MDDPsy is associated with greater psychosocial impairment [12] and decreased quality of life [13]. Combined assessment of psychotic characteristics and overall severity is crucial in MDDPsy [14].

Symptom scales can be useful tools for assessment of measurement-based care for the individual patient and for evaluating and monitoring outcomes in research studies. There exist validated scales that can help to assess patients suffering from MDDPsy [14] which could be more widely used if they were made available in the mother tongue of clinician-researchers. We decided therefore to select two scales among validated rating scales measuring psychotic depression, the Delusion Assessment Scale (DAS), designed specifically for the assessment of delusions in MDDPsy [15], and the Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS), which assesses the overall severity of depressive and psychotic symptoms in MDDPsy [16] and has also shown promising results in detecting the occurrence of psychotic depression among patients with depressive disorders in general [17, 18]. The present study aimed to validate French versions of the DAS and PDAS after evaluation of their psychometric properties for use in measuring the severity of psychotic depression in MDDPsy patients.

Methods

Study design

The project was approved by the local Ethical Review Board (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-Est VI Clermont-Ferrand, IRB 00008526) and conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. A psychiatrist explained the aims and procedures to the patients and collected their consent to participate in the study. All patients received written information about the study and were entitled to refuse use of the data collected at any time.

The psychiatrist completed the DAS and PDAS scales after a routine interview with patients shortly after hospital admission. Data from patients who accepted an interview with a second psychiatrist were used for the inter-judge reliability assessment.

Participants

Inpatients aged 18 or older with fluent command of French were recruited from the psychiatric units of the university hospital and the psychiatric hospital centres of Clermont-Ferrand and Le Puy en Velay. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features on the basis of DSM 5 criteria [1], a delusional idea as defined in DSM-5 with a rating ≥3 (delusion definitely present) on the delusional rating item of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia [19] and a score of ≥2 on one of the DAS conviction items, and a score of ≥ 21 on the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Scale [20].

Exclusion criteria were a history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, shared psychotic disorder, mania, dementia, history of drug or alcohol abuse in the past three months, taking medication likely to induce psychiatric symptoms or disorders or having an unstable or life-threatening medical illness, and meeting criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder.

Instruments

The DAS instrument

The DAS assesses domains of delusional ideation in patients with MDDPsy. It expands the five single-item domains of the DDERS [21]—conviction, pressure, extension, bizarreness and disorganization—into a 14-item scale with each item rated on 1–3 anchor points. The highest score for each item corresponds to greatest disease severity. A fifteenth item was added to assess mood congruence, which corresponds to a single separate dimension. Rating was performed by an assessor after a standard clinical interview, observation of the patient and reading of comments made by the care team or close friends or family. An instruction manual is available to guide the interview and ratings. It is recommended to assess the severity of symptoms over the past week [15].

Instrument translation

The DAS was cross-culturally adapted from English into French following established guidelines [22], with the kind permission of the author of the original instrument (Barnett S. Meyers, M.D.). Forward translations were independently made by three psychiatrists fluent in English (CR, SN, IJ), and one bilingual translator, naive to the outcome measure (UTJ), all of whom had French as their mother tongue. A native English translator fluent in French (JW) with a medical background blinded to the original English version then made a backward translation. A multidisciplinary expert committee reviewed the process, compared source and target versions, and resolved discrepancies. Item-translation, semantic, idiomatic, experiential, and conceptual equivalents were discussed. Finally, the consensus target version was adopted by the committee as the pre-final cross-cultural adaptation (S1 File).

We then made an evaluation of the psychometric properties of DAS, given in detail below.

The PDAS instrument

The PDAS was constructed specifically to assess the severity of psychotic depression in patients with MDDPsy [16]. It is composed of six items from the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D6) [20] and five items from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS5) [23], both of which are publicly available. In addition, there exist validated French versions of these two scales [24, 25]. The total PDAS score is obtained by adding up the sum of the individual item scores after converting the BPRS item scores to a score between 0 and 4 with the formula (BPRS score– 1) x 2/3, and multiplying the score for item 13 on the Hamilton scale (general somatic) by 2 [16]. Rating is performed by the assessor on the basis of a clinical interview and observation of the patient during the conversation. Guidelines recommended assessing the severity of symptoms over the past week [14].

Assessments

The sociodemographic and medical characteristics of all participants were collected. For each patient, the DAS was completed by a psychiatrist. The following scales were also administered by the psychiatrist: the 17-item version of the HDRS [20] and the 18-item BPRS [23] from which were extracted, respectively, the six and five specific items to construct the PDAS, the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) to classify the type of delusion [26], the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [27], the delusional rating item of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia [19], and the CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression of severity) [28].

All data are available at Mendeley [29].

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed with Stata software (version 13, StataCorp, College Station, TX). P-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

In accordance with recommendations set out by COSMIN [30] and Terwee et al. [31], we included a minimum number of 100 subjects to ensure satisfactory internal consistency evaluation and a sample size of at least 50 patients to guarantee an acceptable estimate of reliability.

In addition to descriptive statistics, the following psychometric properties of the DAS and PDAS scales were evaluated.

Scalability was assessed by Mokken analysis, generating a Loevinger coefficient of homogeneity for the PDAS total score. In Mokken analysis, a Loevinger coefficient of homogeneity ≥0.40 is indicative of scalability [32]. For the present analysis the BPRS scores were converted as follows: 1 = 0, 2–3 = 1, 4–5 = 2, 6 = 3, and 7 = 4.

Descriptive statistics and score distributions. In addition to mean and standard-deviation, score range, closeness of mean to median, and floor and ceiling effects [31] were calculated.

An exploratory factorial analysis (principal components analysis with varimax rotation) was performed to determine the scale structure. The number of factors was chosen according to usual recommendations: Kaiser criteria, plot of eigenvalues, and part of variance expressed by principal components. For items loading on several factors, the decision to do factor attribution was made according to psychometric results and clinical relevance.

Internal consistency was determined through Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (minimum accepted value: 0.70 [33]), the item homogeneity coefficient (criterion value: ≥ 0.30 [34]) and the item-total correlation corrected for overlap (criterion value: ≥ 0.30 [35]).

Internal validity was determined by study of correlation between the domains making up the scale (standard, ƿ = 0.30–0.70 [36]).

Reproducibility. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to determine inter-judge reliability. Values of concordance correlation coefficient greater than 0.70 were considered to be satisfactory [31].

Convergent validity. The relationships between DAS and PDAS scale scores and other quantitative measurements (HDRS, BPRS, CGI and SAPS) were studied with correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman according to statistical distribution). Association was considered to be weak for a correlation coefficient between 0.3 and 0.5, and moderate to high for a correlation coefficient greater than 0.5.

Results

Of the 100 patients initially recruited, 6 were excluded following reassessment of their diagnosis (3 bipolar disorders, 1 psychotic disorder, 1 dementia, and 1 depression caused by somatic disorders). The characteristics of the remaining 94 patients are given in Table 1. Fifty-one (55%) of the patients were female; they had a mean age of 62.2 ± 17.7 years old and 50% were more than 65 years old. Median HDRS and BPRS scores were 25.5 [24–30] and 58 [51–66], respectively. All patients had at least one clearly defined delusion and a score of ≥3 on the delusion severity rating item of the SADS.

Scalability of the DAS and PDAS scales

The Loevinger coefficients of homogeneity derived from the Mokken analyses were 0.39 for DAS and 0.28 for PDAS. The predefined threshold for scalability (≥0.40) was not achieved despite significant results on both scales (p < 0.001). The Loevinger coefficients of homogeneity were 0.39 for HAM-D6 and 0.33 for BPRS5, both composing the PDAS.

Factorial analysis

The 11-item and 15-item structures of the PDAS and DAS, respectively, were tested by factorial analysis with varimax rotation. Five factors accounting for 70.2% of the total variance were extracted and gave the best factor structure solution for PDAS (Table 2). HDRS items loaded on two factors and BPRS items on three. Only the item “Work and activities” (HDRS 7) loaded on two factors (1 and 3, both composed of HDRS items) and was finally associated with factor 3 designated “Fatigue/activities”. Other dimensions were “Depression”, “Emotional withdrawal/Blunted affect”, “Psychotic symptoms” and “Suspiciousness”.

For the DAS, four factors accounting for 60.7% of the total variance were extracted (Table 3). Factor 1 grouped together the “Conviction” and “Impact” dimensions of the original DAS and was named “Delusional conviction”. Factor 2 grouped together the “Disorganization” and “Mood congruence” dimensions and item 8 “People/objects involved” of the original DAS. This factor formed the “Disorganization/Mood congruence” dimension. The “Bizarreness” dimension was retained and constituted factor 3. Two items, one negative and one positive, were loaded on factor 4: “Acting irrationally distrustful during the interview” (negative) and “Places/situations involved” (positive). This gave two dimensions “Acting irrationally during interview” and “Places/situations involved”.

A ceiling effect was observed for the “Places/situations involved” dimension of the DAS and floor effects for the dimensions of “Disorganization/Mood congruence”, “Bizarreness”, “Acting irrationally during interview” and “Places/situations involved”.

Internal consistency

The DAS showed good internal consistency with Cronbach’s α greater than the minimum required coefficient of 0.70 for all dimensions (Table 5). The PDAS showed lower Cronbach’s α (0.29 to 0.59). Only the “Emotional withdrawal/ Blunted affect” dimension had a Cronbach’s α coefficient greater than 0.70.

Inter-item correlations

The PDAS showed weak inter-item correlations (from 0.00 à 0.68). Correlations were only good for items belonging to the same dimension. The DAS showed stronger and more significant inter-item correlations (from 0.00 to 0.70) (S1 and S2 Tables).

Item-total correlations

The PDAS showed moderate corrected item-total correlations with a coefficient greater than 0.30 for only three items, whereas the DAS showed good corrected item-total correlations (only three items were lower than 0.30) (S1 and S2 Tables).

Inter-scale correlations

No correlation was observed between the dimensions of the PDAS (Fig 1 and S3 Table). The DAS dimensions had multiple correlations with only the “Acting irrationally during interview” dimension not correlating with any other.

Inter-judge reliability

Twenty-six participants accepted to be assessed by a second psychiatrist. The PDAS and DAS both had good inter-judge reliability. Only one dimension showed an intraclass correlation coefficient lower than 0.70 in each scale: “Fatigue/activities” in PDAS (0.68 [0.46–0.89]) and “Bizarreness” in DAS (0.49 [0.19–0.79]). Others varied from 0.77 to 0.93 for PDAS and from 0.77 to 1.00 for DAS.

PDAS correlated with all the other scales tested (HDRS, BPRS, CGI and SAPS) and with several subscales (Fig 1 and S3 Table). The strongest correlation was with the total BPRS (r = 0.82, p<0.0001). All PDAS dimensions correlated with the total BPRS, with correlation coefficients varying from 0.25 to 0.51. Only the two dimensions of “Depression” and “Fatigue/activities” from the HDRS correlated with the total HDRS. Certain PDAS dimensions were also associated with BPRS subscales, CGI and SAPS.

The DAS and all its dimensions except “Places/situations involved” correlated with the total BPRS (coefficient correlations from 0.31 to 0.51) and numerous BPRS dimensions. DAS was also associated with HDRS (r = 0.29, p = 0.05). DAS and all its dimensions were also associated with CGI and SAPS.

Discussion

The present study describes the first cross-cultural evaluation of the French versions of the DAS and PDAS, including the first factor analysis of the PDAS, and an assessment of the floor and ceiling effects of the DAS and PDAS, which was not performed in the original studies.

Our study population was comparable to those in other published reports with regard to most sociodemographic and medical characteristics [4, 15, 37–39]. Medical treatment of the patients was consistent with guidelines on pharmacotherapy in MDDPsy [7–11, 40]. The DAS, PDAS, HDRS-17 and BPRS-18 total scores were similar to those observed in studies validating the DAS and PDAS scales [15, 41, 42]. The participants in this multicenter study were recruited from both university and non-university hospitals and assessed by trained psychiatrists.

DAS

The French version of the DAS comprises five dimensions that differ from those of the original version. No item overlapped between the five factors. The first factor included six of the scale items, received the greatest loading, and accounted for 20% of variance. In comparison to the original DAS, the French version groups together the “Conviction” and “Impact” dimensions (except item 4). This is related to the observation of Meyers that there were some overlaps between the items of the “Conviction” and “Impact” dimensions from the original version of the DAS indicating a relationship between the constructs [15]. We decided to name this factor “Delusional conviction” to reflect the strength of the belief and of its emotional and behavioral impact. Factor 3 retains the two items of the “Bizarreness” factor from the original version. Factor 2 from the French version, “Disorganization/Mood congruence”, comprises five items and accounts for 19.5% of variance. Compared to the original version, it includes item 8, “People/objects involved”, and item 15, “Mood congruence” while factors 4 and 5 are each composed of a single item. Factor 4 from the DAS is made up solely of item 4, which assesses whether the patient is distrustful, and factor 5 of the PDAS is made up solely of BPRS item 11, which assesses the suspiciousness of the patient. These two dimensions are fairly independent of the other dimensions that make up the scales to which they belong and are well correlated with each other.

We applied the value of 15% for floor and ceiling effects [31]. The floor effect was observed for certain subscales, due partly perhaps to the absence of certain symptoms in our patients and partly to the construction of the scales: each item was rated from 1 to 3 with factor 3 comprising two items, and factors 4 and 5 one item each. This limits the response options even when responses are well distributed with items rated from 1 to 3.

The DAS had good internal consistency. The results obtained with the French version of the DAS were even better than those of the original version [15]. The internal consistency of the DAS scale as measured by the Cronbach α coefficient (0.81) was considered to be satisfactory and evidence of the good homogeneity of the scale. The Cronbach α coefficient scores of the three dimensions of the French version with enough items for the calculation (0.73, 0.78 and 0.80) were also considered acceptable. By comparison, the original DAS had an overall coefficient of 0.72 with a highest score of 0.85 for the Conviction dimension.

The DAS showed significant inter-item correlations, totaling 30/105 (r>0.30). We observed a satisfactory correlation (>0.60) between items 1 and 2 of dimension 1 of the French version of the DAS, the two items that make up the Conviction dimension of the original version and which were used as inclusion criteria in the STOP-PD therapeutic trial [16, 38, 43–46]. We also observed a satisfactory inter-item correlation (from 0.40 to 0.60) between items 10 and 11, which make up the Bizarreness dimension of the original and French versions of the DAS.

The DAS showed good item-total consistency except for item 15, “Mood congruence”, which forms a single dimension in the original version of the DAS and was added to Kendler’s dimensions of delusional experience, which provided the basis of the DAS [15].

Positive relationships were found between four of the five DAS dimensions: only factor 4, composed of the single item “Acting irrationally distrustful during interview”, did not correlate with any other. We cannot make a comparison with the original version of the DAS because, to the best of our knowledge, no such analysis has been published.

The DAS had good inter-judge reliability, with good scores for each of these dimensions. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.85 for dimension 1, which groups together the dimensions of Conviction and Impact from the original DAS, which in the study of Meyers, had the best ICC (respectively, 0.74 et 0.77). The ICC for dimension 2 was 0.94, which is an excellent score. This dimension groups together Disorganization (ICC of 0.37 in the study of Meyers), Mood Congruence (ICC of 0.51 in the study of Meyers) and one of the two items in Extension (ICC of 0.53 in the study of Meyers). According to Meyers, the reason for the weaker results for the dimensions of Disorganization and Extension was that “the raters have greater difficulty reliably assessing items that rate how delusions may change over time”. He therefore recommended that “future investigators limit the timeframe for the domains of Disorganization and Extension to the week preceding the interview” [15]. Our study was performed in accordance with this recommendation, which could explain the improved ICC score for dimension 2. Dimension 3, which corresponds to the “Bizarreness” factor of the original DAS, was the exception with an ICC score of 0.49, which is nevertheless acceptable, and higher than that of 0.46 recorded in the study of Meyers. It is evidence, as Meyers clearly explained in his study, of the difficulty in assessing this dimension in patients with MDDPsy. The construction of this dimension of the DAS derives from Kendler’s scale of dimensions of delusional experience, which was designed for patients with schizophrenia. Rating bizarreness can be more problematic in patients with MDDPsy and influenced by the investigator’s experience and subjective assessment.

The DAS and all its dimensions except “Places/situations involved” correlated with the total BPRS, with coefficient correlations ranging from 0.31 to 0.51, and with numerous BPRS dimensions. The result for the total DAS was greater than that in the study of Meyers (0.50 as against 0.4) and four of the five dimensions of the French version were significantly correlated with the total score of the BPRS, as against two dimensions in the study of Meyers [15]. The French version of the DAS therefore fully accounted for psychotic symptoms. DAS was also associated with HDRS (r = 0.29, p = 0.005), with a weaker but nevertheless acceptable coefficient.

PDAS

Surprisingly, despite a highly significant result, Mokken analysis did not confirm the scalability of the PDAS (Loevinger coefficient < 0.40). During validation of the semi-structured PDAS interview, Köse Çinar and Østergaard [41] also failed to demonstrate the scalability of the PDAS (Loevinger coefficient 0.17) at baseline. They stated that this could have been due to low variability in the PDAS scores (22.8 ± 5.7). Our data showed a score with low variability (21.8 ± 4.9) close to that in their study [41] whereas the original PDAS validation study showed a higher score and variability (29.5 ± 11.3) [47]. These differences in PDAS score and variability could be due to the population studied. Despite being subject to the same inclusion criteria as in the article of Østergaard [16], our participants had a lower HDRS score, more hallucinations, more suicide attempts and all were inpatients. Another explanation could be the extraction of PDAS items from complete HDRS-17 and BPRS-18. In our study the specific semi-structured interview for the PDAS was not used, which could have affected the rating of the scale. In general, studies assessing the scalability of the PDAS demonstrate its scalability [16, 42, 47] and even Köse Çinar and Østergaard found a Loevinger coefficient > 0.40 at endpoint of their study [41].

With regard to the PDAS, the six items from the HDRS were divided into two dimensions, 1 and 3, which accounted, respectively, for 18.1 and 13.0% of variance while the five items from the BPRS were divided into three dimensions, 2, 4 and 5, which accounted, respectively, for 17.3, 11.8 and 10.0% of variance. Factor 1, which received the greatest loading, is made up of all the items from the “Depression” score of the HDRS. Item HDRS 7 “Work and activities” overlapped between the two factors that make up the HDRS subscale of the PDAS. We decided to place this item in dimension 3 because the psychometric qualities of the scale are better in this configuration.

The moderate results of all internal validity and consistency tests confirmed the construct of the PDAS scale and its scalability.

The PDAS had good inter-judge reliability. Only the “Fatigue/activities” dimension of the PDAS showed an intraclass correlation coefficient very slightly lower than 0.70. The reason could be that, as in the STOP-PD trial, half of our study population were elderly, at an age when they often experience fatigue of various causes, not necessarily imputable to MDDPsy and therefore difficult to assess. Likewise, it is difficult to gauge the impact of MDDPsy on changes in activity of subjects whose habits and behavior are affected by retirement and other age-related factors.

The PDAS correlated with all other scales tested (HDRS, BPRS, CGI and SAPS) and several subscales. The French version of the PDAS reflects the severity of the disease and accounts for both depressive and psychotic symptoms. The strongest correlation was with the total BPRS (r = 0.82, p<0.0001). All the PDAS dimensions correlated with the total BPRS with correlation coefficients varying from 0.25 to 0.51 due to the fact that 5 of the 11 items of the PDAS, i.e. three of the five dimensions, came from the BPRS. Only the two dimensions, “Depression” and “Fatigue/activities”, from the HDRS correlated with the total HDRS, due to the fact that 6 of the 11 items of the PDAS, divided over two dimensions, derived from the HDRS.

One limitation of the present study is its failure to confirm the scalability of the PDAS scale. However, the results of internal validity and consistency tests tend towards confirmation. In addition, the good convergent validity and inter-judge reliability allow the scale to be used. However, inter-judge reliability was calculated from the assessments of only 26 patients, who had consented to a second interview. This relatively small number of volunteers can be explained by the symptoms of MDDPsy.

In conclusion, our study provides evidence of the good psychometric properties of the French versions of the DAS and PDAS. However, other studies are needed to confirm the scalability of the PDAS and the generalisability of the results to a larger population. This should help clinicians and researchers to assess cases of MDDPsy, which is a severe disorder, whose prognosis is marked by the risk of suicide and the lesser likelihood of patients achieving treatment response. The cross-cultural adaptation of this specific instrument should enable clinicians as of now to better assess the symptoms of MDDpsy, particularly psychotic features. It should also enable investigators to propose French-speaking persons with MDDPsy as participants in international collaboration research projects. In both cases, the response to treatment and prognosis of MDDPsy should be improved.

Reviewer #1: Major Depression with psychotic features (psychotic depression) is a serious illness for which the diagnosis is often missed. Two important rating scales have been developed to help clinicians diagnose this condition. The authors present data from a study to validate the French version of these two important scales that can aid clinicians in making an accurate diagosis -the PDAS and the DAS. The manuscript is well written and the data clearly presented. I had a few suggestions and questions which should be addressed:

1. page 6- "The PDAS Instrument" should be in BOLD.

2. page 9 - The frequency of hallucinations was rather high (45%) for patients with psychotic depression. Most studies report lower rates (around 5% I think). Furthermore, I note that 90% of the patients had delusions, not 100%). The DAS and the PDAS were developed from the Study of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression or STOP-PD. The investigators in that study required that the patients have a delusion. I also think their rate of hallucinations was much lower than your sample. The concern I have is that those patients who present with hallucinations without delusions may not have psychotic depression, but perhaps a different disorder, e.g. PTSD. I think you should point out the differences between your sample and the STOP-PD sample from which the 2 scales are based. Ideally, I would prefer to see an analysis on only patients who had a delusion (as in STOP-PD).

3. page 24- I believe you want to thank Barnett S. Meyers, M.D.

Reviewer #2: This validation of the French version of the DAS and PDAS is a valuable addition to the literature. There are however some methodological issues that must be solved prior to publication. I have the following suggestions for improvement:

1. Abstract/Introduction: Both the abstract and the introduction focuses on the underdiagnosis/lack of recognition of psychotic depression. While this is certainly a clinical problem, neither the DAS nor the PDAS were developed to aid diagnosis of psychotic depression, but rather to MEASURE delusions and the overall severity of psychotic depression. Hence, the underdiagnosis angle is somewhat misplaced. This reviewer suggests increased emphasis on measurement instead. This is also more in line with the aim of the study: “The present study aimed to validate French versions of the DAS and PDAS after evaluation of their psychometric properties for use in measuring the severity of psychotic depression in MDDPsy patients.”

2. Methods: “The psychiatrist completed the questionnaires after a routine interview

with patients shortly after hospital admission.” Which questionnaires? The DAS and PDAS are not questionnaires.

3. Methods: Some of the exclusion criteria are quite strict, e.g. “meeting criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder” and “history of drug or alcohol abuse in the past three months”. This has reduced the generalizability of the results and should be mentioned under the limitations. Relatedly, “taking a medication with known psychiatric effects” needs to be rephrased and explained.

4. Methods: The font size of the subtitle “The PDAS instrument” should be increased.

5. Methods: “In addition, there exist validated French versions of the scales [25,26].” Actuelly, there is a publicly available French version of the PDAS available: https://psychoticdepressionassessmentscale.com/french-pdas/

Have the authors used this version inclusing the semi-structured interview? If not, it should be specified. This interview has been used in the two most recent validations of the PDAS:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535843/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501075/

6. Methods: How was the “General somatic” item of the PDAS rated? In most studies of the PDAS, a rescaling of this item to a 0-4 range was made. This reviewer suggests that the same is done for the present study. Similarly, the BPRS should be rescaled to 0-4 in all analyses to allow for comparison with other studies. See e.g. Østergaard SD, Meyers BS, Flint AJ, Mulsant BH, Whyte EM, Ulbricht CM, et al. Measuring psychotic depression. Acta Psychiatr Scand. mars 2014;129(3):211‑20.

7. Methods: The authors place substantial emphasis on inter-item correlations, item-total correlations and inter-scale correlations. This reviewer is not convinced by the value of these analyses (such overlap can be a product of redundancy = items overlapping in content = the same psychopathology measured several times). Rather, the authors should focus on whether the individual items add unique information to the scale. This aspect (unidimensionality/scalability) is tested by item response theory analysis and the PDAS performs very well in this regard:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23799875/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535843/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501075/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25462426/

I therefore strongly suggest that the authors add item response theory analyses and decrease the emphasis on the inter-item correlations, item-total correlations and inter-scale correlations – as they are not particularly meaningful/informative from a psychometric perspective.

8. Results: “Almost half of the patients (45%) had hallucinations and almost all (90%) had

delusions.” Why do not all patients have a delusion – as dictated by the inclusion criteria:

“Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features on the basis of DSM 5 criteria [1], a delusional idea as defined in DSM-5 with a rating ≥3 (delusion definitely present) on the delusional rating item of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia[20].”

9. Discussion: Please be consistent in the use of decimal points: “With regard to the PDAS, the six items from the HDRS were divided into two dimensions, 1 and 3, which accounted, respectively, for 18.1 et 13% of variance; the five items from the BPRS were divided into three dimensions, 2, 4 and 5, which accounted, respectively, for 17.3, 11.8 et 10% of variance.”

10. Discussion: This is related to comment no. 7: “The absence of inter-dimension correlations in the PDAS shows that the dimensions are independent of one another. This could be related to the fact that factors 1 and 3 are composed of items from the HDRS and the other three factors of items from the BPRS. This method of construction of the PDAS could also explain the moderate corrected item-total and the weak inter-item correlations.” Yes – but this reviewer would argue that the lacking correlation is actually a significant strentgh of the PDAS. We do not want to measure the same psychopathology several times = redundancy = the total score of a scale is not meaningful. Please revise accordingly.

11. Discussion: “Further studies on diagnostic performance and responsiveness to change are needed before the French versions of the DAS and PDAS can be fully recommended to help guide the diagnosis or assess the efficacy of a treatment.” Again, The DAS and PDAS are not intended to be diagnostic tools. Furthermore, the responsiveness of the PDAS seems to be quite good:

Reviewer #1: Major Depression with psychotic features (psychotic depression) is a serious illness for which the diagnosis is often missed. Two important rating scales have been developed to help clinicians diagnose this condition. The authors present data from a study to validate the French version of these two important scales that can aid clinicians in making an accurate diagosis -the PDAS and the DAS. The manuscript is well written and the data clearly presented. I had a few suggestions and questions which should be addressed:

1. page 6- "The PDAS Instrument" should be in BOLD.

“The PDAS Instrument” has been bolded page 6.

2. page 9 - The frequency of hallucinations was rather high (45%) for patients with psychotic depression. Most studies report lower rates (around 5% I think). Furthermore, I note that 90% of the patients had delusions, not 100%). The DAS and the PDAS were developed from the Study of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression or STOP-PD. The investigators in that study required that the patients have a delusion. I also think their rate of hallucinations was much lower than your sample.

The concern I have is that those patients who present with hallucinations without delusions may not have psychotic depression, but perhaps a different disorder, e.g. PTSD. I think you should point out the differences between your sample and the STOP-PD sample from which the 2 scales are based. Ideally, I would prefer to see an analysis on only patients who had a delusion (as in STOP-PD).

We thank you for this remark which highlighted an important error when writing our article: as in STOP-PD, all patients had at least one clearly defined delusion and a score of ≥3 on the delusion severity rating item of the SADS (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia). This was an inclusion criteria in our study. Thus no patients had hallucinations without delusions and we confirmed that all patients had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features on the basis of DSM 5 criteria. We used the SAPS to classify the type of delusions and hallucinations but not to rate their severity. And the 90% patients with delusions and 45% with hallucinations were based on SAPS. We have removed theses muddled data from the article. However, we agreed that the proportion of our patients with hallucinations was superior to those observed in STOP-PD. Indeed, it could be due to difference in the population. Our BPRS, DAS and PDAS scores were similar to those in STOP-PD (Meyers et al. 2006) and to other article using PDAS (Köse Çinar et Østergaard 2018; Vermeulen et al. 2018). However, our patients had lower HDRS score (25.5 vs 29.8), had more depressive episodes (23% with a first episode in our study vs 30.1%), had more suicide attempts (32% vs 18.5) than patients in these studies. They are all inpatients (69% in STOP-PD, Meyers et al. 2009). This could be related to the higher proportion of our patients with hallucinations, as in a study of Gournellis (Gournellis et al. 2001) in which 36% of inpatients with psychotic depression had hallucinations.

As recommended, we pointed out these difference in the discussion.

Reviewer #2: This validation of the French version of the DAS and PDAS is a valuable addition to the literature. There are however some methodological issues that must be solved prior to publication. I have the following suggestions for improvement:

1. Abstract/Introduction: Both the abstract and the introduction focuses on the underdiagnosis/lack of recognition of psychotic depression. While this is certainly a clinical problem, neither the DAS nor the PDAS were developed to aid diagnosis of psychotic depression, but rather to MEASURE delusions and the overall severity of psychotic depression. Hence, the underdiagnosis angle is somewhat misplaced. This reviewer suggests increased emphasis on measurement instead. This is also more in line with the aim of the study: “The present study aimed to validate French versions of the DAS and PDAS after evaluation of their psychometric properties for use in measuring the severity of psychotic depression in MDDPsy patients.”

Modifications have been done as recommended in the abstract and in the introduction sections (pages 3 and 4).

2. Methods: “The psychiatrist completed the questionnaires after a routine interview

with patients shortly after hospital admission.” Which questionnaires? The DAS and PDAS are not questionnaires.

We agreed with you remark and replaced “questionnaires” by “the DAS and PDAS scales”.

3. Methods: Some of the exclusion criteria are quite strict, e.g. “meeting criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder” and “history of drug or alcohol abuse in the past three months”. This has reduced the generalizability of the results and should be mentioned under the limitations. Relatedly, “taking a medication with known psychiatric effects” needs to be rephrased and explained.

The exclusion criteria, as the inclusion criteria, were the same that those used in the STOP-PD study (Meyers et al. 2006; 2009). We agreed that this reduced the generalizability of the results and we mentioned it in the limitations. The terms “taking a medication with known psychiatric effects” were from the article of Meyers et al. (2006) which presented the DAS scale. This term has been changed “taking a medication which may induce psychiatric symptoms or disorders”.

4. Methods: The font size of the subtitle “The PDAS instrument” should be increased.

“The PDAS Instrument” has been bolded in the methods.

5. Methods: “In addition, there exist validated French versions of the scales [25,26].” Actuelly, there is a publicly available French version of the PDAS available: https://psychoticdepressionassessmentscale.com/french-pdas/

Have the authors used this version inclusing the semi-structured interview? If not, it should be specified. This interview has been used in the two most recent validations of the PDAS:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535843/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501075/

When the study started, the French version of the semi-structured interview for the PDAS was not available. For the PDAS, we used the complete HDRS and BPRS scales (and interviews) from which specific items of the PDAS were extracted. We added this specification in the assessment section of the method.

6. Methods: How was the “General somatic” item of the PDAS rated? In most studies of the PDAS, a rescaling of this item to a 0-4 range was made. This reviewer suggests that the same is done for the present study. Similarly, the BPRS should be rescaled to 0-4 in all analyses to allow for comparison with other studies. See e.g. Østergaard SD, Meyers BS, Flint AJ, Mulsant BH, Whyte EM, Ulbricht CM, et al. Measuring psychotic depression. Acta Psychiatr Scand. mars 2014;129(3):211 20.

We thank you for this relevant remark. BPRS scores had not been rescaled; we did it and we have presented the update results in this new version. The descriptive statistics and score distributions of the PDAS (in the table 4) are the most impacted results.

7. Methods: The authors place substantial emphasis on inter-item correlations, item-total correlations and inter-scale correlations. This reviewer is not convinced by the value of these analyses (such overlap can be a product of redundancy = items overlapping in content = the same psychopathology measured several times). Rather, the authors should focus on whether the individual items add unique information to the scale. This aspect (unidimensionality/scalability) is tested by item response theory analysis and the PDAS performs very well in this regard:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23799875/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535843/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501075/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25462426/

I therefore strongly suggest that the authors add item response theory analyses and decrease the emphasis on the inter-item correlations, item-total correlations and inter-scale correlations – as they are not particularly meaningful/informative from a psychometric perspective.

We thank the reviewer for the helpful and relevant comment. We agree that other approaches like that item response theory can be useful and informative for the analysis of the construct validity, especially for PDAS. According to the reviewer’s comment and to the COSMIN recommendations, this statistical analysis was conducted. The Loevinger coefficient has been estimated. As described in the revised manuscript, Loevinger coefficients of homogeneity derived from the Mokken analyses are 0.39 and 0.28 for DAS and PDAS scales, respectively. The predefined threshold for scalability (≥0.40) was not achieved although significant results (both < 0.001).

8. Results: “Almost half of the patients (45%) had hallucinations and almost all (90%) had

delusions.” Why do not all patients have a delusion – as dictated by the inclusion criteria:

“Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features on the basis of DSM 5 criteria [1], a delusional idea as defined in DSM-5 with a rating ≥3 (delusion definitely present) on the delusional rating item of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia[20].”

We thank you for this remark which highlighted an important error when writing our article: as in STOP-PD, all patients had at least one clearly defined delusion and a score of ≥3 on the delusion severity rating item of the SADS (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia). This was an inclusion criteria. We used the SAPS to classify the type of delusions and hallucinations but not to rate their severity. The 90% patients with delusions and 45% with hallucinations were based on SAPS. We have removed theses muddled data from the article.

9. Discussion: Please be consistent in the use of decimal points: “With regard to the PDAS, the six items from the HDRS were divided into two dimensions, 1 and 3, which accounted, respectively, for 18.1 et 13% of variance; the five items from the BPRS were divided into three dimensions, 2, 4 and 5, which accounted, respectively, for 17.3, 11.8 et 10% of variance.”

Modifications have been done page 20:

“With regard to the PDAS, the six items from the HDRS were divided into two dimensions, 1 and 3, which accounted, respectively, for 18.1 et 13.0% of variance; the five items from the BPRS were divided into three dimensions, 2, 4 and 5, which accounted, respectively, for 17.3, 11.8 et 10.0% of variance.”

10. Discussion: This is related to comment no. 7: “The absence of inter-dimension correlations in the PDAS shows that the dimensions are independent of one another. This could be related to the fact that factors 1 and 3 are composed of items from the HDRS and the other three factors of items from the BPRS. This method of construction of the PDAS could also explain the moderate corrected item-total and the weak inter-item correlations.” Yes – but this reviewer would argue that the lacking correlation is actually a significant strentgh of the PDAS. We do not want to measure the same psychopathology several times = redundancy = the total score of a scale is not meaningful. Please revise accordingly.

We thank the reviewer for the interesting comment. We perfectly agree. Interestingly, the complementary statistical analyses based on item response theory suggested by the reviewer confirmer the remark that the lacking correlation can be seen as a significant strength of the PDAS. The discussion have been revised as recommended.

11. Discussion: “Further studies on diagnostic performance and responsiveness to change are needed before the French versions of the DAS and PDAS can be fully recommended to help guide the diagnosis or assess the efficacy of a treatment.” Again, The DAS and PDAS are not intended to be diagnostic tools. Furthermore, the responsiveness of the PDAS seems to be quite good:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24439830/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501075/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535843/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25462426/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26496016/

The limitation section of the abstract and the discussion page 24 have been modified as recommended

“Limitations: Interjudge reliability was calculated from a relatively small number of volunteers.”

“The present study has certain limitations. Interjudge reliability was calculated from the assessments of 26 patients who had consented to a second interview. This relatively small number of volunteers can be explained by the symptoms of MDDPsy. In addition we did not perform studies of responsiveness to change or of diagnostic performance.”

The conclusion have also been modified as recommended:

“In conclusion, our study provides evidence of the good psychometric properties of the French versions of the DAS and PDAS. However, other studies are warranted to confirm the scalability of the PDAS and the generalizability of the results to more extensive population. This should help clinicians and researchers to assess cases of MDDPsy, which is a severe disorder, whose prognosis is marked by the risk of suicide and the lesser likelihood of patients achieving treatment response. The cross-cultural adaptation of this specific instrument should enable clinicians as of now to better assess the symptoms of MDDpsy, particularly psychotic features. It should also enable investigators to propose French-speaking persons with MDDPsy as participants in international collaboration research projects. In both cases, the response to treatment and prognosis of MDDPsy should be improved.”

Reviewer #1: The authors have addressed my comments and concerns.

The authors have addressed my comments and concerns.

Reviewer #2: The authors are to be commended for the thorough work on the revision. This reviewer has the following suggestions for further improvement:

1. General: The language is somewhat suboptimal in certain sections. A proofread by a native English speaker could solve this quite easily.

2. Abstract: "The predefined threshold for scalability (≥0.40) was not achieved for both scales." This should be accompanied by information on the relative lack of variability in the data.

3. Methods: A Mokken analysis of the two PDAS subscales (HAM-D6 and BPRS5) would be of interest given the results of the primary analysis (rather low coefficient of homogeneity).

4. Methods: How were PDAS ratings "formatted" for the Mokken analysis (rescaled or)?

5. Discussion: "Surprisingly, despite a highly significant result, the Mokken analysis did not confirm the scalability of the PDAS (Loevinger coefficient < 0.40). During the validation of the semi-structured PDAS interview, Köse Çinar and Østergaard [42] also failed to demonstrate the scalability of the PDAS (Loevinger coefficient 0.17) at baseline. They mentioned that it may be due to low variability in PDAS scores (22.8 ± 5.7)."

Yes - but at endpoint in the Köse Çinar and Østergaard study - the Loevinger coefficient was 0.45. This needs to be underlined (fits the explanation). I also think that it deserves mentioning that all four studies having previously assessed the scalability of the PDAS, have confirmed the scalability of the instrument:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23799875/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501075/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25462426/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535843/

This leads this reviewer to think, that the present sample of patients is "qualitatively different" from prior studies (see also comment 6B below).

6. Discussion: "Our data showed similar score with low variability (21.8 ± 4.9), compared to the original PDAS validation which showed higher score and variability (29.5 ± 11.3) [48]. These differences in PDAS score and variability may be due to the population. Despite the same inclusion criteria than the article of Østergaard [17], our population had lower HDRS score, more hallucinations, more suicide attempts and are all inpatients."

A: What is meant by "similar score" here?

B: "These differences in PDAS score and variability may be due to the population. Despite the same inclusion criteria than the article of Østergaard [17], our population had lower HDRS score, more hallucinations, more suicide attempts"

This description leads this reviewer to think that there may be a fraction of the participants suffering from either a primary psychotic disorder (ICD-10: F20) or PTSD (as also suggested by one of the other reviewers).

Reviewer #2: The authors are to be commended for the thorough work on the revision. This reviewer has the following suggestions for further improvement:

1. General: The language is somewhat suboptimal in certain sections. A proofread by a native English speaker could solve this quite easily.

The manuscript has been proofread by a native English speaker.

2. Abstract: "The predefined threshold for scalability (≥0.40) was not achieved for both scales." This should be accompanied by information on the relative lack of variability in the data.

The mention of the lack of variability in the data has been added in the abstract to explain that scalability was not demonstrated for the scales: “Owing to low score variability between patients, the predefined threshold for scalability (≥0.40) was not reached for both scales.”.

3. Methods: A Mokken analysis of the two PDAS subscales (HAM-D6 and BPRS5) would be of interest given the results of the primary analysis (rather low coefficient of homogeneity).

The Loevinger coefficients of homogeneity derived from the Mokken analyses were 0.39 for HAM-D6 and 0.33 for BPRS5. They were lower than those observed in the original PDAS validation study (0.51 and 0.40 respectively) .

4. Methods: How were PDAS ratings "formatted" for the Mokken analysis (rescaled or)?

The instructions given in the original article were followed: “The BPRS item scores (from 1 to 7) were converted to a score between 0 and 4 according to this formula: (BPRS score – 1) x 2/3. For the Mokken analysis, which requires data on a numeric scale, the BPRS scores were converted as follows: 1 = 0, 2–3 = 1, 4-5 = 2, 6 = 3, and 7 = 4. In all analyses of the seven composite scales, the rating on Hamilton item 13 (general somatic) was multiplied by 2”.

We agree that the method section of our article was not clear enough and we therefore differentiated the method of calculating the total score in the presentation of the PDAS section and that used for the Mokken analysis in the statistical analyses section:

The PDAS instrument

“The total PDAS score is obtained by adding up the sum of the individual item scores after converting the BPRS item scores to a score between 0 and 4 with the formula (BPRS score – 1) x 2/3, and multiplying the score for item 13 on the Hamilton scale (general somatic) by 2.”

Statistical analyses

“(i) Scalability was assessed by Mokken analysis, generating a Loevinger coefficient of homogeneity for the PDAS total score. In the Mokken analysis, a Loevinger coefficient of homogeneity ≥0.40 is indicative of scalability [32]. For the present analysis the BPRS scores were converted as follows: 1 = 0, 2–3 = 1, 4-5 = 2, 6 = 3, and 7 = 4.”

5. Discussion: "Surprisingly, despite a highly significant result, the Mokken analysis did not confirm the scalability of the PDAS (Loevinger coefficient < 0.40). During the validation of the semi-structured PDAS interview, Köse Çinar and Østergaard [42] also failed to demonstrate the scalability of the PDAS (Loevinger coefficient 0.17) at baseline. They mentioned that it may be due to low variability in PDAS scores (22.8 ± 5.7)."

Yes - but at endpoint in the Köse Çinar and Østergaard study - the Loevinger coefficient was 0.45. This needs to be underlined (fits the explanation). I also think that it deserves mentioning that all four studies having previously assessed the scalability of the PDAS, have confirmed the scalability of the instrument:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23799875/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501075/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25462426/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535843/

This leads this reviewer to think, that the present sample of patients is "qualitatively different" from prior studies (see also comment 6B below).

This section has been completed as requested: “In general, studies assessing the scalability of the PDAS demonstrate its scalability [16,42,47] and even Köse Çinar and Østergaard found a Loevinger coefficient > 0.40 at endpoint of their study [41].”

6. Discussion: "Our data showed similar score with low variability (21.8 ± 4.9), compared to the original PDAS validation which showed higher score and variability (29.5 ± 11.3) [48]. These differences in PDAS score and variability may be due to the population. Despite the same inclusion criteria than the article of Østergaard [17], our population had lower HDRS score, more hallucinations, more suicide attempts and are all inpatients." Voir texte modifié

A: What is meant by "similar score" here?

The sentence has been changed to be clearer: “Our data showed a score with low variability (21.8 ± 4.9) close to that in their study [41] whereas the original PDAS validation study showed a higher score and variability (29.5 ± 11.3) [47].”

B: "These differences in PDAS score and variability may be due to the population. Despite the same inclusion criteria than the article of Østergaard [17], our population had lower HDRS score, more hallucinations, more suicide attempts"

This description leads this reviewer to think that there may be a fraction of the participants suffering from either a primary psychotic disorder (ICD-10: F20) or PTSD (as also suggested by one of the other reviewers).

Psychotic features in depressive disorder should be distinguished from delusional ideas and hallucinations that occur in schizophrenia, and flashbacks in PTSD should be distinguished from hallucinations that can occur in depressive disorder with psychotic features. Several other symptoms support the differential diagnosis between depressive disorder with psychotic features and schizophrenia or PTSD. As our patients were hospitalized in psychiatric units, they were assessed by hospital psychiatrists independent of the study who made a diagnosis during care. For recruitment, we specified that the patients who could be invited to participate in the study were those with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features. In addition, the study psychiatrist systematically checked the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

In our study, the hallucinations and the lower educational level of patients are correlated (please see attached table). This is consistent with the literature (Jääskeläinen E et al, 2018 ). In our study, 70 of the 94 patients were recruited from the psychiatric hospital centres of Clermont-Ferrand and Le Puy en Velay. These hospital centres treat patients with a lower educational level (only 17% of these patients spent more than 12 years in school) who often live in rural communities. The educational level of our patients was lower than the average educational level of patients in the studies of Meyers et al (2006) and SC Park et al (2014). This point has been emphasized in the conclusion: “However, other studies are needed to confirm the scalability of the PDAS and the generalisability of the results to a larger population.”
