A supplemental analysis in the final paper involved an independent replication dataset. This replication dataset describes a sub-sample of patients diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia which was collected as part of a larger project in collaboration with Dr. Chris Pittenger. In addition, Dr. Youngsun T. Cho played a key role in coordinating the data collection and management of this project. We are therefore formally correcting the eLife paper to include both Dr. Pittenger and Dr. Cho as co-authors on this paper. Both have reviewed the manuscript and support the conclusions, and agree to be responsible for all parts of the paper in its published form.

The details of Dr. Pittenger and Dr. Cho’s contributions are explained below:

Dr. Pittenger and Dr. Cho provided key support in the data acquisition and coordination of the project from which the independent replication dataset was obtained. This replication dataset involved a subsample of data with OCD and schizophrenia that were collected as part of a larger study in collaboration with Dr. Pittenger. Dr. Cho was also integral for the project management of this study. Both Dr. Pittenger and Dr. Cho have reviewed the manuscript and its conclusions.
