==== Body
1. Introduction
It was shown that substituted 1,3,4-thiadiazoles exhibit antimicrobial [1] and antitubercular [2,3,4] activities, while other compounds act on the CNS as anticonvulsants [5,6,7] or as antidepressant and anxiolitic [8] agents. A family of selective 1,3,4-thiadiazole phosphodiesterase inhibitors [9], and selective orally active cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [10] were reported. Moreover, many reports indicate that acylthiosemicarbazides and their corresponding cyclized 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives possess anti-inflammatory [11,12,13] and analgesic [14] activities. 1,3,4-Thiadiazoles are thus a group of heterocycles whose derivatives are important in industry, medicine and agriculture [13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Accordingly, in continuation of our work in this area [22,23,24,25,26,27], a variety of heterocyclic derivatives have been prepared from saccharide derivatives, involving some new thiadiazoles, oxathiadiazoles, and their chemistry and effect of the derivatives on the enzyme tyrosinase was studied [28,29,30,31], which is the rate limiting step in melanin biosynthesis [32]. In humans, the main role of the melanins is photoprotection of the skin by absorbing UV radiation that causes DNA damage and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Human deficiency in melanin causes serious disorders like oculocutaneous albinism and vitiligo. There has also been great interest in the involvement of melanins in malignant melanosomes, the carcinogenic tumors of the skin. Melanoma is most commonly found on the skin, but around 10% arise in the eyes [33].

In addition, tyrosinase is involved in dopamine biosynthesis, which has been shown to be involved in the control of movements, and the signaling of errors in the prediction of reward, motivation, and cognition. Cerebral dopamine depletion is the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease [31]. Other pathological states have also been associated with dopamine dysfunction, such as schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [32].

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Chemistry
Ethyl 5-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutyl)-2-methylfuran-3-carboxylate (1) [34] was prepared, then boiled with hydrazine hydrate to give carbohydrazide 2 [35], which when condensed with a variety of ketones afforded carbohydrazides 3–6 in 64–96% yield (Scheme 1).

The structure of hydrazones 3–6 was proven by their 1H-NMR spectra, which showed the NH proton as a singlet at δ 9.87–9.20, the proton at position-4 in the furan ring as a singlet at 7.27–6.57 ppm, the 1'-OH proton at 5.06–5.05 and the rest of the sugar protons at the 4.58–4.28 range. The methyl protons at position-2 in the furan ring appeared as a singlet at δ 2.44–2.21 ppm; additionally the disappearance of the two NH2 protons was observed (see Experimental). It was observed that the C-1' hydroxyl proton of compounds 3–6, resonates at lower field (5.06–5.05 ppm) than the rest of the sugar protons. Electronic deshielding by the adjacent base residue undoubtedly is a major factor in causing these signals to appear at low field. Additional deshielding might also arise through the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the furan ring. Hydrogen bonding of this type was suggested in polyhydroxyalkyltriazole analogs [36] and polyhydroxyalkylpyrazolo-[3,4-b]-quinoxalines [37] having the D-arabino configuration of the side chain. In addition, the mass spectra of compounds 5 and 6, as examples of the series, showed the corresponding molecular ion peaks at m/z 377 and 342, respectively. On the other hand, acetylation of 3–5 afforded the corresponding acetyl derivatives 7–9 in 45–86% yield (Scheme 1).

molecules-17-08378-scheme1_Scheme 1Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives. 

The 1H-NMR spectra of compound 8 and 9 showed the disappearance of the OH protons in the sugar region, the O-acetyl protons at δ 2.43 and 2.23 ppm, respectively, and peaks at 2.59, 2.03 for the N- acetyl protons, respectively (for the other protons see the Experimental). Periodate oxidation of compounds 3–6 afforded the corresponding formyl derivatives 10–13, in 36–65% yields (Scheme 1).

1H-NMR spectra of compounds 10–12 showed the NH proton as a singlet at δ 9.32, 8.91 and 9.36 ppm. respectively, and the formyl group proton as a singlet at δ 9.87, 9.34, and 9.44 ppm, respectively (for other protons see the Experimental). The mass spectrum of compound 13, showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 250, which was also the base peak. 

Acid catalyzed condensation of thiosemicarbazide or o-tolylthiosemicarbazide with the prepared formyl derivatives 10–12 gave thiosemicarbazone derivatives 14–19 in 43–99% yield (Scheme 1). The mass spectra of compounds 14, 16–18 showed the molecular ion peaks at m/z 343, 358, 433 and 449 respectively. Cyclization of the prepared compounds 14–19 with acetic anhydride afforded 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives 20–25 in 40–73% yield (Scheme 1).

The 1H-NMR spectra of compounds 20–22 showed the disappearance of the NH2 protons and CH=N proton. Instead, the N-Ac methyl protons appeared as a singlet. Interestingly, it was noted that the 1H-NMR spectra of compounds 21 and 22 showed the proton at position-4 in the furan ring as a doublet signal at δ 6.69 and 7.22 instead of a singlet signal due to the long rang interaction between H-furan and the NH proton of the amide group. However a theoretical study of the NMR of compound 21 was attempted whereby the stable conformer of this compound was first established using the universal force field UFF molecular mechanics method (Table 1). After that the {B3LYP/6-31G (d)} density functional approach was used to fine tune the geometry of the compound. The Orca computational chemistry program was used in this step. According to the calculation the distance between the NH proton and the H-furan is equal to 2.304 Å, which is the same value of the distance between the methylene protons and the methyl protons in the ethanol molecule. In the same way, H-furan appeared as a doublet due to the coupling interaction with the NH proton, while the proton of the NH group appears as a singlet, so the question is why the interaction with the H-furan didn't affect the signal of (NH) proton. This is attributed to the ionization factor [38] (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

The mass spectra of compounds 20 and 22 showed the molecular ion peaks at m/z 427 and 526, respectively. The mass spectrum of compound 23 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 560. In addition, condensation of p-tosylhydrazine with the formyl derivatives 10–12 afforded p-tosylhydrazone derivatives 26–28 respectively in 42–83% yield (Scheme 2). The 1H-NMR spectra of compounds 26 and 27 showed the disappearance of the aldehyde proton. The two NH protons showed as a singlet at δ 9.36, 9.71, and 9.36, 10.47, respectively, the CH3 protons of the p-tolyl moiety as a singlet at δ 2.36 and 2.32 ppm, respectively (see Experimental part). The mass spectra of compounds 26 and 27 showed the molecular ion peaks at m/z 438 and 454, respectively.

Similarly, cyclization of these hydrazones 26–28, with acetic anhydride afforded 1,2,3,4-oxathiadiazole derivatives 29–31 in 32–54% yield (Scheme 2). The 1H-NMR spectra of the compounds 29 and 31 showed the disappearance of both the CH=N and the NHSO2 proton signals. The 1H-NMR spectra showed the CH3 protons of the p-tolyl group as a singlet at δ 2.40, 2.49 ppm, the CH3-C=N protons as a singlet at δ 2.05, 2.09 and the CH3-furan protons as a singlet at δ 2.40, 2.49, respectively. The mass spectra of compounds 29 and 30 showed the molecular ion peaks at m/z 420 and 478, respectively.
