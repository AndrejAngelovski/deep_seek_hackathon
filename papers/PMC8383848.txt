Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often live with and develop multiple co-occurring conditions, namely multimorbidity, with diffuse impacts on clinical care and patient quality of life. However, literature characterizing T2DM-related multimorbidity patterns is limited. This review summarizes the findings from the emerging literature characterizing and quantifying the association of T2DM with multimorbidity clusters. The authors’ findings reveal 3 dominant cluster types appearing in patients with T2DM-related multimorbidity, such as cardiometabolic precursor conditions, vascular conditions, and mental health conditions. The authors recommend that holistic patient care centers around early detection of other comorbidities and consideration of wider risk factors.

pmcKey points

• Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at high risk of living with multiple co-occurring conditions.

• Clustering studies show common comorbidities in patients with T2DM are hypertension, lipid disorders, cardiovascular-related conditions (eg, coronary heart disease), microvascular conditions, and depression.

• Generally, individuals who are older, who are female, and who live in more deprived areas are at more risk of having T2DM-related multimorbidity.

• Applying clustering insights alongside other approaches can allow for risk stratification and guide implementation of interventions.

• Clinicians should consider the holistic health needs of individuals living with T2DM, particularly surrounding mental health.

Introduction

The Challenge of Type 2 Diabetes-Related Multimorbidity

Managing the rising prevalence of chronic conditions is a key challenge for health systems worldwide.1 The co-occurrence of 2 or more chronic conditions is known as multimorbidity (Box 1) and is associated with reduced quality of life, impaired functional status, and increased burden on limited health care resources.2,3 Multimorbidity is a growing problem not only for high-income countries (HICs) but also for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) who make up 77% of global deaths due to non-communicable diseases, of which 85% are premature deaths.4 Some pooled prevalence estimates of global multimorbidity reveal that currently HICs have the highest prevalence (37.9%), whereas LMICs follow closely behind (29.7%)5 and are expected to increase over the following years.6 By 2035, approximately 17% of the UK population is projected to have 4 or more chronic conditions, almost double the prevalence (9.8%) in 2018.7 Previous studies have revealed social inequalities in multimorbidity, demonstrating earlier onset of multiple chronic conditions in patients living in the most deprived areas compared with the most affluent.8,9 This global progression in emerging multimorbidity will have widespread implications for patients, health systems, and governments.Box 1 Glossary of key terms

Comorbidity refers to a condition that co-occurs with another condition, with implied reference to an index condition.

Multimorbidity refers to the co-occurrence of 2 or more chronic conditions. The difference between comorbidity and multimorbidity is that the former requires an index condition to contextualize the condition, whereas the latter does not assign or differentiate importance on any 1 condition but considers the overall state of having multiple co-occurring conditions.

Concordant comorbidities are conditions that share a pathophysiologic pathway with the index condition of concern (eg, in the case of T2DM as an index condition, a concordant complication is chronic kidney disease or liver disease).

Discordant comorbidities are conditions that do not share a currently known pathophysiologic pathway with the index condition of concern (eg, in the case of T2DM as index condition, a discordant complication is osteoarthritis).

Cluster analyses are statistical approaches that aim to assign a set of objects (or data points) into a defined number of groups, known as clusters, so that objects in the same group possess more similar traits than other objects in other groups.

Patients with diabetes are more likely to develop multiple conditions compared with those without diabetes.10 This greater risk reflects the fundamental impact that extended exposure to elevated glucose and insulin resistance have on multiple organ systems, most notably through its effects on microvasculature, macrovasculature, and immune response. These effects in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) lead to an approximate doubling of risk for myocardial infarction, a 5-fold increased risk of renal failure, and more than a 10-fold increased risk of amputation and blindness.11 However, the impact on multiple conditions is also partly due to declining mortalities, increased life expectancy, and differing trends in cause-specific mortality, leading to a diversification in cause of death and complications.12 Thus, even in the face of declining risk of complications over time, people with T2DM live longer to experience more events and more conditions contributing to multimorbidity. The rising number of young people with T2DM is of particular concern, as earlier onset leads to a longer duration of disease and consequently more years lived with a greater risk for developing other conditions.13 Early onset of T2DM can lead to a more disruptive natural history and worsened quality of life,14 consequently, having adverse societal effects on labor markets and significant productivity losses.15,16 This review aims to explore how the commonly reported clusters of T2DM-related multimorbidity are characterized in the current literature.

Shifting the Morbidity Discourse

Historically, health systems have viewed single conditions in siloes as opposed to focusing on the holistic health needs of patients. Similarly, research to identify risk factors and effective prevention and treatment approaches has generally focused on single disease processes, posing challenges in the areas of multimorbidity surveillance, effective interventions, and the interface between care pathways. Thus, most health systems are not fully designed nor sufficiently equipped to provide tailored care to patients with multiple conditions.17 However, greater awareness and concern about multimorbidity have led to an emerging literature, moving away from simply counting conditions to instead measuring impact on patients and systems.18,19 Therefore, it is essential that multimorbidity research aims to consider all stages of the life course and focus on complex health states where the burden of multiple conditions is greater than the sum of its parts.20

There are far-reaching impacts of T2DM-related multimorbidity, which have implications not only for patients but also for families, community, and the health system (Fig. 1). Multimorbidity leads to multifaceted demands at the health system level; increased and sustained interactions with health care providers,3 adverse events owing to polypharmacy, and nonoptimally integrated care pathways all contribute to the complexity of planning care for multimorbid patients.21 This complexity calls for a multitiered approach guided by research that first seeks to understand the patterns of conditions that characterize multimorbidity, the implications for treatments, and how they change over time.Fig. 1 Multilevel impact of T2DM-related multimorbidity.

Development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus–Related Multimorbidity

Risk factors of T2DM are shared with other non-communicable diseases, such as vascular conditions and cancers, which can increase the risk of developing further comorbidities. For example, the overlap of risk factors, such as obesity and dyslipidemia, means individuals with T2DM are at higher risk for cardiovascular complications.22, 23, 24 The progression to a multimorbid state is dependent on the contributions of many distal and proximal factors within the wider system context, which can occur at any stage and severity of T2DM (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 Framework of the development of T2DM-related multimorbidity.

Comorbidities contributing to T2DM-related multimorbidity are both systemic yet heterogenous and can be classified as the following:a. Traditional complications include microvascular (eg, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular (eg, heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease) conditions.25

b. Nontraditional concordant comorbidities share common risk factors and pathophysiologic pathways but have not traditionally been considered part of T2DM sequelae, such as liver disease and cancers10,26 (see Box 1), in part because they are less specific or have a lower magnitude of association with T2DM compared with traditional complications.

c. Emerging discordant comorbidities do not, at present, have a clear etiologic link with T2DM but are found to commonly co-occur, such as depression and asthma, which have garnered increasing interest in the literature because of effects on mortality, morbidity outcomes, and health-related quality of life.26,27

Most of the current literature on T2DM complications has examined comorbidities individually from cohort studies and registries followed over time. However, this body of literature has not fully assessed how multiple conditions form distinct groups and patterns of co-occurrence, and over time. Thus, to inform this synthesis, the authors have conducted a systematic review of the selected studies that have examined the association of T2DM with clusters of multimorbidity. These patterns can be identified using population-based analytical approaches, such as cluster analyses (see Box 1), on T2DM patients.

Methods

This review aimed to identify population-based observational studies with a focus on T2DM among adults as the index condition, and that produced some type of cluster or grouping in their results. The authors identified 1714 records from Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Medline, Ovid Global Health, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from January 2000 to August 2020. Studies that simply listed a few limited preselected comorbidities without any indication of clustering or grouping were excluded. After multiple rounds of screening (Fig. 3), 91 studies were fully read, leaving 12 eligible studies.Fig. 3 PRISMA inclusion flowchart.

Results

The final 12 studies included came from varying HIC settings except for 2 conducted in China28,29 and adopted a range of different methods that varied in analytical statistical depth (Table 1). From the sample, the earliest study was conducted in 2012,30 with most of the remaining studies produced after 2015.Table 1 Characteristics of all included studies

As the format of the study results was heterogenous, owing to the varied methods used, the authors have summarized studies by 2 broad categories: (a) those employing combination groupings of co-occurring conditions (ie, pairs and triads) to define multimorbidity (Table 2); and (b) those studies of more complex statistical clustering methods (Table 3). The key clustering approaches used in the reviewed studies included agglomerative24,31 and divisive32 hierarchical clustering,28 latent class analysis,29,33 and graph theory,34 all of which require substantially large health data sets. Moreover, novel machine learning approaches have been used to characterize and learn multimorbidity patterns,35,36 but these methods are yet to be applied to T2DM specifically. Although the study approaches and settings were varied, predictors and predominant groups of conditions across clusters were identified and are discussed in the following sections.Table 2 Summary of results from studies adopting combination groupings

2. Individuals with only concordant comorbidities

3. Individuals with at least 1 discordant physical comorbidity excluding those with mental comorbidities

4. Individuals with at least 1 mental comorbidity

	The mean number of chronic comorbidities was higher in patients with mental comorbidity (5.5) compared with those with discordant physical comorbidity (4.1) or only concordant comorbidity (1.7)
Within the groups of patients with discordant and mental comorbidity, 85.3% and 87.1% had at least 1 concordant comorbidity and 2.8% and 1.3% had >3 concordant comorbidities, respectively

Who Is at Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus–Related Multimorbidity?

Age and deprivation are the leading drivers of multimorbidity, as the prevalence and number of comorbidities increase with older age in patients with T2DM.28,33,37 For example, the proportion of those with “complex” multimorbidity, defined as 4+ comorbidities, increases from 25% among persons less than 65 years to 42% among those aged 65 to 74 years, and 49% among those 75+ years of age.37 Patients older than 65 years and living with T2DM for 10+ years had a higher multimorbidity burden, characterized by end-organ complications, such as myocardial infarction and end-stage renal disease.33 Interestingly, clusters containing obesity were much more common in younger adults compared with those older than 65 years.38 Increasing deprivation level was strongly and consistently associated with an increasing proportion of patients with T2DM and a greater number of concurrent comorbidities31; the age-standardized prevalence of 1 or more comorbid conditions was 33.3% for the least-deprived areas and 32.7% for the most-deprived areas.24 For 4 or more chronic conditions, the age-standardized prevalence was 2.9% in the most affluent areas and 4.4% in the most deprived areas.24

Women have a proportionally greater burden of multimorbidity than their male counterparts in some studies,24,29,31,33 although the magnitude of this association is modest and inconsistent. A greater proportion of women presented with 4+ co-occurring comorbidities than men (18% vs 15.9%),31 with postmenopausal women experiencing the greatest risk of developing further comorbidities.29 However, a US study found that although more women had 1 or 2 comorbidities, more men had 3 or 4 comorbidities.37 In addition, there was little effect of sex on comorbidity number among patients aged 65+.39

Studies of T2DM-related multimorbidity clustering have not yet examined the relationship with common physiologic risk factors commonly associated with T2DM complications, such as elevated HbA1c, blood pressure, and levels of obesity.

How Are Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus–Related Multimorbidity Clusters Characterized?

Most reviewed studies were cross-sectional in nature, characterizing multimorbidity among patients at a specific point in time, with some studying patients with varying duration of T2DM. Across studies, 3 types of condition clusters appeared consistently, namely, (a) cardiometabolic precursor conditions, (b) vascular conditions, and (c) mental health conditions.

Across 6 diverse study settings, cardiometabolic precursor conditions, such as disorders of lipid metabolism, obesity, and hypertension, were the most common conditions at diagnosis.24,32,37, 38, 39 Hypertension was consistently the most common condition in multimorbid combinations and clusters.24,31,32,37, 38, 39 In individuals with 2 comorbid conditions in addition to T2DM, hypertension was commonly found alongside hyperlipidemia (67.5%),37 arthritis (20%), and anxiety (6.8%).37,39 Among individuals with 3 conditions in addition to T2DM, 51% had some combination of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity.38

The authors identified similar clusters of conditions that predominantly contained concordant cardiovascular and microvascular conditions usually associated with later-stage disease, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).24,28,29,31 Cardiovascular conditions were the most prevalent comorbidity type at diagnosis (64%)30 and constituted the second most prevalent triad alongside hypertension.39 These results were consistent across different clustering methodologies, with a study applying novel graph theory techniques to hospital admissions finding a distinct cluster of cardiovascular-related conditions, including cardiac arrythmias and CHD.34 Three conditions, namely hypertension, CHD, and acute cerebrovascular disease, formed a comprehensive multimorbid web with T2DM.28 These conditions were the most common comorbidities of T2DM, and conversely, the other way around whereby T2DM was also the most common comorbidity of each of these conditions.28,30 This web demonstrates a bidirectional, mutually reinforcing association between these conditions and T2DM.

Several studies exhibited distinct clusters containing mainly mental health conditions.24,31,33,34 In an English cohort, a cluster composed of depression, severe mental illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma was observed regardless of duration lived with T2DM,24 and with more prominent representation among women.24,33 Specifically, Seng and colleagues33 found that younger women formed a distinct cluster with high psychiatric disease burden, including anxiety, major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, whereas an Australian study found a similar cluster predominantly containing conditions such as depression, psychoses, and substance abuse, along with liver disease.34

How Does Multimorbidity Vary According to Duration of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?

There was a clear lack of longitudinal cohort-based multimorbidity studies that tracked specific patients over time. Rather, the few studies that considered some element of time stratified patients by the duration lived of T2DM at the time of study. A cluster of older patients with moderate to long T2DM duration were found to have high disease burden with end-organ complications, for example, myocardial infarction, end-stage renal disease, stroke, and amputation.33 This finding was consistent with findings by Gao and colleagues,29 as longer T2DM duration and older age were associated with a higher prevalence of all comorbidities. Cluster analysis at 2, 5, and 9 years post-T2DM diagnosis revealed a diversification of conditions as T2DM progresses.24 This finding was demonstrated by an increase in the number and heterogeneity of clusters formed, departing from the previously distinct body systems found in clusters of earlier duration, for example, closer clustering of depression and asthma at 9 years after diagnosis compared with at diagnosis.24 Hypertension consistently appeared in the top combination duos of conditions at both 2 and 5 years after diagnosis of T2DM alongside CKD (15.4%, 17.8%), CHD (10.3%, 11.3%), atrial fibrillation (7.5%, 8.7%), stroke (6.9%, 8.0%), and across age stratifications (Fig. 4).24 Interestingly, out of all the chronic comorbidities, hypertension had the highest incidence density in the year before T2DM diagnosis (75.2 new cases per 1000 patient-years), but decreased significantly at 5 years after diagnosis (42.6 new cases per 1000 patient-years).30Fig. 4 Prevalence of top comorbidity combinations at diagnosis for patients with T2DM.

What Is the Impact on Health Care Utilization?

Patients with diabetes have high rates of hospitalization, more complex hospital trajectories, with more transitions between other conditions, and double the number of “admission sequences” compared with patients without diabetes.34 Moreover, rates of health care utilization are disproportionately higher in T2DM patients with mental health comorbidities than those without.33,40 Seng and colleagues33 found that the use of tertiary health care was highest among (a) “younger females with short to moderate T2DM duration and high psychiatric disease burden” and (b) “older patients with moderate to long T2DM duration and high disease burden with end-organ complications.”33 Compared with healthy patients, the risk of emergency department visits was 3.31 times higher for group (a) and 2.47 times higher for group (b).

Having a mental comorbidity was significantly and independently associated with a 1.25 times increased risk of being admitted to hospital, 1.30 times as likely to use emergency and specialist care, and 1.17 times as likely to visit the general practitioner compared with only having physical concordant comorbidities.40 This finding highlights the amplified effect of mental comorbidities on health care utilization for multimorbid patients with T2DM.

Overall, the reviewed studies demonstrated that:• The multimorbidity clusters were dominated by conditions directly related to T2DM pathogenesis, for example, hypertension, disorders of lipid metabolism, and obesity, often considered risk factors for other comorbidities.24,28,31,32,37,38

• Across several studies, concordant vascular-related conditions frequently appeared in clusters24,28,29,31 and combination groupings,30,37,38 such as CHD, PVD, stroke, and CKD.

• Four studies demonstrated distinct clusters of mental health comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety,31,34 with particularly elevated prevalence among younger women.24,33

• As the duration of T2DM increases, clusters demonstrate increased heterogeneity departing from clusters previously belonging to distinct body systems, which indicates diversification of multimorbidity at progressive intervals.24

• Health care utilization rates are high among multimorbid patients with T2DM,34 especially among those with mental health comorbidities.33,40

Discussion

In this first-ever review of the findings of epidemiologic studies focusing on T2DM-related multimorbidity clustering, the authors found common comorbidities of T2DM to be hypertension, cardiovascular-related diseases, microvascular conditions, depression, and lipid disorders. Their findings indicate that generally T2DM individuals who are older, female, and more deprived are at a higher risk of having T2DM-related multimorbidity.

Concordant comorbidities, such as hypertension and cardiovascular and microvascular conditions, dominated clusters across the studies, agreeing with global trends in T2DM complications27 and novel nonclustering studies.41 Hypertension was the most central condition, indicating it was an important mediator of connections between other conditions, seen across various subgroups.41 This finding is consistent with the long-standing literature that hypertension is the key driver in the development of cardiovascular and microvascular conditions. Given the highly prevalent co-occurrence of hypertension and other precursor conditions, such as obesity and lipid disorders, and their established roles as drivers of vascular morbidity and mortality, it is important to focus on these as key risk factors in the control and management of T2DM and related multimorbidity. In the case of PVD, prolonged time spent with hypertension can worsen downstream microvascular conditions, such as retinopathy and foot ulcers, which are often irreversible and should be the focus of secondary prevention programs.28

Although concordant comorbidities, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, are central to T2DM-related multimorbidity, discordant comorbidities, such as depression and osteoarthritis, can have a direct adverse effect on self-care behaviors.26 Specifically, mental health disorders may have effects on T2DM self-management, quality of life, and subsequent control of overlapping risk factors, such as diet and physical activity.42 As these findings indicate, depression is frequently associated with T2DM-related multimorbidity consistent with epidemiologic research that demonstrates the increasing prevalence of comorbid depression in T2DM populations globally.27,43,44 The association of T2DM with depression is likely to be bidirectional and involving common hormonal and inflammatory pathways.45 The concurrence of both physical conditions and mental health disorders has been associated with significantly worse health outcomes, compared with those without comorbid mental illness42; this indicates a need to adopt a more holistic approach to managing T2DM-related multimorbidity, such that deterioration in mental health can be detected early to prevent further morbidity burden.

Challenges Within the Field of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus–Related Multimorbidity

The identification of multimorbidity clusters serves several purposes. First, it allows for the descriptive characterization of multimorbidity in populations in a way that takes into account a comprehensive spectrum of conditions; second, it identifies subsets of the population that may be driving demands on health systems; and third, it provides clues to the diverse etiologic pathways of T2DM-related morbidity. However, this review exposes several challenges and gaps in this rapidly evolving literature on T2DM-related multimorbidity.

First, the current literature does not provide clear distinction of the temporality or sequence of phenotypes of multimorbidity and clustering. Specific temporal trends in T2DM-related multimorbidity are yet to be studied in more population-based settings,28 as reviewed studies were largely cross-sectional. In addition, concordant conditions are likely to have an inflated coprevalence with T2DM because of care-related factors; for example, clinicians will be more attentive for T2DM in a patient that has myocardial infarction.30 Second, it is difficult to infer the magnitude of association and risk of different forms of multimorbidity. Traditional definitions of multimorbidity rely on counts of conditions18 and do not normally consider important factors, such as the burden of the disease, severity, and the interaction between conditions, as this is reflected in most of the reviewed studies that predominantly report on counts or prevalence. Third, the heterogeneity of methodologic approaches, data inputs, and condition classifications makes comparisons across studies difficult. Cluster analysis itself is an exploratory classification method, and different algorithms can yield different results.31 These limitations have made for difficult interpretation, and translation of findings into meaningful clinical applications.

Future Direction: Longitudinal Clustering

To make this literature more useful and interpretable for clinical and public health practice, adoption of specific reporting guidelines across cluster analyses46; the application of such techniques to a variety of low-income settings; and the advancement of clustering research toward more longitudinal progression-focused exploratory approaches utilizing the advances of machine learning should be considered.35 A shift from a prevalence-based to an incidence-based epidemiologic approach guided by etiologic medical literature will reveal the trajectories of multimorbidity rather than patterns conflated by risk factors accrued earlier in the patient journey. Such approaches are crucial to reveal temporal associations, to estimate population preventable fractions, and to identify leverage points whereby an intervention can have a greater magnitude of effect in multimorbid patients compared to a more downstream intervention.

Clinical Applications: Stratification and Holistic Care

As further work identifies risk patterns for multimorbidity among subpopulation groups, T2DM populations could be stratified according to the risk of developing multimorbidity, dominant clusters of conditions in order to implement specific preventative measures. For instance, the authors’ findings show it is important to prioritize dementia screening for patients with longer T2DM duration, and depression, specifically for younger women.24,33 Alongside mental health conditions, identifying and managing other prominent comorbidities have the potential to reduce polypharmacy burden through control of common risk factors and to optimize treatment pathways via reductions in fragmented care.10,40 Targeting central conditions (eg, hypertension and obesity), themselves risk factors for a host of other conditions, can realign care provisions beyond a traditional single disease focus.

Summary

T2DM-related multimorbidity is complex and exhibits variation in different study populations. Common comorbidities in patients with T2DM are hypertension, lipid disorders, cardiovascular-related conditions (eg, CHD), microvascular conditions, and depression. Patients with T2DM that are older, female, and more deprived are generally at higher risk of developing multimorbidity. Clinicians should be increasingly aware of the more heterogeneous needs of individuals living with T2DM, particularly surrounding mental health. Future research is needed to explore more granular patient trajectories, their associated risk factors, and population-level temporal trends to further both clinical delivery and public health planning purposes.

Clinics care points

• Patient stratification is key to tackling multimorbidity at the clinical level: a preventative approach to detecting and monitoring specific comorbidities with high likelihood in particular demographic segments, for example, development of risk scores to guide timely intervention for delaying end-stage organ complications like renal failure or myocardial infarction in middle-aged patients with chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular disease, respectively.

• Research to assess suitability of a depression and/or dementia screening program for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: increased provision of screening for depression among younger adults, particularly women, and dementia for patients with longer type 2 diabetes mellitus duration is perhaps a crucial component in curbing the severity of type 2 diabetes mellitus–related multimorbidity.

• Holistic and dynamic clinical treatment and management: important to focus management of concordant type 2 diabetes mellitus comorbidities through common risk factors (eg, hypertension and hyperlipidemia) and account for patients’ behavioral risk factors (eg, exercise, diet, smoking) and living contexts (eg, the effect of deprivation) for more holistic care.
