This article describes the discovery of novel potent muscarinic receptor antagonists identified during a search for more active histamine H3 receptor (H3R) ligands. The idea was to replace the flexible seven methylene linker with a semirigid 1,4-cyclohexylene or p-phenylene substituted group of the previously described histamine H3R antagonists ADS1017 and ADS1020. These simple structural modifications of the histamine H3R antagonist led to the emergence of additional pharmacological effects, some of which unexpectedly showed strong antagonist potency at muscarinic receptors. This paper reports the routes of synthesis and pharmacological characterization of guanidine derivatives, a novel chemotype of muscarinic receptor antagonists binding to the human muscarinic M2 and M4 receptors (hM2R and hM4R, respectively) in nanomolar concentration ranges. The affinities of the newly synthesized ADS10227 (1-{4-{4-{[4-(phenoxymethyl)cyclohexyl]methyl}piperazin-1-yl}but-1-yl}-1-(benzyl)guanidine) at hM2R and hM4R were 2.8 nM and 5.1 nM, respectively.

Introduction

In addition to mediating the inhibition of synthesis and release of histamine from histaminergic neurons via a negative feedback loop, the histamine H3 receptor (H3R) also exerts modulatory effects on numerous other neurotransmitter systems, including the cholinergic system, in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Stimulation of H3 heteroreceptors in the central nervous system (CNS) by H3R agonists (imetit, immepip) diminishes acetylcholine (ACh) release; however, blocking H3 autoreceptors activity with the H3R antagonist (thioperamide) increases ACh release.1 Additionally, the ability of H3R antagonists to improve cognition and to increase release of ACh in rats was described.2 Activation of H3R in CNS reduces ACh release in the rat cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and basolateral amygdala.1,3−6 In addition, the histaminergic neurons in the ventral striatum modulate the activity of neighboring cholinergic neurons. Histamine released from histaminergic nerve terminals inhibits dopamine release, which decreases γ-aminobutyric acid release, and, in turn, increases the release of acetylcholine. Disturbances in the CNS cholinergic system have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, or epilepsy.7−10 H3R treatment has also been found to modulate cholinergic transmission in the peripheral nervous system.11 H3R activation reduces the release of [3H]-ACh induced by electrical stimulation in the longitudinal smooth muscle/myenteric plexus preparations.12,13

Muscarinic M2 and M4 receptor (M2R and M4R, respectively) antagonists represent compounds of interest for potential drugs. Activation of M2R and M4R inhibits adenylyl cyclase via the stimulation of the Gi/o G-protein, whereas M1R, M3R, and M5R mediate the stimulation of phospholipase C via Gq/11 G-protein.14 The cognitive deficits observed in aging and Alzheimer’s disease have been associated with brain cholinergic deficits. However, cognitive performance could be enhanced by selective blockade of presynaptically located M2 autoreceptors, which could increase ACh release into the synaptic cleft.15 One of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors approved for use across the full spectrum of these cognitive disorders is donepezil; however, numerous potent M2R antagonists including SCH-217443 (Chart 1) have shown efficacy in increasing ACh release and improving cognitive functions.16 The effective dose of SCH-217443 in the rodent cognition model was found to be 30-fold lower than that known to increase heart rate in rats.16 It is considered that ACh plays a crucial role in governing learning and memory processes.17 Therefore, AChE inhibitors constitute a major drug class in the treatment of dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease, but provide only modest symptomatic benefit. Another approach to the therapy of Alzheimer’s disease is to inhibit the presynaptic activity of the muscarinic M2R expressed on the cholinergic neurons, in regions involved in learning and memory processes.18,19 As previously mentioned, the histamine H3R exerts modulatory effects on the cholinergic system, and H3R antagonist increases ACh release. Therefore, dual active H3R/M2R antagonists were invented and described.2 Those dual active ligands (Chart 1) relates to the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit disorder, and autism.

Chart 1 Structures of Histamine H3R (ADS1017, ADS1020), Muscarinic M2R (SCH-217443), Muscarinic M4R (PCS 1055), Muscarinic M2R/M4R (AF-DX 384), and H3R/M2R (8) Antagonists

The muscarinic M4R are expressed in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens; these areas are all related to social behaviors and cognitive functions.20−22 M4R agonists and allosteric modulators may be useful for the therapy of Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, or treatment of drug abuse. Many M4R antagonists display limited selectivity between receptor subtypes. One recently described selective and potent M4R competitive antagonist is PCS1055 (Chart 1).23 M4R antagonists may produce psychotic-like symptoms (ADHD, hallucinations); nevertheless, they may be useful pharmacological tools in elucidating the M4R signaling mechanism. Experimental data suggest that M4R autoreceptors located in cholinergic interneurons may be useful in increasing ACh release in the striatum. This approach may be a promising alternative therapeutic method in Parkinson’s disease therapy.24

In contrast to the variety apparent in ligands, the binding sites of the H3R and muscarinic receptors share many common features. Studies suggest that H3R had a common ancestor with the muscarinic receptors.25 A detailed comparison of the active site sequences is summarized in the Supporting Information (Table S1).

An analysis of the complexes formed between the hM2R and hM4R and their antagonists identifies 25 amino acids of key importance for ligand binding. As shown in Figure 1, 10 of these (40%) are identical to those of the hH3R.26 Most of the remaining amino acids retain the physicochemical properties of their histamine receptor analogs. It should be emphasized that the number and distribution of aromatic amino acids significantly modify the ligand available space at the binding site. In the case of the studied receptors, the conformation of aromatic amino acids 2.61, 2.64, 3.33, 6.51, 6.48, and 7.39 seems to be of particular importance. Earlier studies also indicate that phenylalanines F192, F193 located at the end of H3R ECL2 and their analogs from M2R (F180, F181) and M4R (F189, L190) are involved in the binding of ligands.27 Another significant similarity between the analyzed receptors is the presence of an extensive amino acid at position 7.42 (H3R L7.42, M2R and M4R C7.42), which can modify the arrangement of W6.48 in the inactive state of the receptor.28

Figure 1 The amino acid sequence of the H3R, specifying the amino acids involved in the binding of the ligands. Amino acids identical to the M2R and M4R are marked in green and differing in yellow.26

The differences between the two pairs of amino acids seem particularly important due to their participation in the binding of endogenous ligands. The first is the glutamic acid present in the H3R, E5.46, which is replaced by alanine in all muscarinic receptors. Mutagenesis studies carried out on the histamine H3R within this site indicate that such a replacement significantly weakens or completely prevents the effective binding of both agonists and antagonists. The second pair is the T6.52 from the H3R which replaces the N6.52 present in all muscarinic receptor subtypes. This limits the number of potential hydrogen bonds formed at this site while reducing the polarity of the surroundings. It is worth noting that mutagenesis studies indicate that the presence of asparagine at this position is essential for ligand binding at the muscarinic receptors binding site.29,30 Such differences merit particular consideration when designing new ligands for both histamine H3R and M2R and M4R; slight structural changes may significantly determine the activity profile of the new compounds.

Results and Discussion

This article describes the discovery of novel potent muscarinic receptor antagonists identified during a search for more active H3R ligands. Our previous study clarified whether both nitrogen atoms of the piperazine ring are necessary to maintain a high activity in the H3R antagonists, ADS1017 and ADS1020 (Chart 1), and determined the influence of moving the benzyl- and 4-trifluoromethylbenzyl substituents from the N1 to the N3 position of the guanidine.31 Finally, two symmetrical compounds, 1,4-bis{4-[1-(4-trifluoromethylbenzyl)guandin-1-yl]but-1-yl}piperazine (ADS1030) and 1,4-bis(7-phenoxyheptyl)piperazine (ADS1031), were synthesized to identify the part of the parent compound that plays a key role in blocking H3R. The most potent derivatives we found had piperazine as a central core with disubstitution to N1 of guanidine. Compounds based on 1-[4-(piperazin-1-yl)but-1-yl]guanidine proved to be key to maintaining a high affinity at the histamine H3R. Based on previously obtained data of the guanidine series, two representative of the lead compounds, that is, ADS1017 and ADS1020, were selected for further structural optimization.31,32 In this paper, we have focused on the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a guanidine series where a flexible alkyl chain consisting of seven methylene groups, present in the lead compounds, is replaced by 1,4-cyclohexylene or p-phenylene group connected directly or by a methylene group to piperazine and phenoxy moieties. Additionally, for derivatives bearing a 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexylene group, the (E) and (Z) isomers were separated and pharmacologically tested independently (Chart 2).

Chart 2 Target Molecules of This Study

The idea of synthesizing compounds in which the flexible alkyl chain was replaced by a semirigid aryl or cycloalkyl ring arose from our previous experiments and literature data.33 Previous studies have demonstrated that replacement of the alkyl chain with more rigid moieties such as aryl or heterocyclic rings results in the formation of highly affine H3R ligands.34 Furthermore, a moiety with a more restricted conformation may be better fitted to the receptor-binding site due to reduced flexibility (i.e., degrees of freedom).28 A key design element was to conserve the number of atoms between the phenoxy moiety and the basic nitrogen of piperazine and maintain an overall reduction in the number of rotatable bonds, thus producing more conformationally restricted compounds.

All newly synthesized compounds were evaluated as antagonists at H3R on guinea pig ileum (gpH3R), following which their selectivity to histamine H1R (gpH1R) and muscarinic M2R/M3R (gpM2R/M3R) was investigated. During these bioactivity profiling studies, the tested compounds demonstrated high affinities at muscarinic receptor subtypes. Therefore, all compounds were subjected to radioligand displacement assay in membrane fractions of HEK-293 cells stably expressing human H3R (hH3R). Finally, hM1–hM5 radioligand binding experiments were carried out for selected ligands. For two compounds, the intracellular Ca2+ level was measured as a functional response to ACh. Further investigation of the potent H3R antagonist ADS1017 also revealed additional moderate affinity to hM2R and hM4R, which may justify searching for other dual-active ligands in the guanidine group. The present paper describes the discovery of the novel potent muscarinic receptor antagonist ADS10227 (Chart 1), which demonstrates particular activity against the hM2R and hM4R. To understand the molecular basis of the unexpected muscarinic activity, in silico studies were also conducted.

Chemistry

Synthesis of (E)-1,4-Bis(bromomethyl)cyclohexane (3a) and (Z)-1,4-Bis(bromomethyl)cyclohexane (3b)

To synthesize 3a and 3b, we started with a commercially available mixture of (Z)- and (E)-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. The NMR spectrum indicated that the ratio of (Z) and (E) isomers was 35:65%. The E/Z 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol mixture was reacted with benzoyl chloride to give a mixture of (E)-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol dibenzoate (1a) and (Z)-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol dibenzoate (1b). The isomers were separated by multiple recrystallizations from ethyl acetate. Pure (>99% purity) isomer (E) was isolated as transparent plaques by two recrystallizations. Isolation of isomer (Z) was more complicated. The filtrate obtained after the first recrystallization was evaporated and recrystallized again. The crystals were discarded, and the filtrate containing 87% of (Z)-isomer was evaporated and recrystallized. The resulting crystals contained high-purity isomer (Z) (>99% purity). 1,4-Cyclohexanedimethanol 2a (E-isomer) and 2b (Z-isomer) were obtained from 1a and 1b, respectively, by de-esterification with sodium hydroxide. 1,4-Bis(bromomethyl)cyclohexane 3a and 3b were obtained by bromination of 2a and 2b with phosphorus tribromide.

Synthesis of Guanidines ADS10207, ADS10239, ADS10183, ADS10210, ADS10283, ADS10227, and ADS10185

Further synthetic procedures were similar for all newly synthesized compounds and analogous to the previously described routes of synthesis.32 Etherification of 3a and 3b and commercially available 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene with sodium phenoxide in anhydrous ethanol led to 4a, 4b, and 11. The 1-(substituted)piperazines 5a, 5b, 12, and 18 were obtained from 4a, 4b, and 11, commercially available 1-(bromomethyl)-4-phenoxybenzeneby alkylation with piperazine. N-alkylation of 5a, 5b, 12, and 18 with 4-bromobutyronitrile in the presence of potassium carbonate in acetonitrile led to formation of 4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]butanenitrile 6a, 6b, 13, and 19. The 4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]butan-1-amines 7a, 7b, 14, and 20 were reduced with LiAlH4 in dry diethyl ether. N-acylation with benzoyl chloride or 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine led to the synthesis of N-{4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}benzamides 8a, 8c, and 15a or N-{4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzamides 8b, 8d, 15b, and 21; subsequently reduced with LiAlH4 in dry diethyl ether to 4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]-N-(benzyl)butan-1-amines 9a, 9c, and 16a or 4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]-N-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]butan-1-amines 9b, 9d, 16b, and 22. Guanylation with 1,3-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-2-methylisothiourea in the presence of triethylamine and 10% excess of mercury(II) chloride resulted in 2,3-di(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1-{4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]but-1-yl}-1-(benzyl)guanidines 10a, 10c, and 17a or 2,3-di(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1-{4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]but-1-yl}-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]guanidines 10b, 10d, 17b, and 23.

The final compounds were obtained by acidic deprotection of Boc groups from the guanidine moiety, resulting in 1-{4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]but-1-yl}-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]guanidines ADS10207, ADS10239, ADS10183, and ADS10210 or 1-{4-[4-(substituted)piperazin-1-yl]but-1-yl}-1-(benzyl)guanidines ADS10283, ADS10227, and ADS10185. An overview of the procedures is presented in the Methods section. For more details, see the Chemical synthesis and data analysis section in the Supporting Information. The structures and purity of the synthesized final products were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectra and elemental analysis (see Supporting Information). The synthesis of the ADS10183, ADS10185, ADS10207, ADS10210, ADS10227, ADS10239, and ADS10283 compounds is depicted in Schemes 1, 2, and 3. ADS1017 was synthesized according to Staszewski et al.32

Ex Vivo Screening of Histamine H3R Antagonist on Guinea Pig Ileum

The H3R antagonist potency of the newly synthesized compounds was measured on the isolated guinea pig ileum electrically stimulated to the contractions according to Vollinga et al.35 During the ex vivo assay, some additional effects were noticed. Concentrations of tested compounds of 0.3 μM and lower shifts the concentration–response curve very slightly to the right compared to the reference (R)(−)-α-methylhistamine (RAMH) curve, while the higher concentrations necessary to determine the pA2 value significantly decreased electrically evoked tissue contractions. This effect prevented the applied functional assay from determining the pA2 value for the H3R. Nevertheless, the tested compounds were found to modify the contractility of the guinea pig ileum. This effect could be related to H3R agonism as well as on the action on the muscarinic receptors present in the tested tissue. It is worth noting that M2R and M3R antagonists may decrease the electrically evoked contractility of ileum smooth muscles. In contrast to cell line methods, the functional ex vivo tests on the guinea pig ileum allows the effect on a single receptor to be tested, by blocking other receptors as well as interactions with other receptors due to the physiological complexity of animal tissues. In the next stage of the study, we evaluated the impact on the histamine and muscarinic receptors.

Decrease of Contractility in Electrically Stimulated Guinea Pig Ileum

A standard ex vivo assay based on the relaxant response of histamine H3R agonists to electrically driven guinea pig ileum was used to test the influence of ADS compounds on the reduction of electrically evoked tissue contraction. This study, standardly used for screening H3R agonists, was recruited to confirm or exclude ADS compounds as potential H3R agonists. Testing agonists common measurement to quantify the potency is −log EC50, defined as a molar concentration of an agonist required to produce 50% of the maximal response to the agonist.36 The −log EC50 value for RAMH and ADS compounds were evaluated. The results ranged from 5.51 (ADS10185) to 6.88 (ADS10227) and 7.70 for RAMH (Table 1). (Z)-Isomers (ADS10227, ADS10239) were the most effectively reduced contractility. Compounds with disubstituted p-phenylene group and (E)-isomers containing a 1,4-cyclohexylene group demonstrated a lower influence on contractility reduction. Another unique value that describes an agonist is intrinsic activity (the maximal response to an agonist expressed as a fraction of the maximal response for the entire system), where α = 1 indicates that the agonist produces the maximal response.36 Based on the concentration–response curves, a significant difference was observed between the intrinsic activity of RAMH and ADS compounds (Supporting Information): The values were 0.82 for RAMH, 0.97 for ADS10227 (Supporting Information; Figure S44), and 0.98 for ADS10239 (Supporting Information; Figure S45). To confirm or exclude ADS compounds as H3R agonists, the compound with the highest −log EC50 was selected for further studies. Therefore, ADS10227 was used as a potential H3R agonist and thioperamide as the H3R antagonist. The study excluded ADS10227 as an H3R agonist, as no shifts of the concentration–response curve of ADS10227 were observed, compared to those with or without thioperamide. The observed reduction of electrically evoked tissue contraction cannot be associated with H3R agonism, and the values obtained for ADS compounds are not intrinsic activity of H3R agonist. However, observed effects must be related to a different contractility reduction mechanism. At this stage, we associated observed effects with muscarinic receptors, which are able to decrease electrically evoked ileum to the contraction. Following this, we decided to evaluate the ADS series as potential M2R/M3R ligands on the isolated guinea pig ileum.

Ex Vivo Screening of Histamine H1R Antagonist on Guinea Pig Ileum

The second histamine receptor located in the guinea pig ileum is H1R. Because previously described data for compound ADS1017 showed weak, competitive H1R antagonist potency, all newly synthesized compounds were also evaluated for H1R. The H1R antagonistic effect was measured on isolated guinea pig ileum stimulated to contract by histamine.37 To assess and exclude the influence of the ADS compounds on muscarinic receptors, two test variations were used: one with the addition of 0.05 μM atropine and one without. The atropine method indicated an effect on the H1R, while the atropine-free method demonstrated effects on H1R and M2R/M3R. The highest pA2 ratio between the two methods was observed for ADS10227, which further confirmed our presumption about the effect on muscarinic receptors.

Ex Vivo Screening of Muscarinic M2R/M3R Antagonist on Guinea Pig Ileum

Another group of guinea pig intestinal receptors able to regulate smooth muscle contraction is that of the muscarinic receptors, including M2R and M3R. All compounds were tested on the muscarinic receptors using the same animal model. This approach is similar to measuring histamine H1R antagonist activity. Methacholine was used as a receptor agonist, while 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide (4-DAMP) was used as a reference M3R antagonist. As methacholine is not selective according to M2R and M3R, it is not possible to precisely specify which one was responsible for the effect observed on the tissue preparations. Some authors often attribute the results to the minor M3R subtype (gpM2R:M3R = 4:1 or 5:1), which is generally associated with the contractions,38 but such an overinterpretation may be misleading, as indicated by our further hM1R-hM5R radioligand binding assay results shown in Table 2. The tested series demonstrates low to moderate affinities at the muscarinic receptors (pA2 = 5.61–6.97) (Table 1). The two (Z)-isomers, ADS10227 and ADS10239, were the most potent muscarinic receptor antagonists in the series. Compounds with the highest pA2 value against the muscarinic receptor demonstrated the greatest reduction of electrically evoked contraction as well (Table 1). As it was mentioned above, the highest pA2 ratio between the two screening methods of histamine H1R antagonist was observed for ADS10227, which was also the most potent muscarinic M2R/M3R antagonist. These findings partially explain the influence of ADS10227 on the contractility of guinea pig ileum following electrical stimulation. The potent H3R antagonist ADS1017 also demonstrated moderate affinity (pA2 = 6.36) to muscarinic receptors. This observation explains the effect of tested compounds on the isolated guinea pig ileum, but it does not identify the muscarinic receptor subtype the ADS compounds act on. In subsequent studies, we tried to clarify this.

As it was not possible to determine the pA2 value by measuring the potency of H3R on electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum ex vivo, another research method was needed to evaluate the affinity of the ADS compounds for the histamine H3R. Hence, the displacement binding assay was performed in membrane fractions of HEK-293 cells stably expressing hH3R to determine the hH3R binding affinities of the final compounds. [3H]-Nα-Methylhistamine was used as a radiolabeled ligand. Compounds with a 1,4-cyclohexylene or p-phenylene group incorporated into a 7-phenoxyheptyl residue showed at least a 10-fold decrease of affinity relative to ADS1017: The pKi of ADS1017 was 6.80, while that of ADS10227 was 5.23, this being the lowest in the series (Table 2). Measuring the displacement curve obtained for [3H]-Nα-methylhistamine from the human histamine H3R in HEK-293 cell membranes, we confirmed a decrease in affinity to the hH3R.

hM1R–hM5R Radioligand Binding Assays

Unexpectedly, the tests carried out on the guinea pig ileum showed that the rigidity of the seven-carbon alkyl chain by 1,4-cyclohexylene or p-phenylene group not only decreases affinity at the histamine H3R but also significantly increases activity at muscarinic receptors. However, the previously employed method does not strictly elucidate on which one of the muscarinic receptor subtypes the tested compounds act on. To clearly explain the obtained outcome, we engaged the radioligand binding experiment. The hM1–hM5 radioligand binding experiments were performed in the membrane fractions of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) stably expressing human variants of muscarinic receptors. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine was used as the radiolabeled ligand.39 Three compounds were selected from ex vivo screening on guinea pig ileum. The potent histamine H3R antagonist, ADS1017, showed nanomolar affinities to the hM2R (37 nM; −log Ki = 7.43) and hM4R (68 nM; −log Ki = 7.17). This compound is also not completely selective for the remaining muscarinic receptor subtypes with −log Ki values over 6. ADS10227 demonstrated the highest affinity to hM2R and hM4R: 2.8 nM and 5.1 nM, respectively. It is also a potent muscarinic M1R antagonist, and the M1R/M2R selectivity ratio is <10. It is worth noting that such nonspecific anticholinergics are often associated with neuropsychiatric and cognitive disturbances and that nonselective muscarinic M1R/M2R antagonists, such as scopolamine, can produce cognitive deficits. Further structural modifications of ADS10227 should be used to increase selectivity toward the M2R, as these may present fewer potential side effects associated with the activation of the phospholipase C signaling pathway. The third tested compound ADS10239 showed affinity to hM1R, hM2R, and hM4R: 45 nM, 52 nM, and 15 nM, respectively.

Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement

The intracellular calcium level was determined fluorometrically to indicate the potency of ADS10227 to antagonize the functional response of muscarinic M2R (pKB = 8.17) and M3R (pKB = 7.43) expressed on CHO cells to ACh. Linear Schild plot indicates the competitive interaction (slope = 1) of the tested compound (Supporting Information, Figure S55).

In Silico Studies on Receptor Bindings and Selectivity

We conducted in silico molecular modeling studies to understand the molecular basis of the unexpected muscarinic activity of ADS1017 and its newly obtained derivatives. In this way, we wanted to determine the binding mode of the tested ligands to H3R, M2R, and M4R and reveal the structural elements that are key to the interaction with these biological targets. From our point of view, it seems crucial to understand the effects of linker cyclization, which resulted in a strong shift of the activity profile of guanidine derivatives toward muscarinic receptors. Therefore, the next part of the study examined the binding mode of the analyzed compounds to the M2R (PDB: 5ZKB) in an inactive state and to the remodeled M4R and H3R.

As the tested compounds were designed and optimized for the inhibition of the histamine H3R, this was taken as our reference point. The comparison of the binding modes of the ADS1017 (−log Ki (H3R) = 6.80) and ADS10227 (−log Ki (H3R) = 5.23) provided some information that could explain the observed decrease in affinity. The final poses of the ADS1017 and ADS10227 at the histamine H3R binding site are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Binding mode of (A) ADS1017 and (B) ADS10227 to the histamine H3R. The ligands are shown as green sticks and the most important amino acids for interaction with the ligand as yellow sticks.

Docking studies indicated a very consistent binding mode. The locations of key ligand moieties were reproducible for all tested compounds. One of the most important features of this binding mode was the involvement of the entire orthosteric receptor binding site in the interaction with ligands.

The participation of two elements of the orthosteric binding site requires special emphasis. The first is the recognition site for the histamine imidazole fragment.13 It is composed of the amino acids from three transmembrane domains: TM3, TM5, and TM6. In the case of the histamine H3R, E2065.46 plays a very important role. The test compounds interact with this site via the benzyl-bound guanidino moiety. The positively charged guanidine forms an ionic bond with E2065.46 and a cation−π with Y1674.57. In addition, T1193.37 stabilizes the system through hydrogen bonding. The benzyl fragment occupies a hydrophobic pocket built by F193, L1995.39, W3716.48, and M3786.55. The second important element of the binding site is D1143.32 which physiologically interacts with the protonated amine moiety of histamine.13 The tested compounds bind to D1143.32 via the piperazine ring. According to our prediction, the piperazine ring of ADS1017 and ADS10227 was protonated at the nitrogen atom substituted by the 7-phenoxyheptyl or 4-(phenoxymethyl)cyclohexylmethyl substituent, respectively. This described binding mode indicates the participation of the first, protonated amine in the ionic interactions with D1143.32 (salt bridge) and W1103.28 (cation−π). The second, nonionized amino group was an acceptor of the hydrogen bond formed with the hydroxyl group Y3746.51. Based on these observations, we can assume that both piperazine nitrogen atoms are essential, and removal of any of them may lead to weakening of ligand binding. This observation is consistent with the results of previous experiments.31

We found that the activity differences in the studied group of compounds are related to ligand alignment in the hydrophobic regions between TM2, TM3, and TM7. This area includes a number of aromatic amino acids such as Y912.61, Y942.64, W1103.28, F3987.39, and W4027.43. The arrangement in this space determines the interaction of the phenoxy group in the so-called allosteric binding site. The long and flexible aliphatic linkage of ADS1017 allows the phenoxy group to create interactions with the amino acids of the outer part of the so-called allosteric site such as Y18945.51 (π–π) and R3816.58 (cation−π). Similar interactions were not observed in any of the newly synthesized compounds, which may be the reason for their much weaker interaction with H3R.

In the case of muscarinic receptors, changes in the TM3, TM5, and TM6 regions responsible for selectivity for physiological ligands (ACh) alter the position of the guanidine fragment and benzyl group. The final binding poses of the ADS1017 and ADS10227 at the muscarinic M2 receptor binding site are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Binding modes of (A) ADS1017 and (B) ADS10227 to the muscarinic M2R. The ligands are shown as green sticks and the most important amino acids for interaction with the ligand as yellow sticks.

The key amino acids for both the muscarinic M2R and M4R (amino acid numeration M2R/M4R) are N4046.52/N4176.52 and A1945.46/A2035.46. They form a hydrogen-bond network with the guanidine group of the ligand. The associated aromatic ring was placed higher than during the binding of the same compound to the histamine H3R, which strengthens the interactions with F181 and Y4036.51 in the muscarinic M2R. On this basis, we assumed that the switch from F181 in M2R to L190 in M4R may explain the slight difference between the activities at these receptors. The final binding poses of the ADS1017 and ADS10227 at the muscarinic M4R binding site are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Binding modes of (A) ADS1017 and (B) ADS10227 to the muscarinic M4R. The ligands are shown as green sticks and the most important amino acids for interaction with the ligand as yellow sticks.

The piperazine ring located in the middle of the ligand creates similar interactions in the active sites of the M2R and M4R to those observed in the H3R. These regions are nearly identical between those receptors, which explains the affinity of the tested compounds against these biological targets. Again, the area between TM2 and TM7 contributes to ligand binding in this region and influences the position of the phenoxy group at the so-called allosteric binding site. 1,4-Cyclohexylene or p-phenylene group bind more strongly to the muscarinic receptor due to the slight differences in the structure of the outer part of the receptors. One of the key factors responsible for the stronger affinity of ADS1017 to H3R seems to be the involvement of R3816.58 in the creation of cation−π interactions. This interaction is possible thanks to a long flexible aliphatic chain between the piperazine ring and the p-phenylene group. Change to N4106.58/N4236.58 present in M2R and M4R weakens the binding of ADS1017 to these receptors. The binding mode of compounds with the cyclized linker indicates a preference for aromatic interactions with amino acids located on TM2 and TM7 of muscarinic receptors. In the compound ADS10227, Y802.61/Y892.61, Y832.64/Y922.64, W4227.35/W4357.35, and Y4267.39/Y4397.39 participate in the phenoxy group bonding. In this case, the change from H3R Y3947.35 to W4227.35/W4357.35 present in M2R and M4R allows a stronger binding of the aromatic system in ligands with cyclized linkers. A two-dimensional map of interactions between the ADS1017 and ADS10227 ligands and H3, M2, and M4 receptors is presented in Supporting Information.

The in silico research yields two important observations. The first is the benzylguanidine fragment demonstrates a universal match for the recognition sites of specific ligands of the H3R, M2R, and M4R located between TM3, TM5, and TM6. This is an important finding for scientists developing similar compounds because of their potential interaction with unintended biological targets (off-target determination). On-targeted optimization of such fragments can direct the affinity/activity profile of developed compounds. Second, the piperazine ring demonstrates a very stable position and may serve as a good core for new compounds with strong affinity to both the H3R and muscarinic receptors. The key interactions created by ADS1017 and ADS10227 within H3R, M2R, and M4R binding sites are presented in Table 3.

Conclusion

A series of new guanidine derivatives was synthesized to identify new nonimidazole histamine H3R antagonists. The seven-carbon chain present in the lead compounds ADS1017 and ADS1020 (Chart 1) was replaced by a semirigid moiety containing 1,4-cyclohexylene or p-phenylene group. In all cases, the substitution resulted in the significant decrease of H3R antagonistic activity as well as the formation of potent muscarinic M2R and M4R antagonists which showed antagonist affinities in single-digit nanomolar concentration ranges. It is noteworthy that the histamine H3R and muscarinic receptors have very similar binding sites (Table S1). The pharmacological profiling of the newly synthesized compounds led us to the identification of the most promising compound ADS10227, demonstrating the highest affinity to the hM2R (2.8 nM; −log Ki = 8.55) and hM4R (5.1 nM; −log Ki = 8.29) compared to the low affinity at H3R and the other muscarinic receptors. This compound favoring muscarinic M2R and M4R may serve as a new lead structure for further structural modifications to develop a novel class of selective M2R antagonists useful in the treatment of cognition deficit diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, or CNS learning disorders, such as autism or attention deficit disorder. ADS1017 also remains within the scope of interest as a dual-active H3R/M2R antagonist in relation to the treatment of cognition deficit disorders.

All the newly synthesized compounds were guanidine derivatives, which is the new chemotype of muscarinic receptor antagonists. Previous studies have described guanidine-containing compounds that can act as muscarinic receptor antagonists; however, the correct chemical nomenclature should classify them as carboximiamides.41 All muscarinic receptor subtypes share a high sequence homology in the binding site, which hinders the discovery of subtype-selective ligands. A small number of pharmacological agents that are selective to muscarinic receptors subtypes still remains challenging in the development of therapeutics that target muscarinic receptors. Such selective muscarinic ligands are needed to prevent undesired side-effects.

The major achievement of this study is the development of the ADS10227 nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist. The separation of the E/Z-isomers of derivatives bearing a 1,4-cyclohexylene group provides a clearer picture of the spatial conformation of (Z)-isomers to fit the binding site of the M2R and M4R. The novel set of obtained ligands may constitute a promising toolbox to study the requirements of muscarinic receptors and could serve as starting points for further structural modifications, leading to the design of compounds with nanomolar affinity at muscarinic M2R or M4R.

Biological Evaluation

Ex Vivo Assay for Screening Histamine H3R Antagonists on Guinea Pig Ileum

Male guinea pigs, weighing 300–400 g, were euthanized by a blow to the neck. Following this, a 20–30 cm length of the distal ileum, apart from the terminal 5 cm, was rapidly removed and placed in phosphate buffer at room temperature (pH 7.4) containing (mM) NaCl (136.9), KCl (2.6), KH2PO4 (1.47), Na2HPO4 (9.58), and indomethacin (1 × 10–6 mol/L)). The intraluminal content was rinsed, and the isolated intestine was cut into 1.5–2 cm segments. The preparations were mounted between two platinum electrodes isotonically in a 20 mL organ bath filled with Krebs buffer: composition (mM) NaCl (118), KCl (5.6), MgSO4 (1.18), CaCl2 (2.5), NaH2PO4·H2O (1.28), NaHCO3 (25), glucose (5.55), and indomethacin (3 × 10–7 mol/L). The solution was continuously bubbled with a 95% O2:5% CO2 mixture and maintained at 37 °C under a constant load of 1.0 g (Hugo Sachs Hebel–Messvorsatz (Tl-2)/HF-modem; Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Hugstetten, Germany) connected to a pen recorder (Kipp & Zonen BD41, Delft, Holland). During an equilibration period of 60 min, the Krebs buffer was changed every 10 min. The preparations were then continuously stimulated at 15–20 V at a frequency of 0.1 Hz for a duration of 0.5 ms, with rectangular-wave electrical pulses (Grass Stimulator S-88; Grass Instruments Co., Quincy, Massachusetts, USA). After about 30 min, the twitches were recurrent. Five min before RAMH administration, pyrilamine (1 × 10–5 mol/L concentration in organ bath) was added. The first cumulative concentration–response curve was determined for RAMH (10 nM – 10 mM) at increasing concentrations spaced by 3- or 3.3-fold. The second to the fourth curves were measured against increasing antagonist concentrations (incubation time 20 min). The pA2 values were calculated according to Arunlakshana and Schild.37 Statistical analysis was carried out with the Students’ t test. In all tests, a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The pA2 values were compared with the affinity of thioperamide.

After about 30 min, twitches were recurrent. Thirty min before RAMH or tested agonist administration, famotidine (1 × 10–5 mol/L concentration in organ bath) and pyrilamine (1 × 10–5 mol/L concentration in organ bath) was added. Cumulative concentration–response curve was determined to RAMH or tested agonist (10 nM to 10 mM) at increasing concentrations spaced by 3- or 3.3-fold. The agonist potency is expressed as pD2 value (−log EC50) ± sem. The −log EC50 differences were not corrected since three successive curves were superimposable.

Depending on the type of assay, Krebs buffer additionally contained or did not contain 0.05 μM of atropine. The solution was continuously bubbled with a 95% O2:5% CO2 mixture and maintained at 37 °C under a constant load of 0.5 g (Hugo Sachs Hebel–Messvorsatz (Tl-2)/HF-modem; Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Hugstetten, Germany) connected to a pen recorder (Kipp & Zonen BD41, Delft, Holland).

Male guinea pigs, weighing 300–400 g, were euthanized by a blow to the neck. A 20–30 cm length of the distal ileum, apart from the terminal 5 cm, was rapidly removed and placed in phosphate buffer at room temperature (pH 7.4) containing (mM) NaCl (136.9), KCl (2.6), KH2PO4 (1.47), Na2HPO4 (9.58), and indomethacin (1 × 10–6 mol/L)). The intraluminal content was rinsed, and the isolated intestine was cut into 1.5–2 cm segments. The preparations were mounted isotonically in a 20 mL organ bath filled with Tyrode’s buffer: composition (mM) NaCl (137), KCl (2.7), MgCl2·6H2O (1.0), CaCl2 (1.8), NaH2PO4·H2O (0.4), NaHCO3 (11.9), glucose (5.61), and indomethacin (3 × 10–7 mol/L). The solution was continuously bubbled with a 95% O2:5% CO2 mixture and maintained at 37 °C under a constant load of 0.5 g (Hugo Sachs Hebel–Messvorsatz (Tl-2)/HF-modem; Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Hugstetten, Germany) connected to a pen recorder (Kipp & Zonen BD41, Delft, Holland). During an equilibration period of 40 min, Tyrode’s buffer was changed every 10 min. The first cumulative concentration–response curve was determined for methacholine (10 nM to 3 mM) at increasing concentrations spaced by 3- or 3.3-fold. The second to the fourth (or fifth) curves were measured in the presence of an increasing concentration of antagonist (incubation time 20 min).

In all tests, a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The pA2 values were compared with the affinity of 4-DAMP.

Determination of hH3R Affinity

The radioligand displacement binding assay was performed in membrane fractions of HEK-293 cells stably expressing hH3R. Cell cultivation and membrane preparation were performed according to Kottke et al.43 For the radioligand displacement assay, radioactively labeled [3H]Nα-methylhistamine was used at a final concentration of 2 nM (KD = 3.08 nM). The total assay volume was set to 200 μL. The compounds were tested in several appropriate concentrations between 100 μM and 0.1 nM. Pipetting was partly done by Freedom Evo (Tecan). Pitolisant was used to determine nonspecific binding at a concentration of 10 μM. The membrane fraction (20 μg/well), test compounds, and radiolabeled ligand were incubated for 90 min at 25 °C while shaking. The bound radioligand was separated from free radioligand by filtration through GF/B filters pretreated with 0.3% (m/v) polyethylenimine using a cell harvester. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting using a MicroBeta Trilux (PerkinElmer). The data were obtained in duplicates in at least three independent experiments. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from the raw data to calculate specific-binding values. The evaluation was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.1 (San Diego, CA, USA) using nonlinear regression (one-site competition with a logarithmic scale). The Ki values were calculated from the IC50 values using the Cheng–Prusoff equation.44 The statistical calculations were performed on −log Ki. The mean values and 95% confidence intervals were transformed to nanomolar concentrations.

Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation

The culture was derived from CHO cells stably transfected with the genes of human variants of muscarinic receptors. These were purchased from Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO, USA). Cell cultures and crude membranes were prepared as described previously.45 The cells were grown to confluence in 75 cm2 flasks in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 million cells were subcultured to 100 mm Petri dishes. The medium was supplemented with 5 mM butyrate for the last 24 h of cultivation to increase receptor expression. Cells were detached by mild trypsinization on day 5 after subculture. Detached cells were washed twice in 50 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and 3 min centrifugation at 250g. Washed cells were suspended in 20 mL of ice-cold incubation medium (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na-HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, pH = 7.4) supplemented with 10 mM EDTA and homogenized on ice by two 30 s strokes using a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax; Janke & Kunkel GmbH & Co. KG, IKA-Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) with a 30 s pause between strokes. Cell homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000g. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets suspended in the fresh incubation medium, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged again. The resulting membrane pellets were kept at −80 °C until assay within a maximum of 10 weeks.

Determination of hM1R–hM5R Affinities

All radioligand binding experiments were optimized and carried out according to general guidelines.39 Briefly, membranes were incubated in 96-well plates at 30 °C in the incubation medium described above. Incubation volume was 400 μL or 800 μL for competition and saturation experiments with [3H]NMS, respectively. Approximately 30 μg of membrane proteins per sample were used. N-Methylscopolamine binding was measured directly in saturation experiments using six concentrations (30–1000 pM) of [3H]NMS during incubation for 1 h (M2R), 3 h (M1R, M3R, and M4R), or 5 h (M5R). For calculations of the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), concentrations of free [3H]NMS were calculated by subtraction of bound radioactivity from total radioactivity in the sample and fitting eq 1 (Experimental Data analysis section). The binding of the tested ligands was determined in competition experiments with 100 pM [3H]NMS. The IC50 value was computed according to eq 2, and the inhibition constant Ki according to eq 3. Samples were first preincubated for 1 h with [3H]NMS. Then the tested compound was added and incubation continued for an additional 5 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μM unlabeled atropine. Incubations were terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters (Whatman) using a Brandel cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The filters were dried in a microwave oven, and then solid scintillator Meltilex A was melted on filters (105 °C, 70 s) using a hot plate. The filters were cooled and counted in the Wallac Microbeta scintillation counter.

Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement

Intracellular Ca2+ level was taken as a functional response to ACh. Black 96-well plates were seeded with 12,000 CHO cells per well. After two days of cultivation in DMEM at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, cells were washed with Krebs-HEPES buffer (KHB) (composition: (mM) NaCl (138), KCl (4), CaCl2 (1.3), MgCl2 (1), NaH2PO4 (1.2), HEPES (20), glucose (10), pH adjusted to 7.4) KHB was loaded with 5 μM Fura-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. The cells were washed with fresh KHB and preincubated with tested compounds for 1 h. Then plates were placed in a Cytation 3 reader. The first basal level (fluorescence dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm, emission at 510 nm) was measured. Following this, ACh was added to the desired concentration (ranging from 10 pM to 100 μM) by instrument injectors, and fluorescence was measured immediately. Intracellular Ca2+ level was calculated as a ratio of 340 to 380 nm excitation fluorescence. The changes in intracellular Ca2+ level were compared as a fold increase over the basal level of the corresponding well.

Experimental Data Analysis

Saturation of [3H]NMS Binding

The binding of [3H]NMS at various concentrations was measured. After subtraction of nonspecific binding and calculation of free radioligand concentration, eq 1 was fitted to the data:1

where y is specific binding at free concentration x, BMAX is maximum binding capacity, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant of [3H]NMS.

Binding Parameters of Tested Compounds

Tested compounds are competitive antagonists of [3H]NMS binding. [3H]NMS binding was determined in the presence of tested compounds at various concentrations. After subtraction of nonspecific binding and normalization to binding in the absence of the tested compound, eq 2 was fitted to the data:2

where y is a specific radioligand binding at concentration x of the tested compound expressed as a percent of binding in its absence, IC50 is the concentration of tested compound inhibiting 50% of [3H]NMS binding, and nH is the Hill coefficient.3

where Ki is the inhibition constant of the tested compound, KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant, and [D] is the concentration of [3H]NMS.

Concentration Response to Acetylcholine

The intracellular level of calcium at various concentrations of ACh was measured. After subtraction of background values and normalization to the level in the absence of ACh, eq 4 was fitted to the data:4

where y is the normalized response at ACh concentration x, EMAX is the maximal effect, EC50 is the concentration of ACh causing half-maximal effect, and nH is Hill coefficient. From a series of EC50 values of apparent inhibition constant KB was calculated by fitting eq 5 to dose ratio (DR) induced by tested compound at a given concentration:5

where DR is ratio of EC50 in the presence of tested compound at concentration [B] to EC50 in its absence.

In Silico Studies

All tested ligands were prepared with the appropriate spatial configuration in the Maestro program (Schrödinger) and then charged at pH 7.4 ± 0.2 using the LigPrep program (Schrödinger Release 2017–1; Maestro-Schrödinger, LLC, New York).

All docking experiments were performed with the Glide program (Maestro-Schrödinger) with the SP level of calculation accuracy.46 For the docking purposes, grids centered on the AF-DX 384 (Chart 1) ligand position, sized to dock ligands with length ≤25 Å, were prepared.

The in silico research used the M2R (PDB: 5ZKB) and M4R (PDB: 5DSG) complexes available in the Protein Data Base (PDB) and the previously published homology model of the histamine H3R.28,47,48 All proteins used in the study were prepared with the ProteinPrepare (PlayMolecule-Acellera) website.49 The structure of the ligand has a significant influence on the conformation of the amino acids in the binding site of GPCRs. Being aware of the large differences in the size of the studied ligands and compounds present in the crystallized complexes, it was decided to optimize the structure of the M4R and H3R based on the M2R complex with the compound AF-DX 384 (PDB: 5ZKB) which demonstrated conformational changes in the aromatic amino acids Y1043.33 and Y4267.39 and W993.28.47 Shifting these residues opens up the space needed for larger ligands to interact. This pattern was used to remodel the arrangement of the amino acids in the previously published homologous model of the histamine H3R28 and the structure of the M4R (PDB: 5DSG). The key differences in the position of the most important H3 amino acids are given in Figure S56.

The ligands ADS1017 and ADS10227 were docked to the receptors prepared in this way. Complexes showing consistent binding modes were optimized using the Refine Protein–Ligand Complex function with the Monte Carlo minimization method (Maestro-Schrödinger). Such optimized complexes were used for the final analyzes, and all tested ligands were docked to them. The final results were visualized using PyMol 0.99 rc6 software (DeLano Scientific LLC).
