Abstract

Background

Machine‐learning algorithms and big data analytics, popularly known as ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI), are being developed and taken up globally. Patient and public involvement (PPI) in the transition to AI‐assisted health care is essential for design justice based on diverse patient needs.

Objective

To inform the future development of PPI in AI‐assisted health care by exploring public engagement in the conceptualization, design, development, testing, implementation, use and evaluation of AI technologies for mental health.

Methods

Systematic scoping review drawing on design justice principles, and (i) structured searches of Web of Science (all databases) and Ovid (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health and Embase); (ii) handsearching (reference and citation tracking); (iii) grey literature; and (iv) inductive thematic analysis, tested at a workshop with health researchers.

Results

The review identified 144 articles that met inclusion criteria. Three main themes reflect the challenges and opportunities associated with PPI in AI‐assisted mental health care: (a) applications of AI technologies in mental health care; (b) ethics of public engagement in AI‐assisted care; and (c) public engagement in the planning, development, implementation, evaluation and diffusion of AI technologies.

Conclusion

The new data‐rich health landscape creates multiple ethical issues and opportunities for the development of PPI in relation to AI technologies. Further research is needed to understand effective modes of public engagement in the context of AI technologies, to examine pressing ethical and safety issues and to develop new methods of PPI at every stage, from concept design to the final review of technology in practice. Principles of design justice can guide this agenda.

==== Body
1 INTRODUCTION

Machine‐learning algorithms and big data analytics will revolutionize contemporary health care. Popularly described as ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI), these technologies are being used in health‐care systems across the globe, for example to process population data and identify at‐risk groups, or to determine the best treatment options for individual patients, and to develop precision medicine.1, 2

Despite the advantages of efficiency of scale and depth of computational power,3, 4, 5 concerns have been expressed by scientists, practitioners and broader publics about the systematic datafication of people's lives and their lived experiences of health and illness.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 It is unclear whether AI‐assisted health care always leads to better patient outcomes, whether it empowers and enables patients/service users, carers and their families, and whether patients or the public have a meaningful say over AI‐assisted processes of care or design of such systems.11, 12, 13

This paper explores the issues from the perspective of ensuring that patient and public involvement is not overlooked in imaging and transitioning to AI‐assisted health care. There are implications here for the values of equality, diversity and inclusion in a human/digital intelligent world, which there is only limited space to touch upon.

In medicine and health, patient and public involvement (PPI) has become a principle for health‐care providers and a field of practice and research. In different countries, alternative terms include personal and public involvement (P&PI) or patient and public engagement (PPE). Across the globe, there are major institutions that support PPI, including National Health Service (NHS England) patient and public participation frameworks, the UK National Institute for Health Research Centre for Dissemination and Engagement, the US Patient‐Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)14 and the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia. Previous research on PPI in health has drawn attention to issues of equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) and the professional dominance of the PPI agenda.15, 16, 17, 18, 19 However, this body of work has yet to contend with the urgent issues20, 21, 22 of how PPI might be developed in an AI‐assisted health and research system where ‘unexplainable’ decisions are being made by computers and technology designers.22, 23, 24, 25

New forms of interdisciplinary collaboration26 between patients, designers, data scientists, clinicians, researchers, computer scientists, developers and entrepreneurs are emerging, but very slowly and disproportionately to the scale and speed of technological change. They aim to create innovative, user‐validated and socially responsible products and e‐services with the people who stand to benefit from them, not only with specialists, or health professionals whose views are known to differ from patient perspectives.27, 28 Advances have been made in participant co‐design theory and methods,29, 30, 31 such as the Design Council's (UK) Double Diamond methodology, and in participative medical device design.32, 33 New ‘social licences’ for digital technologies,34 new guidance such as the World Health Organization's mHealth Evidence and Assessment (mERA) checklist and a push for ‘explainable AI’ (XAI) highlight the need to improve the quality and consistency of user‐centred and more inclusive technology conception and design processes.35

This paper draws together evidence about public engagement in the context of newly emerging AI technologies for health to inform new strategies for PPI in health care. The concept of design justice provides a useful perspective that promotes engagement16, 36 and aims to explicitly challenge exclusion and inequalities by valuing inclusion and diversity in design.17, 19, 37, 38, 39

2 AIMS AND APPROACH

We chose to focus our exploration on mental health as this is an area of care where the take‐up of big data and machine‐learning software has already gathered significant pace, and often without public debate on what desirable safeguards should be put in place.1 Machine‐learning applications in clinical psychology and psychiatry are appealing as cost‐cutting sources of scientific knowledge and evidence‐based policy in public mental health care.40, 41 This trend is very likely to accelerate as the COVID‐19 pandemic worsens the mental health crisis and digital solutions become available to triage patients, address the ‘backlog’ to care and to expediate treatment or interventions.42, 43 Depending on the direction of development, AI could also have major benefits for smoothing patient pathways, enhancing workflow in health systems, regulating quality and enabling quality improvement of care.

As this is a new and rapidly evolving context for PPI, we did not want to be too narrow in our view of what PPI is or could become. In the UK context, PPI is at present defined in government policy as a requirement for all publicly funded research and health care. We drew upon existing definitions (to develop our search terms) while also exploring a wider notion and the broader landscape of ‘public engagement’ to allow possibilities for new modes and opportunities for PPI to be identified in the literature.

The approach was therefore to look broadly at evidence on patient participation, patient perspectives, approaches to co‐production and user‐led projects, as well as patient engagement in clinical care, care delivery and service design. We included patient engagement with AI technologies in health‐care contexts and in self‐management of mental health conditions and personal well‐being as these are important ways that patients are engaging with AI technologies and mental health care.

The review explored the following questions: What are the main issues and challenges associated with data‐driven AI‐assisted care that public engagement might help to address?

How and in what contexts have patients and the public been involved in the design of AI technologies in mental health?

Our approach was informed by a conceptual framework, illustrated by Figure 1, which draws on design justice perspectives (described below), the sociology of digital health interventions,44, 45 the anthropology of scientific expertise46 and advances in transdisciplinary knowledge mobilization (KM), all of which can inform policy‐oriented research and public engagement through co‐production or co‐design methodologies.47 These areas of practice and expertise share a concern with attending to the uses of knowledge48 and its conditions of possibility: how it is produced, for what purpose, the type of knowledge produced, about what or whom and on whose terms.49 The framework enabled us to draw on these perspectives to inform the methods described below.

FIGURE 1 Exploring patient and public involvement in AI‐assisted mental health care

3 METHODS

We used a systematic scoping review as this would allow us to focus on identifying issues and themes across an emerging topic field and draw together evidence from relevant published literature, including, but not limited to, evidence about potential avenues for PPI.50, 51

We sought information about how machine‐learning and data‐intensive technologies might enable meaningful and effective public engagement, as well as clarification on how patients and broader publics can contribute to the design of such technologies through a formal PPI process.

3.1 Inclusion/Exclusion

We sought evidence from research studies and insights from professional or patient expertise about public engagement in AI‐assisted mental health. Included articles were those that mentioned or reflected on: (a) any type of patient and public groups involved in one capacity or another, for example as users of technologies, research subjects, public reviewers, patient representatives or co‐researchers; (b) contexts of involvement in the design process; (c) approaches to involvement, ranging from reports on user engagement, to user testing, interviews, consultations, participatory design concepts and shared decision‐making practices; (d) evidence of influence or impact of involvement on design decisions, practices or outcomes, such as published case studies of impact or evaluation reports that explain how a PPI element influenced a research study or the design of a health intervention; and (e) patient and public views on data‐driven approaches to mental health care and research. We sought journal articles, conference proceedings and grey literature. We excluded articles published before 2010, articles published in other languages and articles that did not relate to mental health.

3.2 Search strategy

We used Web‐based searches (carried out in December 2020) through Web of Science (all databases) and Ovid (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health and Embase). The electronic searches were supported and enhanced with handsearching to identify relevant references outside of the research literature. We hand‐searched the journal Health Expectations, the INVOLVE database and materials published by mental health charities. Forward searches were used to track citations of key articles as they are referenced in new articles. Backward search involved looking through the reference lists of returned articles to identify highly relevant source references. We retrieved documents through library search engines, which index published materials and conference proceedings. We also made use of the PCORI Engagement in Health Research Literature Explorer.

3.3 Key search terms

Searches used terms associated with ‘public engagement’ used by Brett and colleagues18 in their systematic review of the impact of PPI and terms used by PCORI. We developed composite terms for AI technologies derived from the literature (see Table 1). Database‐specific MeSH terms for mental health (and other terms where available) were used to expand and consolidate the searches. The full searches can be made available upon request.

3.4 Data extraction

The titles/abstracts of 182 identified articles were read, and if deemed to be relevant to the aim of the review, they were retrieved in full for analysis. The screening process is illustrated by an inclusion flow diagram (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2 Flow diagram of inclusion criteria

3.5 Analysis

We explored and identified themes in the data using a series of thematic analysis techniques52 supported by the use of summaries of articles (literature tables) and analytic tools within NVivo. First, we iteratively developed a thematic code framework to draw out53 emerging themes and subthemes, while retaining links to the original sources to aid retrieval.52 Next, seven principles of design justice (drawing on the international Design Justice Network's ten principles) (see Figure 1) for AI technologies for mental health were applied as a lens through which to consider how AI technologies are currently being used, and as a perspective to identify issues for future research to address. We considered these principles against the themes in the literature, particularly in relation to PPI in the development and use of AI technologies.

3.6 Rigour

The review method was developed and revised by all team members, including identification of databases to be searched and key search terms. Strategies for minimizing biases in the search strategy were as follows: (a) two team members independently cross‐checked more than half of the returned papers against included/exclusion criteria; (b) members of the team discussed and reached agreement on the thematic code framework; and (c) inclusion and use of grey literature extended the searches beyond peer‐reviewed articles.

As part of the approach, we reflected on the strengths and limitations of our perspectives as an anthropologist (INITIALS1), research analyst/inclusion advocate (INITIALS2) and social researcher working in an integrated care system (INITIALS3). These techniques included critical reflective conversations about the meaning of PPI, knowledge mobilization and AI technologies in our respective areas of interest and expertise. These conversations allowed us to challenge each other by identifying assumptions in our ways of conceptualizing public engagement, and to use co‐authorship to cross‐check the resonance of our arguments with the evidence.

A preliminary version of this review was presented for critical appraisal at UCL's QHRN (Qualitative Health Research Network) workshop on 11 September 2020. Resulting conversations shaped our understanding about the complexity of data sharing/ownership within health‐care systems and the importance of transparency to service users.

4 RESULTS

All 144 articles included in the scoping review are summarized in literature tables in Appendix 1. Studies mostly originated from the USA, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. It is likely that our searches did not pick up publications relating to forms of ‘public engagement’ in China, and our search terms should be considered in the light of their Western origins. Overall, there was little evidence of work that pursued or engaged in PPI, or patient involvement (5 articles). Nevertheless, the literature does reveal multiple modes for engagement of users, including the following: Design as inclusive practice, for example experts by experience and user representatives within design teams as communities of practice54

Patient‐focused research networks, research collaborations and projects, for example patient‐practitioner‐researcher collaboration55

User‐focused design practices, for example workflow analysis, user feedback,56 user experience design (UX design) or testing, and ‘engagement checks’ within a user‐centred approach to engage specific user groups in co‐design57

Experience‐led design or research methods, for example experience‐based co‐design (EBCD)58; and theory‐driven approaches, for example user‐centric explainable AI (XAI)35

Qualitative research, for example methods to capture patient or user perspectives, including focus groups, patient interviews, ethnography and observation, and semi‐structured interviews59

Quantitative methods, for example patient surveys, rating scales and PROs

Consensus building, for example Delphi methods60

Involvement of communities or social networks in decision making or the provision of care.61

These approaches have mainly been used to access patient and public perspectives and use them in a manageable way to inform design practices, for example statistics, stories, vignettes and case studies. Many studies indicated that direct public involvement in decisions about technological design can drive innovation while offering a moral means of patient empowerment.54, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76

Some studies used data‐intensive technologies as a means for engaging marginalized service users and mobilizing their experiences to develop new structures of public accountability and ways of rebuilding trust.77, 78 Yet, other articles reported on user‐led initiatives or responses to data‐driven applications in contemporary mental health services.79, 80 Other articles described the views of clinicians, patients and wider communities on data sharing, data protection or the use of smartphones,72 smart fabrics and wearables,81, 82 social media and machine‐learning algorithms for managing and monitoring mental distress.83, 84, 85, 86, 87

A few articles described involving patients and other stakeholders as experts by experience, expert consultants and respondents in an effort to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of research14 or data analytics in mental health care.59, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 Others showed commitment to user engagement or user experience (XE) to enhance randomized controlled trials,100 implementation reviews, guidelines for design or reviews of commercially available mental health apps.101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112

Thematic analysis identified three major themes in the literature (summarized by Table 2) that reflect the challenges and opportunities associated with AI‐assisted mental health care: Applications of AI technologies in mental health care

Ethics of public engagement in AI‐assisted mental health care

4.1 Applications of AI technologies in mental health care

4.1.1 Assessment and observation

Our findings show widespread interest in developing data‐driven applications in mental health care as tools for ‘eHealth’ (or e‐health, electronic health) including conducting clinical assessments and monitoring and observing mental distress more widely.26 Online clinical assessment and continuous observation is increasingly possible at a distance from patients,113 using electronic health records114 and an ecology of intersecting data streams collected through ‘mHealth’ (mobile health) devices.115 Such devices include smartphones and wearable/handheld biosensors, social media and other Web‐based activities.65, 93, 116, 117

The notion of ‘iHealth’ (intelligent health) further builds on and expands eHealth by using real‐time self‐monitoring within the patient's environment together with data processing and data mining to support personalized decision making.118 Though the evidence base is still in its infancy, forms of iHealth have been shown to be effective for identifying, monitoring and anticipating mental distress.118, 119 Current limitations to iHealth and eHealth more generally include financial costs, cultural, language and literacy barriers, power supply issues (eg in remote communities), data security and privacy issues.120

Feasibility studies in clinical psychiatry and biomedical engineering have shown that measuring markers of clinical status through data analytics can enable patients and clinicians to pick up early warning signs and accurately track and predict relapses in persons living with severe mental disorders.65, 69, 94, 97, 98 Similarly, recent work in affective computing and computational linguistics suggests that anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal intent can all be observed and measured through data on ordinary ‘naturally’ occurring linguistic forms, such as posts and comments on social media platforms.121, 122, 123, 124, 125 Regardless of the source and type of data, it appears that everything from syntax (eg hashtag analytics of #depression on Instagram),126 semantics and speech acoustics to smartphone typing dynamics, step counts or UV light exposure might, eventually, be used to accurately detect and monitor mental distress.127, 128, 129

AI technologies have the potential to be effective clinical decision support tools (DST).130 Although augmenting, and in some cases exceeding, clinicians' abilities, the diagnostic accuracy of data analysis techniques such as machine‐learning algorithms is never a given and has been known to produce clinically unacceptable rates of error.131, 132 In mental health, reliability is a particularly challenging issue. ‘Ground truths’ (the sample data set machine‐learning systems are trained on) are difficult to establish because historically, mental health disorders have largely been defined by subjective and clinical features.1 The literature describes multiple classes of machine‐learning algorithms, each with their specific properties and varying advantages or limitations depending on the task they are used for and the data they are trained on,87 but public engagement is rare.

4.1.3 Treatment/therapy

Data‐intensive technologies hold clear therapeutic potential. The abundance of digital data has facilitated pharmacoepidemiology and, in particular, observational research on the effectiveness of real‐world medication.133 Websites, social networking and smartphone apps134 are allowing persons experiencing mental distress to self‐manage, access information about their conditions whenever and wherever they choose62, 86, 117 and plan ahead to avoid crisis135 or prevent suicide.136

There are indications that therapies based on co‐designed immersive virtual reality environments137, 138 and virtual humans (eg chatbots) can overcome communication barriers and widen access to better quality care.64, 93, 95 However, it is difficult to distinguish between overzealous claims and actual evidence of therapeutic efficacy. Adverse effects and unintended consequences have been reported.91, 139 Caution has been widely expressed to the pressing need for therapists, clinicians, patients and the public to be systematically involved in design of therapeutic interventions (eg an abundance of mental health apps), which tends to be controlled by private software developers and commercial providers whose products are often disconnected from empirical evidence, professional expertise in mental health care, or the lived experience of patients.92, 104, 108, 109 There is a recognized need to involve culturally diverse communities who speak multiple languages, people with disabilities and communication challenges, support networks of formal carers and family carers,140, 141 all of whom can play an active role in formulating guidelines and standards for evaluating safety and patient outcomes.54, 103, 104, 106

4.1.4 Integration/personalization of care

The use of patient‐generated data in mental health care is limited, but not for much longer. By 2040, AI technologies are expected to play a major role not just in the provision of care but also in integrating health and social care systems, certainly in the UK.71 This makes sense given that recording and combining multiple types of data tends to increase diagnostic accuracy,110 improve personalization of care, treat comorbid mental and physical illnesses, track patient experience across different care services and understand the connections between health and everyday life more broadly.59, 64, 77, 117 Gathering and visualizing data through digital technologies for integration in care services and individual care plans consistently comes up as desirable in co‐design activities.66, 70, 72

Systems of data integration may seem intuitive to patients with comorbidities, as they do not tend to explicitly separate mental and physical health needs,64 or see their experiences of health and illness as a separate part of their lives. A large proportion of research participants recruited in an emergency care setting (over 70 per cent) have agreed to have their social media activity linked with their electronic medical records, though agreement was higher in younger social media users.99 Kumar outlines a framework involving mental health practitioners and various stakeholders at different levels and the channels in which technology can be leveraged while keeping the patients' rights front and centre.142 A perspective that has not yet been given due attention is the integration of AI technologies outside of clinical settings67, 143 or in the everyday spaces where comorbid conditions and habits inter‐relate.68, 144

How data are or could be collected, collated and interpreted marks a common challenge for integrating digital technologies in care services59 and interpreting data.21 However, the toughest challenge for digitally enabled integrated care is in the complexities associated with data ownership, the economic value of personal data, and the monetization of data or ‘knowledge exchange’ practices between various companies and institutions. Public engagement in such decisions could play a critical role in earning public trust at the intersection of competing private and public interests. It could also inform strategies to ensure the interoperability of digital mental health technologies with electronic health records56 and other forms of personal digital data.

4.2 Ethics of public engagement in AI‐assisted mental health care

4.2.1 Inequalities and population biases

Using AI technologies for the early detection of mental health concerns and improving access to evidence‐based interventions have great potential to lead to improved health outcomes,145 particularly for underserved, minority or indigenous populations.146, 147 However, the literature is full of evidence that data‐driven approaches to mental health care can further entrench gendered, ethnic, racial, age‐based, class‐based and geopolitical inequalities.97, 111, 116, 146 The primary concern is that if the ground truth data are limited to social media data or self‐reported medical diagnoses of mental health status, the data will produce biased results: for example, insights will only be generalizable to digitally literate groups or individuals who have sought professional care and felt secure enough to disclose their mental health status.116 Most algorithms reproduce and overlook data biases associated with the sex and gender dimension and its contribution to health and disease differences among individuals.148 Involvement of people with learning disabilities is consistently overlooked as being too complex, meaning there are very few digital interventions developed with these groups.149 In effect, those on the losing side of the digital and socio‐economic divides are further alienated, excluded or disengaged from receiving the care they need.56, 77, 111, 150

4.2.2 Socio‐political context

Public engagement on AI‐assisted mental health care will need to include critical and reflective debates on the broader socio‐political context and its influence in shaping professional practice and treatment of mental disorders.40, 41 There are concerns that maintaining public service provision at the forefront of policymaking and technological development will be an uphill struggle, but this remains an open question.26, 151 Furthermore, there is evidence that ideals of individual responsibility and self‐help can mislead service users into believing that digital technologies yield infallible and objective knowledge of mental distress.152 Misplaced trust in technology could lead to people not seeking professional help when they need it. Valuing principles of diversity and inclusion in technology design is important here because the design of digital tools and interventions must be based on a deep knowledge of the subtleties that distinguish between the social and cultural contexts of use,153, 154, 155 which include the environments and infrastructures where people live.156, 157

Imagining new digitally enabled contexts for care requires practitioners to have awareness of emerging data/legal regulations, data risk assessment and effective strategies for patient engagement, within a necessary medical‐ethical framework for innovation in health‐care technology.158

4.2.3 Safety and acceptability of new practices

Numerous articles point to uncertainty and signal that machine‐learning algorithms, big data and associated digital technologies are placing mental health researchers and care providers in ethically uncharted territory where little is known about safety and acceptability,159 for example issues of how and whether to base care interventions upon predictive analytics,160 what digitally mediated communication might hold for therapeutic relationships between patients and mental health professionals,26 and how to discuss privacy and data protection with patients when the clinically ideal data set is also the most intrusive, and contend with the issue of why the most insightful algorithms are often the ones whose reasoning cannot be accounted for.85, 116, 161

Given the importance of the ethical and moral alignment issues at stake, raising public awareness and understanding of the pros and cons of AI ‐technologies is essential. Failing to involve patients and the public could lead to innovations or applications that are considered unacceptable, are publicly criticized and finally withdrawn. This rejection of AI is exemplified in the public response to the Samaritans Radar, a Twitter app for suicide prevention that failed to engage with the community that it was designed for.79

In the case of mental health apps, leaders in mHealth research, industry and health‐care systems from around the globe are seeking to promote consensus on implementing standards and principles for their evaluation.56 Emerging guidelines indicate two promising strategies for safety and acceptability. One is the rethinking of informed consent in the context of AI technologies as a dynamic, on‐going and relational process, instead of a one‐off event114, 161, 162, 163 The second strategy is a push for redefining the roles of researcher, clinician and developer alike as morally responsible not only for ensuring that adequate protection and safeguards are in place but also for conveying their importance to the public in accessible ways105, 106, 111 while taking into account that public understandings of cybersecurity84 and attitudes towards data sharing are diverse.83, 85 Public engagement in professional education is another important future avenue towards improving the safety and acceptability of new AI‐assisted practices.63, 164, 165

4.3 Public engagement in the planning, development, implementation, evaluation and diffusion of AI technologies

4.3.1 New contexts and opportunities for PPI

There is strong preliminary evidence that data‐intensive technologies can enhance PPI in research and caregiving. For example, public engagement in clinical research is being facilitated by the rapid transition to Internet‐based trials.166 Multiple studies reported that data collection and analysis techniques could enable patients to take an active role in their care through self‐monitoring,62, 78, 84, 152, 167 to contribute experiential insights into service‐orientated research,63 to maintain motivation and adherence to treatment,97, 168 or to facilitate engagement with clinicians, other patients, or friends and family.59, 72, 106 The development of creative digital approaches includes the following: online communities, digitization and redesign of psychology interventions, biometrics and data‐driven approaches, creative sharing of stories, symbolic engagements, and creative offerings of comfort and encouragements of self‐care.169

As such, data‐intensive technologies offer new possibilities for relationship‐based involvement (eg based on a patient's support network), especially for people with severe psychiatric disorders where good outcomes often entail the involvement of informal caregivers.75, 118 However, in the clinical context, carers may feel separated and distanced from the technical aspects of data gathering and analysis.

Data‐intensive technologies could break new ground in PPI for service design and quality improvement, for example as media for relaying real‐time feedback on service quality77 and patient‐reported outcomes (PRO),170 or for engaging underserved populations who are less likely to engage with specific services for sustained periods of time.73, 93, 146

Co‐design of virtual reality (VR) scenarios with young people shows promise,171 but little is known about the safety of implementing immersive VR technologies in sensitive settings.172 It is known that patient engagement in such technologies is negatively affected by poorly designed features, bugs and didactic information giving.104, 173 Other needs depend upon the type of user, for example those with severe insomnia101 or people who are homeless,174 and the practical/annoyance issues of using technologies. Wearable technologies tend to address a specific use case/health area, such as bedwetting175; however, this could result in non‐scalable and 'silo' solutions.176

Despite multiple examples of co‐design of mental health technologies (mostly apps or Web‐based information) with children and young people,67, 177, 178, 179, 180 future work will need to consider diversity in the user group, for example children experiencing psychosis.181

4.3.2 Public awareness, preference and choice

The sheer diversity of data‐driven solutions to mental health drastically expands the available choices patients and the public face about whether to engage with such technologies or become involved in their design and implementation. Digital technologies could make it easier for some patients and broader publics to be involved in self‐care, caregiving, research and service design remotely and at flexible times. At the same time, other people might find themselves, or choose to be part of, a new minority of ‘others’ across a digital divide.

In one study, user design and testing of a Web‐based portal for dementia showed users felt an increased sense of autonomy and found the portal to be user‐friendly, helpful and efficient but felt that more information should be accessible.182 Moreover, data can be collected passively or through active user engagement (eg automatically tracked UV exposure vs. user‐inputted data on daily activities); various options can appeal for some patients and not others.62, 183 Clinicians prefer some technologies as opposed to others,59, 72, 78, 103 depending on features, functionalities or approaches. This has implications for involvement choices as some patients could be more likely to get involved in design of game‐based approaches,184 real‐world stories or problem‐solving tasks.73 Nevertheless, technologies can and should be adaptable to variability in individual preferences.65, 66, 185 and cultural contexts of use.73, 104, 186

4.3.3 Patient and public trust

Patient trust is a major concern throughout the literature,187 not least because negative past experiences of care and fears of self‐disclosure and stigma have been known to fray service users' trust in mental health‐care providers.59, 95 Interestingly, chatbots and anonymous digital reporting have been found to increase patients' willingness to disclose sensitive information about their mental health.77, 95 Patients have even suggested that professional training makes greater use of virtual reality spaces to see things from the patient's perspective.188

Other studies caution that data‐intensive technologies may complicate relationships and information sharing.26, 152, 189 The health‐care provider, be they a person, avatar or computer program, requires good interpersonal competencies to build a working relationship ‘bond’ with the client190 and to inspire feelings of fondness,191 privacy, security83, 84, 85, 160, 192 and responsiveness.193

5 DISCUSSION

AI technologies are being used to tackle many mental health challenges, including meeting service demand,194 supporting service improvement, improving access to clinicians, integrating care and support networks and eliciting feedback about services.195 A data‐rich AI‐assisted health environment holds great promise as a means to overcome enduring points of weakness in contemporary PPI initiatives, such that PPI can become more inclusive, wider reaching and accessible. Figure 3 illustrates the interrelationships between the themes of our results to provide an overview of an agenda for the future development of PPI in AI technologies for mental health described below.

FIGURE 3 PPI in the conception and transition to AI‐assisted mental health care

5.1 Four principles for design justice in AI

5.1.1 Meaningful and authentic public engagement in all areas of AI technologies can be supported and guided by the core principle that such technologies should sustain, heal, connect and empower people and communities

Design of AI technologies for mental health can be widened from a focus on addressing a problem of service demand, towards improving quality and safety, and protecting holistic well‐being from the perspective of diverse patients and healthy people. By developing inclusion frameworks that engage patients and healthy people, innovative AI technologies for mental health can be centred on the voices of those who are directly affected by the outcomes of the design process.17, 196, 197, 198 Practically or figuratively, putting digital intelligence into the hands of the person could enable them to take more control of their own health and well‐being. There is a need to encourage cultures of technology development that actively and ambitiously engage with people who are affected by the outcomes of such work—including groups of the public who stand to experience the worst effects or miss out on the benefits of technological innovations.

5.1.2 Substantial ethical concerns, such as inequalities, cultural and population biases, safety, acceptability and broader socio‐political issues, could be better understood and moderated if design focused on the concerns of the community over the intentions of the designer

The case for public engagement is more complex in relation to those design processes that do not formally lie within the publicly funded sphere,199, 200 for example social media giants and technology designers who sell directly to the public. In practical terms, developing PPI in such territory means connecting communities of practice around issues, mobilizing the knowledge and expertise that exists in both public and private sectors, and finding avenues to incentivize and value PPI through existing regulatory, governance and public accountability structures.90

5.1.3 AI technologies need to emerge from an accountable, accessible and collaborative process that describes how patients and the public have been involved

The literature reviewed here supports a call to approach the design of data‐intensive technologies as an ethical and political issue, as opposed to strictly technical.6, 7, 10, 13, 201, 202 There is a need to examine and challenge current power asymmetries (access to funding and networking, for example) in processes of designing AI technologies that will affect patients and the public, not just in the use or application of those technologies. PPI should play a central role in addressing the relative lack of guidelines for design and best practice in AI‐assisted care56, 85, 107, 117, 160 if data‐rich care tools are to be trusted as both effective and fair.26, 111, 116, 161

5.1.4 AI developers and their designs can be informed by, and contribute to, shared knowledge in design and tools to support design justice

This is particularly important in relation to building shared knowledge about new contexts and opportunities for formal PPI, understanding the level of public awareness, preferences and choice, and tackling issues of trust and power/privilege between different actors in the system. Given that a lack of transparency about patient data remains a major concern for UK mental health activists,80 collective data ownership arrangements203 and open dialogues about the role of patient and public work in the production and interpretation of data21, 170 could help to build trust and willingness to engage in the design of AI‐assisted mental health care.

These principles offer some needed guidance about the public's role in imagining new uses of AI and creating the types of technologies that patients and the public need and want. PPI offers some way to counter the hegemony of commercial applications of AI and to create a more inclusive future through collaborative design. Further research is needed to explore how collaborative design can embed diverse values and socio‐cultural conceptions of human behaviour into digital machines. We have not addressed the issue of how appropriate inclusion frameworks can be developed at different levels of technology decision making and design or how commitment to these principles can be secured. The headline message of the UK 2019 State of the Nation Survey on accelerating AI in health and care was ‘Ground AI in ‘problems’ as expressed by the users of the health system’. From our analysis, we argue that this message needs to now include the fact that in some cases, the problem might be the AI.

6 CONCLUSION

The new data‐rich digital era creates multiple ethical issues and opportunities for public engagement in health and for development of formalized PPI in the design of AI‐assisted health care. Within the various bodies of research and innovation we have examined, we have found that patients and clinicians are generally in favour of data‐driven approaches to mental health as mechanisms for producing and mobilizing knowledge on the lived experience of patients outside clinical settings. Further research is needed to understand modes of public engagement in the different socio‐political, clinical and lived contexts of use of AI technologies, to examine the ethics of AI‐assisted health care and to develop new methods of PPI at every stage, from concept design to the final review of technologies in practice. PPI is a necessity for aligning advances in AI with egalitarian goals of equality, diversity and inclusion.

Mixed‐methods study

	Mobile apps for sleep disturbance	People with poor sleep and insomnia participated in qualitative (2 focus groups n = 9 and app reviews) and quantitative (online survey) approaches. (N = 9). An online survey tested themes identified from the focus groups against a larger population (N = 167). In addition, 434 user reviews of 6 mobile apps available on app stores.	This co‐design process involving end users through 3 methods consistently highlighted sleep tracking (through a diary and WD), alarms, and personalization as vital for engagement, although their implementation was commonly criticized in review. Engagement is negatively affected by poorly designed features, bugs, and didactic information which must be addressed. Other needs depend upon the type of user, for example, those with severe insomnia.	Australia

systematic assessment of apps for Arabic speakers

	Mobile apps for depression and anxiety for Arabic speakers	Review of 23 depression and anxiety apps, available free of charge to Arabic speakers.

(no direct public engagement)

	The results of this study clearly highlight the current gaps to address the needs of Arabic speakers‐ 16 apps provided general information about anxiety or depression, others focused on spirituality or herbal medicine. There is a need to involve expert health‐care professionals in the development of mental health apps and for health‐care providers to empower patients through discussing apps that are useful and discern them from those that can potentially cause harm.

Qualitative research

	Monitoring early signs of psychosis relapse	149 mental health professionals, carers, and people diagnosed with psychosis participated in 25 focus groups in both Australia and the United Kingdom. An interview schedule informed by the normalization process theory was used to explore stakeholders' expectations about the implementation of the EMPOWER intervention.	A hypothetical implementation framework synthesized from stakeholder implementation expectations provides an opportunity to compare actual implementation data gathered during an on‐going clinical trial, giving valuable insights into the accuracy of these stakeholders' previous expectations. This is among the first studies to assess and record implementation expectations for a newly developed digital intervention for psychosis in advance of testing in a clinical trial.	UK/Australia

Review

	Wearable patient monitoring systems	Review of barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings.	A review of WPM systems using advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. Most studies focused on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor‐software integration to solve a specific use case/health area using non‐scalable and 'silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges.	New Zealand

Review

	Online clinical trials	Review of online trials to determine how many trials have used internet‐based technologies; how they have been used; and how use has developed over time to build an open access resource to support a public‐led research agenda (no direct public engagement)	The review found 1992 internet‐based trials to March 2015. The number of reported studies increased substantially over the study timeframe. The largest number of trials were conducted in the USA (49.7%), followed by The Netherlands (10.2%); Australia (8.5%); the United Kingdom (5.8%); Sweden (4.6%); Canada (4%); and Germany (2.6%). There is a predominance of interventions addressing core public health challenges including obesity (8.6%), smoking cessation (5.9%), alcohol abuse (7.7%) and physical activity (10.2%); in mental health issues such as depression (10.9%) and anxiety (5.6%); and conditions where self‐management (16.6%) or monitoring (8.1%) is a major feature of care.

review

	Digital post‐traumatic support	Review of current approaches to supporting mental well‐being outside of therapy	This article offers a reflection on possibilities for co‐design in a digital economy. Six themes of creative approaches from 83 existing interventions: online communities, digitization and redesign of psychology intervention, biometrics and data‐driven, creative sharing of stories, symbolic engagements, and creative offerings of comfort and encouragements of self‐care. Involvement of trusted others in the co‐design of care entanglements is proposed, suggesting that these involvements would allow for reciprocal care encounters to be personalized towards those who have experienced trauma and their trusted others.

Co‐design of app

	Early signs of distress in psychosis	Co‐design with patients and stakeholders Actissist is a theory‐informed smartphone app targeting distress in early psychosis.	The success of digital health interventions is not merely determined by patient uptake it will ultimately be determined by patients and staff, both of whom are key end‐users. Mental health professionals and patients often express concerns about data security, safety and risk information being robustly handled.	UK	
Bucci 2019	Research:

Review

	Digital health technology in mental health	Reviews of digital health technology assessment and intervention primarily in secondary service mental health care, including the barriers and facilitators to adopting and implementing digitally mediated interventions in service delivery.	These developments point to a need for both theory‐ and data‐driven approaches to digital health care. More advanced methodologies are needed to keep up with the pace of digital technology development. The need for co‐production of digital tools with and for people with chronic and mental health difficulties, and implications of digital technology for psychotherapy practice, will be central to this development.

Buitenweg 2019	Research:

co‐creative development

	Personalized quality of life assessment app for people with severe mental health problems	3 groups of individuals with severe mental health problems: (1) people with psychiatric problems, (2) people treated in forensic psychiatry, and (3) people who are homeless. A group of 59 participants contributed to the 6 iterations of the co‐creative development of the QoL‐ME.	In the brainstorming stage, participants stressed the importance of privacy and data security and of receiving feedback when answering questionnaires. Participants in the design stage indicated a preference for paging over scrolling, linear navigation, a clean and minimalist layout, the use of touchscreen functionality in various modes of interaction, and the use of visual analogue scales. The usability evaluation in the usability stage revealed good to excellent usability. The co‐creative development of the QoL‐ME resulted in an app that corresponds to the preferences of participants and has strong usability. Further research is needed to evaluate the psychometric quality of the QoL‐ME and to investigate its usefulness in practice.	The Netherlands	
Caswell 2020	Research:

Product development and testing

	Product development for bedwetting (MyPAD)	A PPI workshop in the form of a focus group, made up of children and their parents, was conducted during the early stage of the MyPAD product development. The key research questions were: What were the families’ experiences of using existing post‐void enuresis alarms? What do families like about the MyPAD prototype? and What do families not like about the MyPAD prototype?	The qualitative data derived from the focus group discussion was incredibly valuable as it enabled the research and design team to experience the perspectives of the families in terms of the challenges and conflicts of managing the condition and the limited utility of existing post‐void alarms. This has improved the researcher's understanding of the social and environmental challenges that need to be considered during the design process.	UK

	Gamifying CBT to deliver emotional health treatment to young people on smartphones	Focus groups and interactive workshops with New Zealand, Māori and Pasifika youth were used to inform the co‐design process. Clinicians worked iteratively with experienced game designers to co‐create a youth CBT digital intervention.	Gamifying CBT involves selecting suitable interventions, adapting them to a digital format while applying gamification principles. The Quest modular app is set on an ocean and the user travels between islands to learn six evidence‐based skills. These include a relaxation/mindfulness activity, activity planning, a gratitude journal plus problem‐solving and communication skills training. Gamified features aim to increase user engagement.

biomedical data types and AI technologies

	Sex and gender gaps in a subset of biomedical technologies used in precision medicine	Review of AI technologies (no direct public engagement)

	Most of the currently used biomedical AI technologies do not account for bias detection. The design of the majority of algorithms ignore the sex and gender dimension and its contribution to health and disease differences among individuals. Failure in accounting for these differences will generate sub‐optimal results and produce mistakes as well as discriminatory outcomes.	Spain

counselling service research

	Mobile technologies for stress management	Counselling centre clinicians and students at two large Midwestern universities. Clinicians completed online questionnaires on their current practices and interest in digital mental health tools. Students and clinicians completed co‐design workshops. In subsequent individual interviews, students identified barriers to care.	Students and clinicians recognize barriers to face‐to‐face therapy and are eager to collaborate to identify opportunities to address barriers to mental health services using digital mental health tools as a potential opportunity for support. The authors describe the benefits of including students in discussions of treatment resources.	USA

Mixed‐methods descriptive study

	Perceptions of realism in digital scenarios for mental health nurse education	A co‐productive active learning approach explored perceptions of authenticity using an authenticity scale. Stakeholder facilitated workshop discussions explored perceptions of the educational scenarios. Participants included mental health nursing students, people with lived experience and family carers. A mixed‐methods descriptive study using the adapted authenticity scale to rate four exemplar scenarios along with thematic analysis of workshop discussions.	Digital audio compared less well to visual media in authenticity scales. Still photobook‐style images were also perceived as less authentic than dramatic film employing professional actors. Digital media must be selected carefully not just in relation to the education needs of the student but in relation to their social, cultural norms and digital skills. Creating digital scenarios co‐productively could contribute to a teaching resource that holds authenticity and real‐world relevance.	UK

Qualitative exploration of the suitability of digital stories as pedagogical tools

	Digital storytelling as an approach designed to apply the theory of authentic learning in a co‐productive context	A participant group (n = 7) comprising family carers, people with lived experience and mental health nursing students were invited to join two facilitated workshops. The group reviewed four contrasting forms of digital stories with the aim of eliciting and sharing their perspectives.	Digital audio compared less well to visual media in authenticity scales. Still photobook‐style images were also perceived to be less authentic than dramatic film employing professional actors. Furthermore, it was found that the essence of authenticity became richer as the process and activities of co‐productive engagement developed. It is proposed that creating digital scenarios co‐productively provides a relational environment in which the essence of authenticity can be felt and expressed.	UK

Co‐design method

	Design of a visualization toolbox for people to track their mental health	A participant co‐design methodology, Double Diamond from the Design Council (Great Britain), was used. Two design workshops were held with 13 and 12 experts by experience involved, respectively, including two peer researchers (co‐authors) and two individual‐carer dyads in each workshop, with over 50% of those being present in both workshops.	While participants concurred on a range of typical dimensions of well‐being, the individual visualizations generated were in contrast to the techniques currently employed by existing digital well‐being apps and there was a great diversity in preference for different visualization types. Participants considered personal visualizations to be useful as self‐administered interventions or as a step towards seeking help, as well as being tools for self‐appraisal.	UK	
Crosby 2020	Research:

Qualitative research

	Self‐care for depression and anxiety	Interview study of 14 individuals living in England with a diagnosis of depression or an anxiety disorder, who used smartphone apps as part of self‐care.	People engage with apps in a straightforward and uncomplicated manner, leading to immediate symptomatic alleviation, but to limited longer term benefit. The contradiction between the apps’ promise as tools of individual empowerment, with their ability to promote responsibilizing frameworks that restrain users’ reflexivity, is central to their implications. Apps can thus contribute to isolation from interpersonal support and promote reductionist biomedical conceptualizations of mental ill health.	UK

With developments in data resources and analytical techniques, guidelines are beginning to include evidence from robust observational pharmacoepidemiological studies alongside randomized controlled trials. Collaboration between guideline writers and researchers involved in pharmacoepidemiology could help researchers to answer the questions that are important to policy makers and ensure that results are integrated into the evidence base. Further development of statistical and data science techniques, alongside public engagement and capacity building (data resources and researcher base), will be necessary to take full advantage of future opportunities.

Dewa 2019	Research:

qualitative study

	Young adults’ perceptions of using wearables, social media and other technologies to detect worsening mental health	The study was co‐produced with 16 young adults with past mental health difficulties. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with young adults with a severe mental health condition in a private room at a community mental health site. Data was triangulated by comparing codes and ideas across the two co‐researchers and two researchers over two virtual meetings. Themes were finalized and presented in a thematic map.	Involvement of young adults revealed four main themes: dealing with mental health symptoms, signs of mental health deterioration, technology concerns and technological applications to identify worsening mental health. Wearables and mobile apps were considered acceptable and feasible to detect mental health deterioration in real‐time if they could measure changes in sleep patterns, mood or activity levels as signs of deterioration. Getting help earlier was deemed essential particularly in reference to dissatisfaction with the current non‐technological mental health services. However, patients identified issues to consider before implementation including practicality, safeguarding and patient preference. Wearables and mobile apps could be viable technological options to help detect deterioration in young people in order to intervene early and avoid delay in accessing mental health services. However, immediate action following detection is required for the patient to trust and use the intervention.	UK

Qualitative interviews

	Online intervention for bipolar disorder	Participants from a research trial who had been allocated to receive ERPonline were purposively sampled (n = 19) to participate in telephone‐based, in‐depth qualitative interviews about their experiences.	Participants took part due to the convenient, flexible and rewarding aspects of the trial design, as well as a desire to improve the mental health of themselves and others. Barriers included extensive assessments, practical difficulties and mood. ERPonline was generally considered to be accessible, relevant and straightforward, but there were individual preferences regarding design, content and who it was for. Several participants reported positive changes, but there was a sense that digital interventions should not replace routine care. There are a number of barriers and facilitators to consider when evaluating and implementing digital interventions. Individual preferences and human contact were key factors for both trial design and engagement with an online intervention.	UK

scoping processes

	Digital therapy for adolescent mental health	Interactive workshops and focus groups were held with young people. Participants (N = 58) engaged in 2 whānau (extended family) focus groups (n = 4 and n = 5), 2 school‐ or community‐based focus groups (n = 9 each), and 2 workshops (n = 11 and n = 20).	The authors identified 3 overarching themes: (1) Digital mental health tools are unlikely to be successful if they rely solely on youth help‐seeking. (2) A single approach is unlikely to appeal to all. Participants had diverse, non‐compatible preferences in terms of look or feel of an app or digital tool. The authors identified 4 user groups players or gamers, engagers, sceptics, and straight‐talkers. These groups differed by age and degree of current mental health need and preferred gamified or fun approaches, were open to a range of approaches, were generally disinterested, or preferred direct‐to‐the‐point, serious approaches, respectively. (3) Digital mental health tools should provide an immediate response to a range of different issues and challenges that a young person may face. Defining the preferences of different groups of users may be important for increasing engagement with digital therapies even within specific population and mental health–need groups. This study demonstrates the importance of scoping possible user needs to inform design processes.	New Zealand

	Design of a smartphone game for adolescent mental health	Person‐centred approach including focus group discussions with (n = 46) student participants and co‐design workshops with (n = 22) student participants and user testing with (n = 50) student participants. Participants were aged 12‐17 y and recruited from local schools in New Delhi and Goa, including a subgroup with self‐identified mental health needs (n = 6).	Formative data from existing primary sources, new focus groups and co‐design workshops supported a blended format for delivering a brief problem‐solving intervention. User testing with prototypes identified a need for simplification of language, use of concrete examples of concepts and practice elements to enhance engagement. There were also indications that participants most valued relatability and interactivity within real‐world stories with judicious support from an in‐app guide. The final prototype comprised a set of interactive and gamified vignettes and a structured set of problem‐solving questions to consolidate and generalize learning while encouraging real‐world application.

Goodyear‐Smith 2018	Research:	Screening for risky behaviour and mental health in young people	Co‐design participatory research to assess acceptability and feasibility of YouthCHAT with successive roll‐out to clinics.	Opportunistic screening for mental health concerns and other risky health behaviours during adolescence can yield significant health gains and prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. The systematic approaches to screening and provision of algorithms for stepped‐care intervention will assist in delivering time efficient, early, more comprehensive interventions for youth with mental health concerns and other health compromising behaviours. The early detection of concerns and facilitation to evidence‐based interventions has the potential to lead to improved health outcomes, particularly for underserved indigenous populations.

Graham 2019	Discussion drawing on research studies	AI in predicting, diagnosing and classifying neurocognitive impairments	Discussion paper providing a conceptual overview of AI application (no direct public engagement)	This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use, benefits, and limitations of AI for predicting, diagnosing, and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments, by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. The authors present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: (1) sociodemographics; (2) clinical and psychometric assessments; (3) neuroimaging and neurophysiology; (4) electronic health records and claims; (5) novel assessments (eg sensors for digital data); and (6) genomics/other omics. For each category they provide examples of AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning, and natural language processing. They conclude that AI technology, still nascent in health care, has great potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat patients with neurocognitive disorders.	USA

Hodson 2019	Research:	Crisis planning for young people	Community‐based project to collaboratively research, design and test an integrated digital crisis planning tool for youth ages 13‐24. The project was established with several guiding principles: that students should act as the front line researchers and designers with the guidance of faculty and community partners; that we should aim to move beyond consultation to truly participatory design methods involving end users in needs identification, idea generation, design development and testing; and that by having the students interface with the end users, we would alter the power balance by building trust and avoiding a top‐down approach.	Giving the students responsibility for much of the interaction with the end users had risks. The seriousness of the project and its potential for real impact –positive or negative ‐inspired the students to perform at an even higher level. They identified with the issue of mental health, a high‐profile subject on campuses right now, and they wanted to use their design training to help others. Their dedication to the project grew stronger as they became accountable to real ‘clients’ who were even more invested in the outcome.	USA

	Sensing technology to monitor behavioural and psychological symptoms and to assess treatment response in people with dementia	Review of studies of sensing technologies in dementia (no direct public engagement)	34 studies of (1) wearable sensors, (2) non‐wearable motion sensor technologies, and (3) assistive technologies/smart home technologies. Half of the studies investigated how temporarily dense data on motion can be utilized as a proxy for behaviour, such as sleep disturbances, agitation and wandering. Up to half of the studies represented proof of concept, acceptability and/or feasibility testing. Overall, the technology was regarded as non‐intrusive and well accepted. The authors highlight awareness of legal regulations, data risk assessment, and patient and public involvement, with a necessary framework for sustainable ethical innovation in health‐care technology. The success of this field will depend on interdisciplinary cooperation and the advance in sustainable ethic innovation.	Norway

mixed‐methods (quantitative and qualitative) feasibility evaluation

	Digital intervention for adolescent depression	Adolescents (n = 44) with or at elevated risk of depression and their parents and carers (n = 31) were recruited from mental health services, school counsellors and nurses, and participants from a previous study. 82% completed questionnaires before and after the programme related to the feasibility and acceptability of the programme and evaluation process, and changes in mood, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour, and their Web usage was monitored. A subsample of 19 were interviewed	Key themes from the interviews and groups related to the design features, sections and content, and integration and context of the programme in the young person's life. Overall, the participants found the intervention engaging, clear, user‐friendly, and comprehensive, and stated that it could be integrated into existing services. Young people found the ‘Self‐help’ section and ‘Mood monitor’ particularly helpful. The findings provided initial support for the intervention programme theory, for example, depression literacy improved after using the intervention. Findings from this early stage evaluation suggest that MoodHwb and the assessment process were feasible and acceptable, and that the intervention has the potential to be helpful for young people, families and carers as an early intervention programme in health, education, social, and youth services and charities. The authors suggest a randomized controlled trial is needed to further evaluate the digital programme.	UK

Review

	Psychotherapy apps	Review of the ethical challenges presented by direct‐to‐consumer (DTC) digital psychotherapy services that do not involve oversight by a professional mental health provider (no direct public involvement)	In a DTC therapy app, there are no clear lines of accountability or associated ethical obligations to protect the user seeking mental health services. The types of DTC services that present ethical challenges include apps that use a digital platform to connect users to minimally trained non‐professional counsellors, as well as services that provide counselling steered by artificial intelligence and conversational agents. There is a need for adequate oversight of DTC non‐professional psychotherapy services and additional empirical research to inform policy that will provide protection to the consumer.	USA

Systems improvement

	Data elicited through apps for health systems improvement	Experience‐based co‐design (EBCD) study involving youth with mental disorders (aged 16‐24), family members, and service providers to capture participant feedback on the myEXP apps.	Overall, the myEXP apps were more effective at eliciting experience data from youth compared with family members and service providers. Apps offer an appealing tool to elicit data from patients and family members who may feel stigma when receiving some services and a power imbalance when providing feedback to health‐care providers. Rich experience data were gathered from youth about treatment plans in real time through the apps. The apps also showed important promise as reflective tools for all participants. They may offer advantages in research that seeks to improve responsiveness in service delivery and build mutual understanding. The apps also offer choice in how data are elicited, encourage more candid feedback and help to overcome stigma, which are important considerations for some vulnerable populations. For service redesign research using approaches such as EBCD, apps offer real‐time data gathering that can complement and enhance traditional approaches such as retrospective interviews and observation.

digital methods of patient feedback

	Implementation of a particular digital feedback intervention that was co‐designed with health professionals and patients (the DEPEND study)	Qualitative data was collected through interviews and focus groups with professionals, patients and carers. In total 51 staff, 24 patients and 8 carers were included. Forty‐two observations of the use of the digital feedback system were carried out in the four settings. Data analysis was based on modified grounded theory and Normalization Process Theory (NPT) formed the conceptual framework.	Patients had a range of views depending on their familiarity with the digital world. Patients mentioned barriers such as kiosk not being visible, privacy, lack of digital know‐how, technical hitches with the touchscreen. Collective action in maintaining participation again differed between sites because of workload pressure, perceptions of roles and responsibilities; and in the mental health site major organizational change was taking place. For mental health service users, their relationship with staff and their own health status determined their digital use. The potential of digital feedback was recognized but implementation should take local contexts, different patient groups and organizational leadership into account. Patient involvement in change and adaptation of the intervention was important in enhancing the embedding of digital methods in routine feedback. NPT allowed for an in‐depth understanding of actions and interactions of both staff and patients.	UK

	Health information technologies for mental health care	Using participatory design methodologies with Colombian end users (young people, their supportive others, and health professionals), this study aimed to conduct co‐design workshops to culturally adapt a Web‐based Mental Health eClinic (MHeC) for young people.	This community‐based participatory research involved the utilization of a research and development (R&D) cycle including 4 iterative phases: co‐design workshops; knowledge translation; tailoring to language, culture, and place (or context); and one‐on‐one user testing sessions. 2 co‐design workshops were held with 18 users‐young people (n = 7) and health professionals (n = 11). 10 users participated in one‐on‐one user testing sessions‐young people (n = 5), supportive others (n = 2), and health professionals (n = 3). Participants liked the idea of having an MHeC designed and adapted for Colombian young people, and its 5 key elements were acceptable in this context (home page and triage system, self‐report assessment, dashboard of results, booking and video‐visit system, and personalized well‐being plan). However, to be relevant in Colombia, participants stressed the need to develop additional functionality (eg, phone network backup; chat; geolocation; and integration with electronic medical records, apps, or electronic tools) as well as an adaptation of the self‐report assessment. Importantly, the latter not only included language but also culture and context.	Colombia

Meta synthesis of qualitative literature on service user's views of DHIs

	Digital health interventions for adults with depression	Systematic review of service users’ views and experiences regarding the acceptability and usability of DHIs for depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders (no direct public engagement)

	A total of 24 studies were included in the meta‐synthesis, and 3 key themes emerged with descriptive subthemes. The 3 key themes were initial motivations and approaches to DHIs, personalization of treatment, and the value of receiving personal support in DHIs. The meta‐synthesis suggests that participants’ initial beliefs about DHIs can have an important effect on their engagement with these types of interventions. Personal support was valued very highly as a major component of the success of DHIs. The main reason for this was the way it enabled individual personalization of care. The findings have implications for the design of future DHIs to improve uptake, retention, and outcomes in DHIs for depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders.	UK

They did not want personalized/normative feedback, but thought that every student should be offered all the help options. Participants identified key principles: assurance of confidentiality, usability, participant choice and control, and language. They highlighted wording as important for ease and comfort, and emphasized the importance of user control. Participants expressed that it would be useful and acceptable for survey respondents to receive information about digital help options addressing a range of health and well‐being topics. The methodology of adolescent‐practitioner‐researcher collaboration and partnership was central to this research and provided useful insights for the development and delivery of adolescent health surveys integrated with digital help options. The results from the study provide useful data on the impact of digital health interventions integrated in large‐scale surveys, as a novel methodology.	New Zealand

Observational study of subjective well‐being (SWB)

	Well‐being in co‐creation	Consumer‐grounded view (no direct public engagement)	The study measures how community affiliation, personal growth and utilitarian motives are predictors of subjective well‐being (SWB). The results illustrate that community affiliation and personal growth motives predict high scores of SWB, while utilitarian motives do not. In addition, empowered consumers who co‐create with others are happier than consumers who create alone. This indicates that direct interactions are not only a powerful platform for service co‐creation, but are also predictors of SWB. Traditional companies and decision makers can use benefits offered by digital fabrication services.	Italy

report from a multi‐stakeholder meeting

	Advancing e‐mental health	The need for e‐mental health (electronic mental health) services was discussed at the 9th Annual Canadian E‐Mental Health Conference held in Toronto, Canada.	Given the large number of people requiring mental health care in Canada, this model of care delivery is not sufficient in its current form. E‐mental health technologies may offer an important solution to the problem. Themes that emerged from the discussions at the conference include (1) the importance of trust, transparency, human centredness, and compassion in the development and delivery of digital mental health technologies; (2) an emphasis on equity, diversity, inclusion, and access when implementing e‐mental health services; (3) the need to ensure that the mental health workforce is able to engage in a digital way of working; and (4) co‐production of e‐mental health services among a diverse stakeholder group becoming the standard way of working.

Analysis of social media posts

	Detection of mental illness	Language samples were collected from the social media website Reddit, drawing on posts to discussion groups focusing on different kinds of mental illness (clinical subreddits), as well as on posts to discussion groups focusing on non‐mental health topics (non‐clinical subreddits).	Words drawn from the clinical subreddits could be used to distinguish several kinds of mental illness (ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression). Interestingly, words drawn from the non‐clinical subreddits (eg travel, cooking, cars) could also be used to distinguish different categories of mental illness, implying that the impact of mental illness spills over into topics unrelated to mental illness. Most importantly, words derived from the non‐clinical subreddits predicted future postings to clinical subreddits, implying that everyday language contains signal about the likelihood of future mental illness, possibly before people are aware of their mental health condition. Finally, whereas models trained on clinical subreddits learned to focus on words indicating disorder‐specific symptoms, models trained to predict future mental illness learned to focus on words indicating life stress, suggesting that kinds of features that are predictive of mental illness may change over time.

	Patient‐driven innovation for mental health	The case is co‐written with an individual with schizophrenia, who openly shares his name and personal experience with mental health technology in order to educate and inspire others.	The authors argue that there is a clear advantage for patient voice to be heard: so we can all learn from their experiences at the direct intersection of mental health and technology innovation. This paper is the first in JMIR Mental Health's patient perspective series from those with lived experience.	USA

Turvey 2019	Research:

Review

	Electronic health records	Review of the evidence base on electronic health records (no direct public engagement)	Electronic health records combined with tethered patient portals now support a range of functions including electronic data capture of patient‐reported outcomes, trend reporting on clinical targets, secure messaging, and patient‐mediated health information exchange. The applications of these features require special consideration in psychiatric and behavioural health settings. Nonetheless, their potential to engage patients suffering from disorders in which passivity and withdrawal are endemic to their mental health condition, is great.	USA	
Vacca 2019	Research:

Co‐design

	Emotional health communication support for parents and teens	Participatory design study with eight Latina teens, a tool and memes that challenge parental assumptions about Latina teen norms and behaviour were co‐designed.	Latina youth viewed technology as a tool for creative argumentation that enacted certain cultural practices. In turn, Latina parents reflected on the authoritative source of the memes reconciling the subjective argumentation of the teen voice with the perceived objectivity of open data incorporated into the memes. Drawing on theories of brokering and Latina emotional health, we present theoretical and design ideas for supporting Latinas to improve teen‐caregiver relationships through digital media creation platforms.

van Os 2015	Research:

Clinical study

	Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM)	34 patients with major depressive disorder, treated with antidepressants, the combined effect of treatment and natural course was examined over a period of 18 weeks with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). EMA consisted of repeated, within‐subject, mini‐measurements of experience (eg positive affect, negative affect, medication side‐effects) and context (eg stressors, situations, activities) at 10 unselected semi‐random moments per day, for a period of 6 d, repeated three times over the 18‐week period (baseline, week 6 and week 18).	Novel mHealth technology makes it possible to collect real life, in‐the‐moment ambulatory data that allow for an ecologically valid assessment of personalized and contextualized emotional and behavioural adjustment in the flow daily life (mROM). This study supports the use of mROM as a means to involve the patient in the process of needs assessment and treatment. EMA data are meaningful to the patient, as they reflect daily life circumstances. Assessment of treatment response with mROM data allows for an interpretation of the effect of treatment at the level of daily life emotional and social adjustment – as an index of health, obviating the need for an exclusive focus on traditional measures of sickness.

Quantitative evaluation

	Digital well‐being interventions for people with intellectual disabilities	Digital intervention, developed with and for people with intellectual disabilities, to improve their subjective well‐being. Using a single‐group pre‐post design, 12 participants with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers completed the 4‐week intervention.	Participant acceptability of the intervention was high, and feedback covered multiple aspects of the intervention, including (1) programme concept and design, (2) programme content, and (3) intervention usage. The study shows people with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers are receptive to using digital well‐being interventions and such interventions are feasible in routine practice.	Germany

Review

	Internet use by people with schizophrenia	Review of the literature on people with schizophrenia's use of the internet for mental health information (no direct public engagement)	People experiencing schizophrenia spectrum disorders or other psychotic disorders wish to find on the Internet trustful, non‐stigmatizing information about their disease, flexibility, security standards, and positive peer‐to‐peer exchanges. E‐mental health also appears to be desired by a substantial proportion of them.	France	
Vugts 2020	Study protocol for a controlled trial and process evaluation	Serious gaming during multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients with complex chronic pain or fatigue complaints	This controlled trial demonstrates patient engagement through embedded qualitative methods include unobtrusive collection and analyses of stakeholder focus group interviews, participant feedback and semi‐structured patient interviews.	An experimental group is composed of patients who follow serious gaming during an outpatient multidisciplinary programme at two sites of a Dutch rehabilitation centre. Selected participants will contribute their views and experiences about gaming as part of their care.	The Netherlands

Model development

	Big data analytics	Model developed by analysing big data implementation cases (no direct public engagement)	In addition to conceptually defining four big data analytics capabilities, the model offers a strategic view of big data analytics. Three significant path‐to‐value chains were identified for health‐care organizations by applying the model, which provides practical insights for managers.	UK

Theory building

	Theory‐driven user‐centric explainable AI (XAI)	Review of empirical application‐specific investigations of XAI exploring theoretical underpinnings of human decision making, drawing from the fields of philosophy and psychology. (no direct public engagement)	Proposes a conceptual framework for building human‐centred, decision‐theory‐driven XAI. Drawing on this framework, the authors identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. They put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co‐design exercise with clinicians.

Qualitative research

	Intelligent Assistive Technology (IAT)	Explores the ethical issues of IATs in elderly and dementia care from a professional perspective (no direct public engagement)	Professional stakeholders find issues of patient autonomy and informed consent, quality of data management, distributive justice and human contact as ethical priorities. Divergences emerged in relation to how these ethical issues are interpreted, how conflicts between different ethical principles are resolved and what solutions should be implemented to overcome current challenges.	Switzerland	
Waycott 2018	Conference workshop	Virtual reality for therapy	Conference workshop with professional/public audience	Virtual reality (VR) is now being designed and deployed in diverse sensitive settings, especially for therapeutic purposes. For example, VR experiences are used for diversional therapy in aged care and as therapy for people living with conditions such as phobias and post‐traumatic stress. While these uses of VR offer great promise, they also present significant challenges. Given the novelty of VR, its immersive nature, and its impact on the user's sense of reality, it can be particularly challenging to engage participants in co‐design and predict what might go wrong when implementing these technologies in sensitive settings.

Wentink 2019	Research:

qualitative

	eRehabilitation programmes in stroke care	End users were involved in six focus groups with patients/informal caregivers to identify user requirements	Requirements between stroke patients/informal caregivers and health professionals differed on several aspects. Therefore, involving the perspectives of all end users in the design process of stroke eRehabilitation programmes is needed to achieve a user‐centred design.	The Netherlands	
Zhang 2019	Research:

participatory research study

	Development of an app for substance use disorders	A user‐oriented design approach, used three co‐design workshops 10 health care professionals and 10 patients to develop an app for substance use disorders	Patients critiqued the existing app, common issues identified were those of the design, visual probe task, and the included images. Outpatients were concerned with the safety of administration of the intervention. Inpatient participants recommended the addition of functionalities, such as information on the harms associated with the substance use, and for there to be enhancements in the design, images, and task. There were differences in opinion on the inclusion of gaming features, as only health‐care professionals endorsed their inclusion. The results from this research will guide the development of an app that meets the specific needs of patients and is still based on a pre‐existing validated task paradigm.	Singapore
