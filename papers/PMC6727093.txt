people aged 50 years or older in England. Beside the basic measure of two or more diseases
within a person, we added a measure of three or more affected body systems (complex
multimorbidity) and a measure of 10 or more functional limitations. We found that the
three health outcomes became more prevalent between 2002 and 2015. They were more common
among females than males and were becoming more common among younger age groups. While in
2002, the prevalence of basic multimorbidity overcame 50% from the 70–74 age group
upwards, in 2015 it crossed the same threshold in the 65–69 age group. The distribution of
multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations were stratified by the amount of
household wealth. Multiple functional limitations reflected the largest differences
between the most and the least affluent groups (5.9-fold in 2014/2015), followed by the
measure of complex multimorbidity (2.8-fold in 2014/2015) and basic multimorbidity
(1.9-fold) in 2014/2015.While age acted as a levelling factor for the wealth differences
in basic multimorbidity, it had no such effect on the two other outcomes. Our study
observed social polarization among multimorbid ageing population in England where complex
multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations increase faster and reflect stronger
inequality than basic multimorbidity.

==== Body
Background
Multimorbidity (MM) when defined as the co-occurrence of two or more diseases within a person1 is rising globally.2,3 Its prevalence among people aged 65 years or older in England is projected to rise
from 54% in 2015 to 67.8% in 2035.4 People will live longer but in worse health. The extra years lived with MM will lead
to higher utilization of primary and secondary healthcare.4 The definition of MM as two or more diseases underpinning these statistics has been
criticized for leading to prevalence estimates in the elderly population which are too high
(55–98% between studies) to be able to predict patients with higher need.5,6 Practitioners need a measure of MM that can reflect the biology of ageing and
identify elderly populations with higher healthcare needs.

Harrison et al.7 introduced the concept of complex multimorbidity (CMM), defined as ‘the co-occurrence
of three or more chronic conditions affecting three or more different body systems within
one person without an index chronic condition’.7 Compared to the basic definition of two or more conditions, the construct of CMM
leads to lower prevalence estimates and it has been proposed that it might better identify
patients with higher needs.6,7 We argue that CMM might also be better at reflecting the biology of ageing since it
characterizes a simultaneous breakdown or dysfunction of several distinct pathologies or
body systems.8,9 The affected body systems of people aged 65 or older were found as predictors of the
total number of hospital stays and of the number of hospital admissions.10


The process of ageing manifests itself not just in the number of morbidities an individual
has but also in physical functioning. A measure of multiple functional limitations (MFLs)
was included as our third health outcome. Its purpose is to identify the impact of MM on the
combined functioning of ageing people. Some conditions (e.g. high blood pressure) may have
no effect on the physical functioning but others do, such as arthritis. MM predicts a
decline in physical functioning among ageing people,11,12 which has implications for quality of life, need for healthcare, residential care and
premature mortality.11–13 Measuring MFLs also responds to the fact that the proportion of old people with
impairments and limitations in several body systems increases with age.12,14


Socio-economic status (SES) is a major determinant of health inequalities. Studies which
explored the association between MM and SES focused on area deprivation,15–17 income,18 occupational status19 and education.18,20 Regardless of the type of measure, MM is more common among people with lower SES,
even when controlling for age and sex. However, all of these studies focus on the simple
definition of MM that may hide the nuances of relationships and the true underlying scale of
inequalities.

Our study is the first population-level analysis that differentiates the prevalence of MM
by complexity and degree of functional limitation as well as their variation by key
modifying factors. The study has two aims: (1) to compare temporal trends in the prevalence
of basic MM, CMM and MFLs in an ageing population in England and (2) to examine the
variation in their prevalence by age, sex and SES.

Methods
Data and study population
We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) which is a panel study
with a range of social, economic, psychological, cognitive and health data. It is based on
a representative sample of people living in England aged 50+ years. It commenced in 2002
and is followed up every 2 years. The data used in this analysis was collected via
personal interviews and the study response rate at wave 7 was 61%.21 The baseline sample consisted of 12,099 members. This analysis uses data from the
core sample members who were recruited at either the first wave or at any of the
refreshment samples at waves 3, 4, 6 and 7.22 The effects of clustering and stratification in a complex sample design such as
ELSA were taken into account using wave-specific weights. The weights include a scaling
factor to make sure that the original sample and refreshment samples are as equally
proportional with respect to age as in the general population.21


Measures of health
ELSA records data on a range of physical and mental health conditions. Twenty five of
these variables were consistently recorded at each wave and are used to measure multiple
health conditions in this study (Table 1). This includes the most common conditions among the elderly (diabetes,
hypertension, stroke, cancer and depression), as found by a systematic literature review.23

Participants were asked whether they still had the condition diagnosed by a doctor that
they had reported previously and if not whether they could report a new condition. We have
grouped health data into three categories: individual morbidities, groups representing
body systems and functional limitations (Table 1). Adapting Verbrugge and Jette’s
disablement process framework,24 instances of impairment (dysfunction and abnormalities in body systems) and
disability (difficulty with daily activities) were included within the category of
‘functional limitations’ (restrictions in basic physical and mental actions).

Measure 1: Multimorbidity
We created a binary variable which identified people at each wave who had two or more
morbidities as listed in Table
1. The list includes a few symptoms such as hallucinations which do not represent
a condition but can be used as a proxy for schizophrenia or another condition (e.g.
alcohol dependency).25 In a similar way, emotional problems and mood swings are used as indicators of
either mild anxiety and depression or possibly manic depressive tendencies26 but the clinician has chosen not to use the more formal diagnostic label, for
whatever reason. The information on whether an individual has or has not got a chronic
disease was composed of the data fed forward from the previous wave of observation and
from the information on the newly reported cases of disease.

Measure 2: Complex multimorbidity
Following the definition of CMM by Harrison et al.,7 we identified individuals with three or more body systems affected by disease as
having CMM. Body systems were defined and represented by the chapters of the International
Classification of Diseases 10th Revision system (Table 1).

Measure 3: Multiple functional limitations
The third health outcome was based on the combination of general mobility variables,
activities of daily living (ADL) variables and data on symptoms of chronic conditions
(Table 1). ADL is used to
measure functional capacity and it concerns the abilities necessary for basic functioning,
as well as functions necessary for living in a community.27 Most studies have explored prevalence and effects of either single impairments and
functional limitations or their combinations in ADL or instrumental ADL, but we decided to
examine their combined burden by summing all of them up including the symptoms.
Difficulties with walking were captured with three distinct variables (having difficulty
walking 0.25 mile, walking 100 yards and walking across a room) which, if combined,
reflect the degree of severity. For example, a person who has got all three difficulties
is more functionally limited than a person with only one of them. The total number of
functional limitations per individual was summed up. Based on the exhaustive list of 29
limitations, the frequencies of MFLs were high, reflecting the older age of participants.
To identify the participants with the highest level of disability we decided to set a
cut-off point of 10 or more functional limitations within the same person.

Covariates
Age
Age was categorized into 5-year bands, from 50–54 up to 80–84 years of age. The age of
persons aged 85 and older was collapsed in one category 85+ due to small sample size.

Sex
Sex is an important determinant of health. Previous studies have shown that while women
in most countries have a longer life expectancy than men, they are more likely to be
affected by a number of chronic diseases.5,28,29


Socio-economic status
SES was measured using quintiles of net total household wealth. Household wealth embodies
access to financial resources accumulated during life and therefore reflects social status
at later life.30,31 The net household wealth is defined as the sum of savings, investments, physical
wealth and housing wealth after financial debt and mortgage debt have been subtracted. It
is based on 22 distinct components of wealth and debt.21 The wealth intervals in £s between 2002 and 2015 are presented in Online
Supplementary Material B, Table B.4. While the median value of households increased in
2002–2015 from £100,000 to £190,000, most change was due to the outlier values in the
poorest and the richest quintiles.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses of the study population included summary statistics to explore
general patterns. Data were weighted for non-response, stratification and clustering
effects. The variation in the size of the age groups decreased over time for age groups of
older people, but the pattern nevertheless justified the need for age standardization
between waves (Online Supplementary Material A). The prevalence was standardized to the
age distribution of the population at wave 1 in 2002, to allow for more robust comparison
of trends over time. Standardization also helps our results to remain representative of
national patterns improving their generalizability.

We have conducted repeated cross-sectional analyses of prevalence at a population level.
Prevalence estimates were stratified by age groups, sex and wealth quintiles, to observe
the distribution of outcomes by selected covariates. We then checked for consistency and
interaction effects of Time × SES and Age × SES by merging the waves of measurement into a
panel dataset. This allowed us to compare the estimates from cross-sectional analyses with
two multilevel logistic regression models, taking into account temporal correlation within
individuals. The results were plotted graphically using marginal effects at representative
values. All analyses were conducted in Stata version 13.

Results
General characteristics of the study population
The general characteristics of the studied population are shown in Table 2. The number of participants varied between
11,391 (2002/2003) and 8249 (2014/2015). The median age in 2002/2003 was 64 (interquartile
range (IQR) 56–73) and it increased to 67 years in 2014/2015 (IQR 61–75). The proportion
of the oldest old people, aged 85 or more, was between 5.2% in 2002/2003 and 5.7% in
2014/2015. The proportion of women was higher than the proportion of men (53.1%) on
average during the period 2002–2015.

Trends in the prevalence of our measures of MM
Figure 1 summarizes trends in the
prevalence of basic MM, CMM and MFLs. The prevalence of MM grew from 41.6% in 2002/2003 to
46.6% in 2014/2015. The prevalence of CMM grew from 12.2% in 2002/2003 to 21.1% in
2014/2015. This is a larger change relative to the baseline estimate than the growth of
basic MM. The prevalence of MFLs rose from 9.6% in 2002/2003 to 14.3% in 2014/2015 which
is larger than the growth of basic MM. Given our knowledge of the nature of functional
limitation as a consequence of MM,11,12 we would expect a larger relative change in this outcome than in either of the
multimorbidities. Hence, we examined developments for each component subgroup (general
mobility, ADLs and symptoms) separately and found similar flat trend for each of them
(Online Supplementary Material E, Figure 7).

multiple functional limitations for England, 2002–2015 (95% CIs). CI: confidence
interval.

Figure 2 shows the distribution
of the three health outcomes by sex over time. The comparison between sexes shows that
regardless of the measure of MM or specific time point, on average a higher proportion of
women have MM than men. The difference in the change of prevalence between sexes over time
was only marginal with the only exception being in CMM. The prevalence for males more than
doubled at the end of the followed period while the prevalence of CMM for females grew
only 1.6 times.

(b) females. CI: confidence interval.

Prevalence of the three measures of MM by age group
We next explored how the prevalence varied within age bands for each measure. The
prevalence of both types of MM and of MFLs at each time point increased with age (see
Online Supplementary Material B, Tables B.1–B.3). The difference in prevalence of MM
between the youngest (aged 50–54) and the oldest group (aged 85+) ranged between threefold
in wave 2012/2013 and fourfold in wave 2004/2005 (Online Supplementary Material B, Table
B.1). The majority of participants were multimorbid when and after reaching the 70–75 age
group. From 2012/2013, this threshold shifted to the 65–69 age band.

The difference in the prevalence of CMM between the youngest and the oldest group ranged
between 4.6 times in 2010/2011 and 8.8 times in wave 2004/2005 (Online Supplementary
Material B, Table B.2). The variation in prevalence levels by age is larger in the complex
than basic MM. The difference in the prevalence of 10+ functional limitations between the
youngest and the oldest group ranged between 3.9 times in wave 2010/2011 and 7.2 times in
2014/2015 (Online Supplementary Material B, Table B.3). Prevalence of both CMM and 10+
MFLs remained under 50% within each age group.

Stratification of prevalence by SES
Regardless of the outcome, clear differences between the socio-economic groups were
observed (Figure 3). Prevalence of
MM, CMM and MFLs was graded by each wealth quintile with people in the poorest quintile
having the highest prevalence and people in the wealthiest quintile having the lowest. The
measure of the MFLs captured the largest relative differences between the most and the
least affluent groups (5.9-fold in 2014/2015), followed by the measure of CMM (2.8-fold in
2014/2015). The relative difference was the smallest for basic MM (1.9-fold) in 2014/2015.
The interaction between time and household wealth was tested in a logistic marginal
effects model and the results agreed with the stratified distribution of the prevalence
(Online Supplementary Material C).

Figure 3. Age-standardized prevalence of (a) basic multimorbidity, (b) complex multimorbidity
and (c) 10+ multiple functional limitations by quintiles of household wealth for
England, 2002–2015 (95% CIs). CI: confidence interval.

We further stratified each age band by quintiles of household wealth to observe
differences in prevalence of our measures (Figure 4).To avoid data clutter, we report only
results for the observation in 2014/2015. We found the largest variation in the 50–54 age
group. The prevalence of basic MM in the poorest quintile was 4.1-times higher than in the
richest quintile in the youngest age group. People aged 50–54 years in the poorest
quintile had levels of MM equivalent to people 15–20 years older in the most affluent
quintile. The prevalence of CMM and MFLs in the poorest category was 18.7-times and
14-times higher than in the wealthiest category in the youngest age group. People aged
50–54 years in the poorest quintile had levels of MM equivalent to people 20 years older
(for CMM) and 30 years older (for MFLs) in the most affluent quintile.

multiple functional limitations by age band and wealth quintile for England, 2014/2015
(95% CIs). CI: confidence interval.

The patterns in Figure 4
indicated that the effect of age on the prevalence estimates varies by SES. The
interaction effect for the whole period 2002–2015 was further explored in a logistic
regression model. The marginal effects (see Online Supplementary Material D, Figure 6)
show changes in the probability of an outcome as the values of the household wealth
variable change between quintiles. The additional effect of change in wealth quintile on
the probability of having MM in 2014/2015 was the strongest in the lowest wealth quintile
up to the age of 80–84. An overall pattern for all quintiles represents a socio-economic
gradient up to the age of 75–80. For older age groups, the effects overlap and no pattern
is discernible any more. The pattern changes for people with MFLs. The graded differences
in effects between quintiles are more pronounced and they remain distinct even in the
oldest age category. This confirms the distribution for 2014/2015 identified in Figure 4.

Discussion
Key results
Our study found that the prevalence of basic MM, CMM and MFLs in the ageing population of
England increased between 2002/2003 and 2014/2015. We standardized our analysis to remove
differences in age structure over time but in absolute terms, this increase will be even
larger due to the ageing population. Also the addition of refreshment samples (age 50–53)
at waves 3, 4, 6 and 7 has potentially resulted in an underestimation of the prevalence.
The distribution of these health outcomes at population level was influenced by sex as
they were more common among women than among men. Age was another determinant of the
distribution. Our health outcomes were becoming more common in younger age groups during
the observed period. The age when majority of an age group became multimorbid shifted from
the 70–74 age group to the 65–69 age group (Online Supplementary Material B, Table B.1).
Out of the three measures, the prevalence of CMM had the steepest growth, followed by MFLs
and basic MM. Furthermore, the prevalence of MM, CMM and MFLs was socially stratified.
People with less household wealth had higher levels of multiple health problems than
people from the more affluent wealth quintiles. The disparity in wealth was larger for CMM
and functional limitations than for basic MM.

We also discovered that SES and age mutually interacted. The differences in the
prevalence of basic MM between the wealth quintiles were the largest in the youngest age
group and they narrowed down as people aged (Figure 4). The differences in the prevalence of CMM
and especially MFLs between the poorest and wealthiest quintile remained large for all age
groups (Figure 4).

The pattern of health inequality based on cross-sectional stratification analyses in
Figures 3 and 4 was confirmed after data were
reshaped into a panel design where time interacted with wealth (Online Supplementary
Material C, Figure 5) and age interacted with wealth (Online Supplementary Material D,
Figure 6).

Interpretation
The rising prevalence of MM consistent across three different conceptualizations between
2002/2003 and 2014/2015 supports projections of a growing trend.4 Prevalence in general is shaped by both the rate at which new cases are occurring
and the average duration of disease. Our analysis was a repeated cross-sectional and as
such it examined neither the incidence nor the duration of MM and cannot quantify their
relative contribution to the increased prevalence.

Household wealth, an indicator of SES, was negatively associated with MM and MFLs. This
is consistent with previous studies reporting socio-economic gradient in MM.15–20,32 Our study observed that the gap between the wealth quintiles was larger for
participants with CMM and the largest for people with 10 or more functional limitations.
Lack of household wealth was related to higher complexity of MM and corresponding
limitations and vice versa. This is consistent with the findings of a study examining
growth in functional limitations and socio-economic factors.33 It seems plausible that this gradient in complexity might be explained by problems
with the self-management of MM. Patients whose everyday lives are overwhelmed by acute
social problems are less able to manage the complex treatment burden and find adequate
social support.34 This would suggest that the true impact of inequalities is underestimated if MM is
defined as the presence of two or more conditions or, similarly, if the cut-off measure
for number of functional limitations is set too low.

Ageing with MM and functional limitation was differentiated by SES. We observed an excess
of multiple health problems in the youngest age cohort with lowest SES. People aged 50–54
years in the poorest quintile had levels of CMM comparable to those 20 years older in the
most affluent quintile and level of functional limitations comparable to those 30 years
older in the top wealth quintile. This suggests an earlier onset of MM, and especially of
CMM and MFLs, for people with lower SES. Earlier origins of basic MM in Scotland were
observed by Barnett et al.15 The differences in the prevalence between the wealth quintiles were the largest in
the youngest age group but they narrowed down as people aged. Similar levelling effects of
ageing on basic MM prevalence have been reported previously.15 The differences in the prevalence of CMM and especially MFLs between the poorest
and wealthiest quintile remained large for all age groups. This suggests that accumulated
financial resources at older age can act as a protective factor against increased disease
complexity. One pathway in which this accumulated financial resources may protect against
increased disease complexity is via financial advantage translating into an actual healthy
behaviour. For example, Link and Phelan postulated that individuals from higher social
class backgrounds are capable to use resources such as power, money, knowledge, prestige
or social contacts to either protect themselves from the health risks or compensate for
their existing disease burden.35


Limitations
Our exploratory study focused on the assessment of the burden of MM, CMM and MFLs at the
population level. Using a repeated cross-sectional design does not allow any explanatory
inferences to be drawn regarding individual trends or causal relationships between
covariates and outcome variables.

The estimates of prevalence might be underestimated as they are based on self-reported
information on health problems. A previous study found that prevalence based on
self-reports was lower than if data were obtained from medical examinations.36 A combination of data sources was suggested as the best way of providing the most
reliable results.6


This study could be expanded if we had shown an association between the two MM measures
and the measure of MFLs. Such an analysis might be interesting especially as both CMM and
MFLs represent problems affecting multiple body systems.

Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first study to examine trends in the
prevalence of MM as measured through three types of conceptualizations of MM. We uncovered
processes of clear polarization within the ageing population of England. Alongside stable
proportion of people who were free of any chronic disease and declining proportion of those
with one disease, we observed that the increase in complexity overtakes the rise in basic MM
and MFLs. Another axis of differentiation is by SES where the higher household wealth is
related to lower prevalence. At the same time, this process introduces health inequality
within age groups. CMM and MFLs are increasing faster and capture stronger inequality than
the measure of basic MM. Using different measures of MM can contribute to identify
population groups with higher healthcare needs and to a better allocation of healthcare
resources. Reporting the patterns of body systems affected by chronic conditions may help
healthcare planners identify services which should be co-located, for an optimal care of
these patients.37 The CMM measure would also allow identification of patients who may need help in
coordinating care between multiple healthcare providers.

Policies aiming to prevent and reduce the growth in MM should be approaching older
population as diverse and take into account the multiple polarizations we have described. It
would be meaningful to focus the preventive efforts to younger age groups where social
inequality appears to be more intertwined with chronic complexity and functional limitation
than in older age. The contribution of these younger cohorts as they age into the older
population, along with growing numbers of the very old, could significantly increase the
health and social care costs in future.
