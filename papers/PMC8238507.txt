Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in elderly adds substantially to socioeconomic burden necessitating early diagnosis. While recent studies in rodent models of AD have suggested diagnostic and therapeutic value for gamma rhythms in brain, the same has not been rigorously tested in humans. In this case-control study, we recruited a large population (N = 244; 106 females) of elderly (>49 years) subjects from the community, who viewed large gratings that induced strong gamma oscillations in their electroencephalogram (EEG). These subjects were classified as healthy (N = 227), mild cognitively impaired (MCI; N = 12), or AD (N = 5) based on clinical history and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. Surprisingly, stimulus-induced gamma rhythms, but not alpha or steady-state visually evoked responses, were significantly lower in MCI/AD subjects compared to their age- and gender-matched controls. This reduction was not due to differences in eye movements or baseline power. Our results suggest that gamma could be used as a potential screening tool for MCI/AD in humans.

Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most common forms of dementia, characterised by declining memory and thinking skills, and behavioural changes that worsen over time. It affects millions of people worldwide, mostly in older age, and yet early indicators of the disease are lacking. Most cases are only diagnosed once a person’s brain function becomes noticeably impaired, even though known biological changes underpin the disease. Detecting Alzheimer’s disease early could aid diagnosis and enable early intervention, while also improving the chances of finding treatments to halt or reverse the disease.

Currently, brain function is measured by performing cognitive tests, such as remembering a set of words, imaging the brain with MRIs or CT scans, and blood or spinal fluid tests. Many of these tests can be invasive and expensive, so researchers are exploring whether measuring oscillations in the brain’s electrical activity can be a non-invasive and chepaer way of testing brain function. Gamma oscillations are rhythmic signals, thought to be involved in attention and working memory. Animals used to study Alzheimer’s disease have shown some abnormalities in gamma oscillations, and studies of healthy humans have also observed a decline in the strength and frequency of these oscillations with age. These findings have spurred an interest in understanding the link between gamma oscillations and AD in humans.

To investigate this link, Murty et al. measured patterns of brain activity in elderly people chosen from the community using electrodes placed on their scalps (a technique called electroencephalography). These participants watched certain images previously shown to elicit gamma oscillations. Participants who were later diagnosed with early Alzheimer’s disease had weaker gamma oscillations than their cognitively healthy peers in the part of the brain that processes visual images.

These results build upon previous findings from animal research suggesting that gamma oscillations may be disrupted in early Alzheimer’s disease. The work by Murty et al. could lead the way to new ways of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease, where early indicators are urgently needed.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a predominant cause of dementia (decline in cognitive abilities) of old age and substantially contributes to the socioeconomic burden in the geriatric population, necessitating early diagnosis. Advances in our understanding of cellular pathology of AD in rodent models and its link to gamma rhythms in brain have spurred interest to investigate diagnostic and therapeutic potential of gamma rhythms in AD and other forms of dementia (Mably and Colgin, 2018; Palop and Mucke, 2016).

Gamma rhythms are narrow-band oscillations in brain’s electrical activity with center frequency occupying ~30–80 Hz frequency range (Gray et al., 1989). These are suggested to be generated from excitatory-inhibitory interactions of pyramidal cell-interneuron networks (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012) involving parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) interneurons (Cardin et al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009; Veit et al., 2017). These have been proposed to be involved in certain cognitive functions like feature binding (Gray et al., 1989), attention (Chalk et al., 2010; Fries et al., 2001; Gregoriou et al., 2009), and working memory (Pesaran et al., 2002).

Some studies have reported abnormalities in gamma linked to interneuron dysfunction in AD. For example, Verret et al., 2012 reported PV interneuron dysfunction in parietal cortex of AD patients and hAPP mice (models of AD). They found aberrant gamma activity in parietal cortex in such mice. Further, some recent studies have suggested therapeutic benefit of entraining brain oscillations in gamma range in rodent models of AD. For example, Iaccarino et al., 2016 suggested that visual stimulation using light flickering at 40 Hz entrained neural activity at 40 Hz and correlated with decrease in Aβ amyloid load in visual cortices of 5XFAD, APP/PS1 mice models of AD. Based on such reports in rodents in both visual and auditory modalities, some investigators have suggested a paradigm termed GENUS (gamma-entrainment of neural activity using sensory stimuli) and have claimed to show neuro-protective effects in rodent models of AD (Adaikkan et al., 2019; Martorell et al., 2019).

Recent studies in human EEG (Murty et al., 2020; Murty et al., 2018) and MEG (Pantazis et al., 2018) have reported existence of two gamma rhythms (slow: ~20–34 Hz and fast: ~36–66 Hz) in visual cortex, elicited by Cartesian gratings. Age-related decline in power and/or frequency of these stimulus-induced gamma rhythms has been shown in cognitively healthy subjects (Gaetz et al., 2012; Murty et al., 2020). However, abnormalities in such stimulus-induced visual narrow-band gamma rhythms in human patients of mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a preclinical stage of dementia [Albert et al., 2011; Petersen et al., 1999; Sosa et al., 2012]) or AD have not been demonstrated till date.

We addressed this question in the present double-blind case-control EEG study involving a large cohort of elderly subjects (N = 244; 106 females, all aged >49 years) recruited from urban communities in Bangalore, India. These were classified as healthy (N = 227; see Murty et al., 2020), or suffering from MCI (N = 12) or AD (N = 5) based on clinical history and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR; Hughes et al., 1982; Morris, 1993) scores. We studied narrow-band gamma rhythms induced by full-screen Cartesian gratings in all these subjects. We also examined steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) at 32 Hz in a subset of these subjects (seven MCI and two AD subjects). We monitored eyes using an infrared eye tracker to rule out differences in gamma power due to potential differences in eye position or microsaccade rate (Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008).

Results

We presented achromatic full-screen static sinusoidal grating stimuli that varied in spatial frequency (1, 2, and 4 cpd) and orientation (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°; Figure 1A) to a large cohort of elderly subjects (227 healthy, 12 MCI, and 5 AD subjects; see 'Materials and methods' for details of subject selection and classification). We first examined whether gamma power depended on orientation and spatial frequency. We have previously shown that gamma oscillations in EEG recorded from healthy young subjects have low orientation selectivity (Murty et al., 2018). Consistent with this, we found that stimulus-induced change in fast gamma power did not vary significantly across different orientations (Figure 1—figure supplement 1; two-way ANOVA with spatial frequency and orientation as factors; F(3,2723) = 0.87, p=0.46) in healthy subjects, with very low orientation selectivity (mean ± SEM: 0.02 ± 0.002; see 'Materials and methods' for details). Slow gamma varied with orientation (F(3,2723) = 6.4, p=0.0003); however, orientation selectivity calculated across the four orientations was small (mean ± SEM: 0.03 ± 0.002; see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for details). We therefore averaged all data across the four orientations.

Figure 1. Fixation task.

Every trial started with the onset of a fixation spot (0.1°) at the center of the screen on which the subjects had to maintain fixation. After an initial blank period of 1000 ms (gray screen), 2–3 stimuli were randomly shown for 800 ms. These consisted of sinusoidal luminance gratings presented full screen at full contrast. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was 700 ms. Each stimulus (of a particular combination of spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and orientation) was presented for a total of ~30–40 times according to the subjects’ comfort and willingness, and is referred to as a ‘stimulus repeat’ in this paper unless otherwise stated. (A) Gamma experiment: static gratings (temporal frequency = 0 Hz) were presented at three spatial frequencies (SFs): 1, 2, and 4 cycles per degree (cpd) and four orientations: 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°. This experiment lasted for ~25 min, with 1–2 short breaks (for 3–5 min) between blocks. (B) SSVEP experiment: gratings were randomly presented at a temporal frequency of 0 (static) or 16 cycles per second (cps). SF and orientation combination of gratings was fixed across the experiment. This was the combination that showed high change in slow and fast gamma power for each subject during preliminary analysis performed during the session. This experiment followed Gamma experiment during the same session and lasted for ~5 min completed in one block.

Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Slow and fast gamma for different orientations and spatial frequencies in healthy subjects.

(A) Stimulus-induced change in slow (top row) and fast (bottom row) gamma power for three spatial frequencies (1, 2, and 4 cpd) and four orientations (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°). Gray dots represent data for each of the 227 healthy subjects. SEM is indicated as black vertical lines on the bars. Because of a large variability in gamma power across subjects, the SEMs are barely visible. Therefore, for clarity, we have plotted these means and SEM (error bars) separately in the insets. We statistically quantified differences in these means across orientations using one-way ANOVA at each spatial frequency. We found that these were not significant for any gamma at any spatial frequency, except for slow gamma at 2 cpd (for slow gamma, 1/2/4 cpd: F(3,904) = 0.63/5.81/1.37, p=0.59/0.0006/0.25; for fast gamma, 1/2/4 cpd: F(3,904) = 0.27/0.96/0.83, p=0.84/0.41/0.48). Specifically, for 2 cpd, change in slow gamma power was 0.92 ± 0.06, 1.31 ± 0.07, 1.01 ± 0.08, and 1.21 ± 0.08 dB (mean ± SEM) for 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° orientations, respectively, as seen in the insets. (B) Scatter plots showing orientation selectivity for slow gamma (on ordinate) and fast gamma (on abscissa) for 227 healthy subjects at 1, 2, and 4 cpd (top, middle, and bottom rows). Mean ± SEM orientation selectivity for slow and fast gamma are mentioned in the plots in pink and orange, respectively. Mean orientation selectivity is also indicated as a red cross in the plots.

As reported previously, gamma power varied across spatial frequencies as well (same two-way ANOVA as above; slow/fast gamma: F(2,2723) = 31.1/50.7, p=4.6×10−14/2.4×10−22). In particular, we found that the difference in gamma between cases and controls was more prominent at spatial frequencies of 2 and 4 cpd, so we used the data for these two spatial frequencies for main analysis. The 1 cpd condition, as well as the power averaged across all three spatial frequencies, gave similar, albeit slightly weaker, results (as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3).

Because the sample sizes were severely unbalanced between cases and controls, for each case subject, we selected controls who were age- (±1 year) and gender-matched and averaged their spectral data. All results shown here are based on pairwise comparison between cases and their averaged controls. Non-pairwise comparison (e.g., between 12 MCI and their 74 age- and gender-matched controls) yielded similar results.

Change in gamma power, but not alpha suppression, was reduced in case group compared to control group

First, we examined how the two gamma rhythms differed in MCI subjects as compared to their healthy age- and gender-matched controls. We averaged spectral data for all analyzable bipolar electrodes (as described in Murty et al., 2020) from nine occipital and parieto-occipital pairs (marked in black enclosures in Figure 2D; see EEG data analysis subsection in 'Materials and methods') for each subject. We compared the change in power spectral densities (PSDs) for each MCI with the mean change in power of their corresponding age- and gender-matched controls. Figure 2A shows the median stimulus-induced change in PSDs for 12 MCIs (yellow) and their controls (dark orange; light shaded regions show ± SD of median after bootstrapping for 10,000 iterations). While both slow and fast gamma ‘bumps’ were conspicuously visible for MCI as well as control groups, power in both slow gamma (20–34 Hz) and fast gamma (36–66 Hz) ranges (but not alpha, 8–12 Hz range) was significantly lower in the MCI group compared to the control group (Kruskal-Wallis [K-W] test, significance as shown in Figure 2A). This could also be seen in the median time-frequency change in power spectrograms (baseline: −500–0 ms of stimulus onset) for cases and controls in Figure 2B. Change in band-limited power was significantly less for both gamma bands in the MCI group compared to the control group (Figure 2C; slow gamma: χ2(23) = 4.09, p=0.043; fast gamma: K-W test, χ2(23) = 5.61, p=0.018). However, alpha power was not significantly different (χ2(23) = 0.33, p=0.56). Results were similar when we combined both gamma bands to a single band (20–66 Hz; χ2(23) = 5.08, p=0.024) or used the ‘traditional’ gamma band (30–80 Hz; χ2(23) = 5.34, p=0.021). Figure 2—figure supplement 1 shows the time-frequency change in power spectra of individual MCI subjects and the mean of their controls, sorted by increasing gamma power in the MCI subjects. Although there was substantial variability across subjects (also observed in Figure 2C), only 3/12 MCIs showed higher slow gamma power and only 2/12 MCIs showed higher fast gamma than controls.

Black asterisks represent significance of differences in medians (K-W test, p<0.05, not Bonferroni-corrected). (D) Average scalp maps of 112 bipolar electrodes (disks) for cases (bottom row) and controls (top row) for alpha (left), slow gamma (middle), and fast gamma (right).

Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Time-frequency change in power spectrograms for MCI compared to their corresponding controls.

Change in power spectrograms for individual MCIs plotted in right column and mean spectrograms across their respective healthy controls in left column. The spectrograms are arranged by the differences in total gamma power (slow + fast, change from baseline in dB) for each MCI case and their respective age- and gender-matched controls, highest difference plotted first. Age, gender, labels of cases, and number of matched controls (N) are noted on spectrograms. White horizontal lines represent alpha (dotted), slow gamma (solid), and fast gamma (dashed) bands. Out of 12 MCI cases, only 3 (M9, M11-12) had higher slow gamma and 2 (M10, M12) had higher fast gamma than their controls. For the rest, MCI subjects had lower slow and fast gamma power than the median power for their healthy controls.

Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Alpha, slow, and fast gamma in MCI subjects and fewer controls.

Same format as in Figure 2, but only one control per MCI has been considered for analysis. Both slow and fast gamma were significantly reduced (slow gamma: K-W test, χ2(23) = 4.09, p=0.043; fast gamma: χ2(23) = 4.09, p=0.043), but not alpha (χ2(23) = 1.33, p=0.24). Similar results were obtained for N = 4 controls per case (the minimum number of controls that we had per case; slow gamma: K-W test, χ2(23) = 3.86, p=0.05; fast gamma: χ2(23) = 6.17, p=0.013; alpha: χ2(23) = 0.4, p=0.52; data not shown).

Figure 2—figure supplement 3. Alpha, slow, and fast gamma in MCI subjects and controls across different spatial frequencies.

Top row: Stimulus-induced change in PSDs for different spatial frequencies (mentioned above the top row, cpd: cycles per degree). Bottom row: Change in power in alpha, slow gamma, and fast gamma bands. Same format as in Figure 2A and C. PSDs and change in power values were calculated separately for each of the 12 spatial frequency/orientation combinations and were averaged across all four orientations for each spatial frequency. For rightmost column (1–4 cpd), PSDs and change in power values for each spatial frequency (averaged across orientations) were averaged. Although the PSDs and change in slow/fast gamma power were lower in MCIs compared to controls, the effect was more prominent for 2 and 4 cpd conditions (K-W test; values at different frequencies are indicated below PSDs; for bar plots: χ2(23) = 1.47/0.01/0.48, p=0.23/0.91/0.49 for alpha, χ2(23) = 1.08/4.33/5.08, p=0.30/0.037/0.024 for slow gamma, and χ2(23) = 0.96/5.89/5.61, p=0.33/0.015/0.018 for fast gamma, for 1/2/4 cpd, respectively; for 1–4 cpd condition, χ2(23) = 1.08, p=0.30 for alpha, χ2(23) = 3, p=0.08 for slow gamma, and χ2(23) = 5.89, p=0.015 for fast gamma).

Figure 2—figure supplement 4. Evoked potentials in MCIs and healthy controls.

(A) Solid traces indicate median evoked potentials across 12 MCIs (yellow) and median of mean traces for 12 sets of healthy controls (dark orange). Shaded regions indicate ± SD from medians after bootstrapping over 10,000 iterations. Vertical lines represent 0–250 ms of stimulus onset. P1, N1, and P2 peaks are represented in colored ovals (violet, pink, and orange, respectively). We did not find any significant difference in the evoked potentials at any time point (K-W test, p>0.05 at all time points). (B) Median amplitudes of root mean square (RMS) values in 0–250 ms, P1, N1, and P2 peaks for MCIs (yellow) and controls (dark orange). Data of individual MCI and mean for their respective controls are represented as gray circles. Error bars indicate ± SD from medians after bootstrapping over 10,000 iterations. None of these medians were different in the MCI and control groups (K-W test, RMS: χ2(23) = 0.12, p=0.79; P1: χ2(23) = 0.03, p=0.86; N1: χ2(23) = 1.08, p=0.30; P2: χ2(23) = 1.2, p=0.27).

We note that we have used very stringent conditions for computation of gamma power, similar to our previous work (Murty et al., 2020; Murty et al., 2018). For example, for all subjects, we used the same set of electrodes over which gamma was computed, as well as same time and frequency ranges. Further, we computed the total power within a band by simply summing the absolute power values within the band separately in baseline and stimulus periods and then taking a ratio. This estimate has larger contribution from lower frequencies in the band because of the power-law distribution of PSDs in baseline/stimulus periods. Consequently, if the traces are overlapping at lower frequencies within the band and diverge at higher frequencies, which was the case in the slow gamma range, the total change in power in the band may not be significantly different. Therefore, these results could be further improved by customizing the low frequency limit of the gamma band for each subject, as well as choosing only electrodes that show stronger gamma. For example, taking slow and fast gamma ranges as 26–34 Hz and 44–56 Hz improved the p-values (slow gamma: χ2(23) = 7.69, p=0.005; fast gamma: χ2(23) = 8.34, p=0.004). Although we have refrained from such customization here because we wanted to study the efficacy of a simple and subject-independent computational procedure, such data-driven subject specific optimization holds promise for improving the efficacy of a gamma-based biomarker.

Figure 2D shows the median scalp maps (see EEG data analysis subsection in 'Materials and methods') of change in band-limited power across 112 bipolar electrode pairs (shown as discs) for alpha, slow, and fast gamma bands. Stimulus-induced change in power across all three bands was most prominent in the nine electrode pairs as above. However, this change in power was less in the MCI group compared to the control group in slow and fast gamma bands (but not alpha band) as noted in Figure 2C.

For two MCI subjects (M1 and M4 as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1), slow gamma power was less than 0 dB. This could be because visual stimuli typically suppress power at low frequencies (<30 Hz), and if the visual stimulus does not induce sufficiently strong slow-gamma rhythm, there is an overall reduction in power between 20 and 35 Hz. However, our results remained consistent even when these two MCI subjects were removed from analysis (χ2(19) = 4.81, p=0.028, for slow gamma between 26 and 34 Hz). Similarly, our results did not change when we removed one MCI subject (subject M5) who had negative fast gamma power (χ2(21) = 4.56, p=0.032).

Our study had many control subjects for each case subject (range 4–19). To rule out the possibility that our results were influenced by this imbalance, we first ordered the control subjects based on the difference in experiment date from the case subject and then chose only the first N control subjects. We tried different values of N and found that our results remained consistent in all cases, with less slow and fast gamma power in cases vs controls. For example, Figure 2—figure supplement 2 shows the results for N = 1 (a single control for each case).

Although the error bars shown in Figure 2C appear smaller for controls than cases, that is only because each data point for the control group is already an average across many subjects. When a single control subject was used per case (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), the error bars were comparable (standard error of the medians: 0.33, 0.20, and 0.34 for controls vs 0.28, 0.08, and 0.36 for cases, for slow gamma, fast gamma, and alpha, respectively). Similarly, if we pooled all the control subjects in one group without averaging (N = 74 controls vs 12 MCI subjects), the standard deviations of slow gamma, fast gamma, and alpha power were 0.94, 0.72, and 0.67 for controls and 0.79, 0.36, and 1.00 for cases. Therefore, the variability in power was comparable in the two groups.

Figure 2—figure supplement 3 shows the results for individual spatial frequencies as well as after pooling all three spatial frequencies. MCI subjects had less slow and fast gamma than controls at all spatial frequencies, although the effect was stronger at spatial frequencies of 2 and 4 cpd.

We also tested whether the event-related potentials (ERPs) varied across MCIs and healthy controls. Consistent with literature, we noticed three prominent peaks in the ERPs for these subjects: P1, N1, and P2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). The ERPs were not different between MCIs and controls (Figure 2—figure supplement 4, panel A). Specifically, we did not find any significant difference between P1/N1/P2 peak amplitude (Figure 2—figure supplement 4, panel B). These analyses indicate that the differences that we observed for MCIs and controls were limited only to slow and fast gamma power.

Figure 3 shows the same results for the five AD subjects in our cohort. We interpret these results with caution, since the number of subjects is small (although the study would have benefitted from a larger sample size for both MCI and AD categories, it was not possible to increase the sample size due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Nonetheless, we observed a strong reduction in the slow and fast gamma bands (Figure 3A and B), which was significant for both slow gamma (χ2(9) = 4.81 p=0.028) and fast gamma (χ2(9) = 3.94, p=0.047), but not alpha (χ2(9) = 0.01, p=0.92). Data from individual AD subjects and their controls are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. All five AD subjects had less slow gamma power, and only one AD subject (A5) had more fast gamma power relative to the controls. Further, similar to MCI subjects, AD subjects had less slow and fast gamma than controls at all spatial frequencies, although the effect was stronger at spatial frequencies of 2 and 4 cpd (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).

Same as in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, but for five AD subjects and their respective controls. Similar to MCI subjects, changes in PSDs and slow/fast gamma power were lower in ADs compared to controls. This effect was more prominent for 2 and 4 cpd conditions (K-W test; χ2(9) = 0.27/0.27/0.1, p=0.60/0.60/0.75 for alpha, χ2(9) = 3.94/3.94/4.81, p=0.047/0.047/0.028 slow gamma, and χ2(9) = 0.88/1.84/3.94, p=0.35/0.17/0.047 for fast gamma, for 1/2/4 cpd, respectively; for 1–4 cpd condition, χ2(9) = 0.27, p=0.60 for alpha, χ2(9) = 4.81, p=0.028 for slow gamma, and χ2(9) = 3.15, p=0.076 for fast gamma, respectively).

Figure 3—figure supplement 3. Alpha, slow, and fast gamma in all cases (MCIs and ADs) and controls.

Same format as in Figure 2, but for 12 MCI + 5 AD subjects and their respective controls.

Because four out of five AD subjects had only mild AD (CDR = 1), we also tested the results after combining the MCI and AD data sets (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). While slow gamma (χ2(33) = 9.51, p=0.002) and fast gamma (χ2(33) = 8.88, p=0.003) power were strongly reduced in cases vs controls, there was no difference in alpha power (χ2(33) = 0.25, p=0.61) or frequencies higher than ~65 Hz.

We further tested the dependence of power in gamma/alpha bands on CDR score using a linear regression model (see Regression analysis section in 'Materials and methods') while accounting for age and gender. In the matched condition in which data from all the age- and gender-matched control subjects for each case were averaged (yielding 17 cases and 17 controls), the coefficient for CDR was significantly negative for both gamma bands (βCDR = –0.57/–0.25, p=0.0017/0.0063 for slow/fast gamma). Results were similar for the unmatched condition, in which all the controls were considered separately (112 healthy, 12 MCI, and 6 AD subjects), albeit the CDR slope (βCDR) was significantly negative only for slow gamma (βCDR = –0.62/–0.29, p=0.0071/0.0702 for slow/fast gamma). On the other hand, similar to the results in previous analyses, alpha power did not depend on CDR (βCDR = –0.30/–0.30, p=0.14/0.21 for matched/unmatched conditions).

We have previously shown that gamma power decreases with age in healthy elderly, and females have more gamma than males (Murty et al., 2020). Consistent with these results, we found that coefficient for age was significantly negative (βAGE = –0.018/–0.0094, p=0.014/0.06 for slow/fast gamma), while coefficient for gender was significantly positive (βGENDER = 0.33/0.35, p=0.0070/3.15 × 10−5 for slow/fast gamma) when the regression analysis was performed on the full set of healthy subjects (N = 227). However, when the regression analysis was performed with cases and controls as described above, the coefficients were not significant (matched: βAGE = 0.0042/4.13 × 10−5, p=0.73/0.99 and βGENDER = –0.036/0.11, p=0.87/0.36 for slow/fast gamma; unmatched: βAGE = –0.0071/–0.0009, p=0.51/0.91 and βGENDER = 0.17/0.19, p=0.30/0.10 for slow/fast gamma). This also suggests that CDR is a stronger predictor of gamma power than age or gender.

These results suggest that the alternate hypothesis (gamma power in controls was greater than cases) was more likely than the null hypothesis (controls and cases had comparable gamma power). We quantified this by estimating the Bayes factor (BF), which is the ratio of the marginal likelihood of the alternate hypothesis and the null hypotheses, given the data that we observed (see 'Materials and methods for details). For the MCI group (N = 12), BF computed using single-tailed paired t-test was ~1.89 for both slow and fast gamma. However, as before, choosing a more ‘sensitive’ range for slow gamma (26–34 Hz) and fast gamma (44–56 Hz) improved the BF to 3.34 and 4.60, respectively, suggesting substantial evidence for the alternate hypothesis over the null hypothesis. For the AD group (N = 5), BF was 2.85 for slow gamma and 1.83 for fast gamma, suggesting weak evidence, which did not improve substantially when more sensitive ranges were used. However, when both MCI and AD groups were combined, BF increased to 13.70 for slow gamma (26–34 Hz) and 8.60 for fast gamma (44–56 Hz), further strengthening the evidence in favor of alternate hypothesis. On the other hand, evidence for alpha band power was in favor of the null hypothesis (BF was 0.088 when only MCIs were considered, 0.29 for ADs, and 0.077 when both MCI and AD subjects were considered).

Difference in gamma power was not due to differences in eye position or movement

Previous studies have correlated increases in gamma power with occurrence of small involuntary eye movements called microsaccades (Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008). These have been described in previous literature using plots called ‘main sequence,’ which show peak velocity on ordinate and maximum velocity on abscissa on a log-log scale. These plots reveal the ballistic nature of microsaccades, that is, the initial velocity and maximum displacement of the eye in the visual field are correlated during microsaccadic movements (Engbert, 2006). We compared eye data between MCI/AD subjects and their respective controls and found comparable eye positions and microsaccade profiles (Figure 4A), similar main sequence (Figure 4B), and similar pupillary reactivity (Figure 4C) to stimulus presentation (measured as coefficient of variation of pupil diameter across time; see Murty et al., 2020). Further, the trends described in Figures 2 and 3 did not change qualitatively when we reanalyzed the data after removing stimulus repeats containing microsaccades (see 'Materials and methods') from analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), although these did not reach significance due to lesser number of trials (~45% of original analysis) and fewer subjects compared to the original analysis (see figure legend for details). Similarly, the trends held true when we reanalyzed only those repeats that had at least one microsaccade (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). These results indicate that the trends described in Figure 2 are independent of the presence or absence of microsaccades.

Average microsaccade rate (median ± SD of median of 10,000 bootstrapped samples) across all subjects for each group is also indicated at the bottom of the panels. MCI/AD cases had similar microsaccade rates (also seen in panel A) and main sequence plots compared to their healthy controls. (C) Bar plots showing coefficient of variation of pupil diameter (reactivity of pupil to stimulus presentation; see Murty et al., 2020) for 11 MCI (left), 4 AD (right), and their corresponding healthy controls. Data for individual MCIs and average across respective controls is represented by gray circles. Height of bars indicate medians and error bars indicate ± SD of median of 10,000 bootstrapped samples. We did not find any significant difference between the MCI/AD and control groups in pupil reactivity (K-W test, MCI vs controls: χ2(21) = 3.76, p=0.052; AD vs controls: χ2(7) = 0.75, p=0.39).

Top row: Stimulus-induced change in power spectral densities (PSDs) (top row) for MCI vs controls (left column) AD vs controls (right column). Same as in Figure 2A, but trials containing microsaccades (~55% of all trials) during the analysis period (−500 to 750 ms of stimulus onset) have been discarded from analysis. Bottom row: Change in power in alpha, slow gamma, and fast gamma bands. Left column: MCI vs controls, right column: AD vs controls. Same format as in Figure 2C. Although the differences in MCI and AD groups (compared to controls) computed over the fixed ranges were not significant (K-W test; for MCIs: χ2(21) = 2.81/3.27/1.82, p=0.09/0.07/0.18 for alpha/slow/fast gamma, respectively; for AD: χ2(7) = 0/3/1.33, p=1/0.08/0.25 for alpha/slow/fast gamma, respectively), the delta PSD curves for cases were generally below the controls in the gamma range, and results were significant for the MCI group when we chose a single gamma band between 20 and 66 Hz (χ2(21) = 4.02, p=0.045).

Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Spectral analyses for trials containing microsaccades.

Top row: Stimulus-induced change in PSDs (top row) for MCI vs controls (left column) and AD vs controls (right column). Same as in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, but only trials that contained microsaccades during the analysis period (−500 to 750 ms of stimulus onset) have been analyzed. Bottom row: Change in power in alpha, slow gamma, and fast gamma bands. Left column: MCI vs controls, right column: AD vs controls. Same format as in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. As before, although the differences in MCI and AD groups (compared to controls) were not significant for fixed ranges (K-W test; for MCIs: χ2(21) = 2/0.91/2.59, p=0.16/0.34/0.18 for alpha/slow/fast gamma, respectively; for AD: χ2(7) = 0.75/3/3, p=0.39/0.08/0.08 for alpha/slow/fast gamma, respectively), the delta PSD curves for cases were generally below the controls over most of the gamma range, and choosing the more sensitive slow gamma range between 26 and 34 Hz yielded a significance difference for the MCI group (χ2(21) = 5.75, p=0.016).

Difference in gamma power was not due to differences in baseline power

We also tested if the trends described in Figures 2 and 3 were seen for absolute band-limited power in the baseline condition. The cases (MCIs or ADs) and their respective controls had comparable PSDs (Figure 5) and slopes of PSDs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) in the baseline condition. Further, baseline power in alpha, slow gamma, and fast gamma frequency ranges did not differ significantly between cases and controls (K-W test; for MCIs: χ2(23) = 0.48/0/0, p=0.49/0.95/1 for alpha/slow/fast gamma, respectively; for AD: χ2(9) = 0.27/0.53/0.27, p=0.60/0.46/0.60 for alpha/slow/fast gamma, respectively). Thus, we concluded that the trends described in Figures 2 and 3 were specific to stimulus-induced change in slow/fast gamma power and did not depend on baseline absolute power or slopes of PSDs.

Left column: Baseline PSDs (top row) and bar plots (bottom row) showing baseline absolute power (calculated in −500–0 ms of stimulus onset) for each of the 12 MCIs and corresponding healthy controls in alpha, slow gamma, and fast gamma bands. Same format as in Figure 2A and C. Data for individual MCIs and averages of corresponding control subjects are shown in gray circles. Corresponding analyses for five AD subjects are shown in right column. None of the differences in MCI and AD groups (compared to controls) were significant (see Results section).

Same format as in Figure 5 (bottom row). None of the differences in MCI and AD groups (compared to controls) were significant (K-W test; for MCIs: χ2(23) = 0.21/0.56/0.01, p=0.64/0.45/0.91 for alpha/slow/fast gamma, respectively; for AD: χ2(9) = 0.27/0.53/3.15, p=0.60/0.46/0.07 for alpha/slow/fast gamma, respectively).

SSVEP power at 32 Hz was comparable in case and control groups

We next tested whether power of SSVEPs in gamma range also decreased in the MCI group as compared to the control group. We tested for SSVEPs at 32 Hz by presenting full-screen gratings that phase-reversed at 16 Hz (as described in Figure 1B). Ten of the 12 MCIs participated in this study, out of which data of only seven could be analyzed (data from three MCIs were discarded due to noise, see 'Materials and methods' for details). Figure 6A and B show median change in power spectral density plots (in 250–750 ms window of stimulus onset) and change in power time-frequency spectrograms (from a baseline period of −500–0 ms of stimulus onset) for these seven MCIs and their respective age- and gender-matched controls (as done for analyses in Figure 2A and B). Figure 6C and D show bar plots and scalp maps for 112 bipolar electrodes for change in SSVEP power at 32 Hz (during 250–750 ms of stimulus onset from a baseline of −500–0 ms, same as in Figure 2C and D) for control and MCI groups, respectively. We did not observe any reduction in SSVEP power at 32 Hz in the MCI group as compared to the control group (K-W Test, significance at each frequency of the change in power spectra is shown in Figure 6A; significance at 32 Hz: χ2(13) = 0.04, p=0.85). For comparison, we reanalyzed data for slow and fast gamma power for the Gamma experiment (as in Figure 2) with the same set of seven MCI subjects and their respective controls. MCIs had less slow and fast gamma power compared to controls as seen in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (same format as Figures 2 and 3), although these trends did not reach significance due to small sample size (K-W test, χ2(13) = 0.49/2.56, p=0.48/0.11 for slow/fast gamma, respectively). As before, choosing the more sensitive slow-gamma frequency range between 26 and 34 Hz yielded a significant difference between the two groups (K-W test, χ2(13) = 3.93, p=0.047). Alpha followed a similar insignificant trend as in Figure 2 (χ2(13) = 0, p=0.949). Further, adding the two AD subjects yielded significant differences in both slow and fast gamma power (K-W test, slow gamma between 26 and 34 Hz in Gamma experiment: χ2(17) = 4.31, p=0.038; fast gamma: χ2(17) = 4.69, p=0.03), but not for SSVEP power (for change in power at 32 Hz in SSVEP experiment: χ2(17) = 0.05, p=0.82).

For each MCI, average response of their respective controls is considered. Shaded areas in panels A and D represent error bars (standard deviation of mean calculated by bootstrapping over 10,000 iterations). Vertical lines in (D) represent 0–250 ms of stimulus onset. The changes in spectra were not different between MCI and controls as observed in Figure 6. Further, difference in the change in SSVEP power at 32 Hz between MCIs and controls was insignificant (K-W test, χ2(13) = 0.1, p=0.75). (E) Left panel: Bar plots showing median root mean square (RMS) amplitude and median peak amplitude of stimulus-onset response (0–250 ms of stimulus onset) calculated from trial-averaged time-courses for seven MCIs (yellow) and their respective controls (dark orange). Right panel: Bar plot showing peak time of stimulus-onset response. Data for individual MCIs and average for individual set of controls are shown in gray circles. Error bars represent standard deviation of medians calculated by bootstrapping over 10,000 iterations. None of these measures were significantly different for MCIs and controls (K-W test, χ2(13) = 0.33/0.92/1.48, p=0.56/0.34/0.22 for RMS-amplitude/peak-amplitude/peak time, respectively).

Trends for SSVEPs were not different when we performed time-frequency analysis on trial-averaged time-amplitude waveforms for each subject (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–C), instead for averaging time-frequency spectra of individual repeats for each subject, as done above for Gamma and SSVEP analyses. Further, stimulus onset-related responses (0–250 ms) were comparable between MCIs and their respective controls (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D). The RMS amplitude, peak amplitude, and time of the peak of the stimulus-onset response also did not differ among MCI subjects and their respective controls (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D–E). To conclude, change in SSVEP power at 32 Hz for cases was comparable to that of their controls, like alpha but unlike slow and fast gamma oscillations.

Discussion

Stimulus-induced change in power of both narrow-band slow and fast gamma oscillations reduced in elderly subjects with MCI and AD compared to their age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We removed or ruled out possible biases due to peripheral ocular factors or overall baseline noise of the PSDs to further strengthen the results. In contrast to gamma, we did not find any significant reduction in stimulus-induced alpha suppression, ERP, or SSVEP at 32 Hz in cases.

Previous studies have suggested abnormalities in spontaneous and evoked activity in gamma band in various disorders. Some studies have also explored abnormalities in other oscillatory bands such as alpha as well as functional connectivity across brain regions in such disorders. Examples include autism (An et al., 2018; Uhlhaas and Singer, 2007), schizophrenia (Hirano et al., 2015; Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010), and AD and other dementias (Herrmann and Demiralp, 2005; Jeong, 2004; Pievani et al., 2011). However, this is the first study to our knowledge that found abnormalities in visual narrow-band gamma oscillations elicited by Cartesian gratings in human EEG in MCI and AD.

Previously, van Deursen et al., 2008 examined neural activity in gamma frequency range and found that gamma activity increased in subjects with MCI/AD, as opposed to their initially proposed hypothesis. Our findings are different from theirs, probably due to the differences in task settings: we had tested for visual gamma rhythms induced by gratings, whereas they had tested for resting-state gamma as well as gamma activity for multiple-colored objects randomly moving on a computer screen (taken from screensavers). Whether our results hold true for drifting (moving) and chromatic gratings remains to be tested in future studies.

Potential of gamma rhythms as electrophysiological markers for MCI

Our sample is a representative of urban population in India as we adopted community-based sampling instead of hospital-based sampling. Importantly, out of the 257 subjects that we collected data from (247 used for analysis plus 10 subjects whose data was noisy and thus rejected, see 'Materials and methods'), there were 13 MCIs (~5%) and 6 AD subjects (2.3%). These figures match closely to the previously reported prevalence of MCI and AD in India (Kalaria et al., 2008; Mathuranath et al., 2012; Sosa et al., 2012). Within the recruited sample, most cases (~70%) had MCI, a condition that is conceptualized as intermediate stage between normal aging and AD. Criteria used to diagnose MCI are not strong and hence there is a need for a valid biomarker. Our study highlights the potential use of gamma oscillations in EEG in that direction.

Moreover, we had limited our analyses to sensor (electrode) level instead of reconstructing the neural sources and performing analyses at that level. This has allowed us to present a screening technique that is easy to replicate in a clinical setting. Furthermore, as our metrics were derived directly from neural activity, these could serve as a more objective assessment of the clinical status of the individual. Future studies should examine if different other stimulus paradigms like annular gratings (Muthukumaraswamy and Singh, 2013) and drifting gratings (Orekhova et al., 2015) could add to the robust evidence that is presented in this study.

Possible correlations of gamma power with neuroanatomy/physiology in AD

Gamma rhythms are generated by excitatory-inhibitory interactions in the brain (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012). These interactions could be influenced by many structural factors (Buzsáki et al., 2013) that could get abnormal in AD (such as cortical thinning and atrophy; see Dickerson et al., 2009; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011). However, how such structural derailments influence gamma recorded over scalp is unknown. A few studies in MEG had reported significant positive correlations between gamma frequency and cortical thickness as well as volume of cuneus (Gaetz et al., 2012) and thickness of pericalcarine area (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2010). However, such results could not be replicated in later studies (Cousijn et al., 2014) and have been shown to be confounded by age (Robson et al., 2015). Age is as a common factor that influences both macroscopic structure (Lemaitre et al., 2012; Salat et al., 2004; van Pelt et al., 2018) as well as gamma power and frequency (Murty et al., 2020).

Our main aim in this study was to examine the potential of gamma as a biomarker. However, as structural changes in AD brain are more evident and drastic compared to cognitively healthy aging (Dickerson et al., 2009; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011), future studies should examine correlations of gamma power/frequency and macroscopic structure such as cortical thickness in healthy/MCI/AD subjects while controlling for age. Moreover, as gamma rhythms have been correlated with many higher level cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, etc. (see Introduction), attempts must be made to extend and validate these findings in clinical populations, such as AD.

Comparison of SSVEP trends with findings in previous studies

Some investigators have suggested neuroprotective effects of entraining neural oscillations using flickering light/sound at 40 Hz (analogous to our SSVEP paradigm) in rodent models of AD (Adaikkan et al., 2019; Martorell et al., 2019; Thomson, 2018). Although we did not find any significant trend for SSVEP at 32 Hz in cases compared to controls (unlike our observations with narrow-band gamma), we cannot directly compare the results from abovementioned studies with our study for several reasons. First, the frequency of entrainment was different (40 Hz vs 32 Hz). Second, the model organism was different (human vs rodent). Finally, we did not measure any cognitive or pathological outcome of the visual stimulation. Indeed, while the previous studies have focused on therapeutic aspect of flicking stimulation, we only studied its potential for diagnosis. It is possible that entrainment of neural oscillations to visual stimulation in gamma frequency range gets deranged only in advanced stages of AD (as in the rodent models of Iaccarino et al., 2016). It may thus have therapeutic benefit but may not reflect as abnormal on testing early on (as in our case). Further, as discussed in the Methods, SSVEP study was always done at the end of the experiment in our study and the total number of stimulus repeats were much less than the gamma study. Nonetheless, the differences in trends for gratings and SSVEP evoked gamma presented in this study suggest that these two phenomena might be sub-served by different, yet unknown mechanisms. These differences have to be borne in mind while designing screening/therapeutic tools for MCI and AD.

Conclusions

Stimulus-induced change in visual narrow-band gamma power has the potential to be a simple, low-cost, easy to replicate, and objective biomarker for screening of MCI and AD. How this gamma-based biomarker compares against other methods used in diagnosis (MRI, PET, cognitive tests, etc.), whether addition of this biomarker to other standard methods improves the overall diagnosis, and the specificity of this biomarker for AD compared to other causes of dementia remain open questions that will require further research.

Subjects

We recruited 257 elderly subjects (109 females) aged 50–92 years from the Tata Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA) cohort from urban communities in Bangalore between July 2016 and July 2019. They were clinically diagnosed by psychiatrists (authors BN/AML) and/or a neurologist (author MJ) as cognitively healthy (N = 236) or suffering from MCI (N = 15) or AD (N = 6) through clinical history and a semi-structured clinical interview (Clinical Dementia Rating; see Table 1). Five out of the six AD subjects were directly referred to the study by the neurologist. Diagnosis of all MCI/AD subjects was further reviewed by a panel of four experts for consensus (see Appendix; criteria used by the panel are given in Tables 1–3 in Supplementary file 1), who reclassified two MCI subjects as healthy. Data from these two subjects was not used for further analysis. Subjects went through the experiments only once. However, there were a few subjects who had undergone the experiments more than once (annually as part of a different longitudinal study). For such subjects, we used only data from the first year. However, in the first year of study, four subjects did not have eye data and data of one participant was noisy. Further, one participant was diagnosed as MCI in the second year. Hence, for these six subjects, data from the first year was discarded and data from the second year was used instead. From the rest, we discarded data of ten subjects due to noise (nine healthy and one MCI; see Artifact Rejection subsection). Finally, we discarded one AD patient (male, aged 92 years) as he did not have any healthy age- and gender-matched control. We were thus left with 227/12/5 (females: 101/3/2) healthy/MCI/AD subjects for analysis. For the purpose of this study, we called the MCI/AD subjects as cases and their respective age- and gender-matched healthy subjects as controls. Since the subjects were directly recruited from the community based on advertisements without any prior knowledge of their clinical status (which was determined during the study itself and revealed to the experimenters after the EEG recordings were over), no explicit power calculation was done.

Experimental setup, EEG recordings, and analysis were same as what we had described in our previous study (Murty et al., 2020). Briefly, we recorded raw EEG signals from 64 active electrodes using BrainAmp DC (Brain Products GmbH, Germany) according to the international 10–10 system, referenced online at FCz. We filtered raw signals online between 0.016 Hz and 1000 Hz and sampled at 2500 Hz. We rejected electrodes whose impedance was more than 25 KΩ (4.0%, 3.4%, and 0.6% for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, respectively). Impedance of the final set of electrodes was 5.5 ± 4.2, 5.9 ± 4.4, and 3.8 ± 3.5 KΩ for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, respectively.

All subjects sat in a dark room in front of an LCD screen with their head supported by a chin rest. The screen (BenQ XL2411, resolution 1280 × 720 pixels, refresh rate 100 Hz) was gamma-corrected and placed at a mean ± SD distance of 58.1 ± 0.8 cm from the subjects (53.8–61.0 cm) according to their convenience (thus subtending a width of at least 52° and height of at least 30° of visual field for full-screen gratings). We calibrated the stimuli to the viewing distance in all cases.

Subjects performed a visual fixation task, as described in Figure 1. They performed the main ‘Gamma’ experiment in 2–3 blocks (total 543 blocks across 257 subjects) according to their comfort. We also tested 32 Hz SSVEPs on these subjects in the SSVEP experiment. We chose 32 Hz SSVEP (induced by gratings of temporal frequency of 16 cycles per second or cps) for two reasons. First, in a separate set of experiments, we had recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in the primary visual cortex of awake monkeys while presenting counterphasing gratings at varying temporal frequencies and found that the SSVEP gain was highest for gratings with temporal frequencies of 12-16 cps (Salelkar and Ray, 2020). Second, 32 Hz was between slow and fast gamma bands, hence within the available time for the experiment, we were able to record SSVEP activity closest to both the gamma rhythms.

Subjects completed both experiments during a single session. We considered only those subjects for analysis in SSVEP experiment who had analyzable data for the Gamma experiment (see Artifact Rejection section below). This gave us a total of 222/11/5 subjects (99/3/2 females) for healthy/MCI/AD categories for the SSVEP experiment.

Eye position analysis

We recorded eye signals (pupil position and diameter data) using EyeLink 1000 (SR Research Ltd) for all subjects (except for one subject each in healthy/MCI/AD categories). Eye data for Gamma experiment is shown in Figure 4. We rejected stimulus repeats with fixation breaks (eye blinks or shifts in eye position outside a square window of width 5° centered on the fixation spot) during −0.5 s to 0.75 s of stimulus onset (mean ± SD: 16.7 ± 14.2%, 12.8 ± 12%, and 31.6 ± 18.4% for Gamma experiment; and 16.7 ± 15.1%, 9.1 ± 16%, and 46.4 ± 1% for SSVEP experiment, for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, respectively). For the remaining repeats, all the subjects were able to maintain fixation with a standard deviation of less than 0.5°, 0.3°, and 0.6° for Gamma experiment and 0.6°, 0.4°, 0.6° for SSVEP experiment for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, in either directions.

Artifact rejection

We used a pipeline to reject artifact-containing data as described in Murty et al., 2020. Briefly, we applied a repeat-wise thresholding process on both time-domain waveforms and multitapered PSD (between −500 ms and 750 ms of stimulus onset) to select bad repeats across electrodes. We discarded those electrodes that had more than 30% of all repeats marked as bad, and subsequently labelled any repeat as bad if it occurred in more than 10% of total number of remaining electrodes. We next discarded those electrodes that had PSD slopes (calculated in 56-84 Hz range as described briefly in EEG data analysis subsection; see Murty et al., 2020 for details) less than 0. Further, we discarded any block that did not have at least a single clean bipolar electrode pair (see Data Analysis subsection below) in any of the following three groups of bipolar electrodes: PO3-P1, PO3-P3, POz-PO3; PO4-P2, PO4-P4, POz-PO4 and Oz-POz, Oz-O1, Oz-O2. Despite these strict criteria, we ended up rejecting only 53/497, 4/31, and 1/15 blocks for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects; and we rejected only 5.5 ± 6.4%, 5.7 ± 3.6%, and 4.1 ± 1.9% of electrodes for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, among those blocks that were analyzed. We then pooled data across all good blocks for each subject for final analysis. Those subjects who did not have any analyzable blocks (9 of 236 healthy subjects and 1 of 15 MCIs, respectively) were discarded from further analysis.

We used a similar procedure for the SSVEP experiment. Note that we did this experiment always towards the end, and therefore the signal quality could be poorer than the Gamma experiment. Consequently, we rejected 25/222, 5/12, and 3/5 blocks for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects; and 6.6 ± 7.2%, 8.5 ± 7.4%, and 5.7 ± 1% of electrodes among those blocks that were analyzed. Hence, we rejected data from 25/4/3 out of 222/11/5 subjects as they did not have any analyzable blocks, leaving 197/7/2 (93/1/1 females) healthy/MCI/AD subjects for analysis for the SSVEP experiment.

EEG data analysis

For all analyses we re-referenced data at each electrode offline to its neighboring electrodes (bipolar reference). We thus obtained 112 bipolar pairs out of 64 unipolar electrodes (Murty et al., 2020). We considered the following nine bipolar electrodes for analysis: PO3-P1, PO3-P3, POz-PO3, PO4-P2, PO4-P4, POz-PO4, Oz-POz, Oz-O1, Oz-O2, which are inside the black encapsulation shown in Figure 2D. We discarded a bipolar electrode if either of its constituting unipolar electrodes was marked bad during artifact rejection. Data was pooled for the rest of the bipolar electrodes for further analysis.

We analyzed all data using custom codes written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc, RRID:SCR_001622) as described in Murty et al., 2020. We computed PSD and the time-frequency power spectrograms using multi-taper method with a single taper using Chronux toolbox (Mitra and Bokil, 2008; http://chronux.org/, RRID:SCR_005547). We chose baseline period between −500 ms and 0 ms of stimulus onset, and stimulus period between 250 ms and 750 ms, to avoid stimulus onset-related transients, yielding a frequency resolution of 2 Hz for the PSDs. We calculated time frequency power spectra using a moving window of size 250 ms and step size of 25 ms, giving a frequency resolution of 4 Hz.

We calculated change in power in different frequency bands as follows:ΔPower=10(log10∑fST(f)∑fBL(f))

where ST and BL are stimulus and baseline power spectra (across frequencies of interest, f) averaged across all analyzable repeats and the nine bipolar electrodes as described above. As mentioned in the Results, we computed the spectra for gratings with spatial frequency of 2 and 4 cpd and all four orientations for the Gamma experiment (unless otherwise mentioned). The total number of repeats that were thus analyzed were 184.2 ± 58.3, 174.2 ± 52.1, and 126.4 ± 29.3 for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects.

To test the dependence of alpha/gamma power on different orientations (see results), we calculated orientation selectivity for each subject using the following (Murty et al., 2018):Orientationselectivity=|∑i=1NRie(j⋅2θi)|∑i=1NRi

where θi and Ri are the orientations and absolute power (µV2, for 250-750 ms after stimulus onset in the frequency band of interest), for each i = [0° 45° 90° 135°] (thus, N = 4). We averaged absolute power values across spatial frequencies for calculating the orientation selectivity.

For SSVEP experiment, we analyzed only the counter-phasing condition. There were 30.2 ± 6.9, 32.9 ± 7.5, and 17.5 ± 2.1 repeats for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, respectively. We took the power at 32 Hz (twice the counter-phasing frequency, i.e., 16 cps) for analysis. Static gratings were presented in SSVEP experiment mainly to prevent adaptation and were discarded from analysis.

We generated scalp maps using the topoplot.m function of EEGLAB toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004, RRID:SCR_007292), modified to show each electrode as a colored disc.

We calculated slopes (for Figure 5—figure supplement 1) by fitting baseline PSD averaged across all analyzable repeats and bipolar electrodes with a power law function using fminsearch in MATLAB:P(f)=A.f-β, where P is the PSD across frequencies f, A is scaling factor, and β is the slope.

Microsaccades and pupil data analysis

We detected microsaccades using a threshold-based method described earlier (Murty et al., 2018), initially proposed by Engbert, 2006, for the analysis period of −0.5 s to 0.75 s of stimulus onset for the Gamma experiment. After removing the microsaccade-containing repeats (85.6 ± 47.6, 76.5 ± 36.5, 70 ± 17.2), there were 98.5 ± 46 (minimum 7) repeats for healthy subjects (n = 226), 96.2 ± 35.7 (min: 54) for MCI (n = 11), and 64.3 ± 14.4 (min: 52) for AD subjects (n = 4), respectively, excluding three subjects for whom eye data could not be collected. We used coefficient of variation (CV, ratio of standard deviation to mean) of pupil diameter across time for every repeat as a measure of pupillary reactivity to stimulus for that repeat (Murty et al., 2020). We calculated CV for each analyzable repeat separately and calculated mean CV across repeats for every subject for comparison.

Statistical analysis

All our statistical interpretations were based on non-parametric tests on medians using K-W test (results were similar if we used Wilcoxon sign-rank test). We used two-way ANOVA for comparing change in alpha/gamma power across spatial frequencies and orientations for 227 healthy subjects (see Results section). The study is controlled at p<0.05 regardless of the sample size, since the false alarm rate does not depend on the sample size.

Bayes factor analysis

BF is the likelihood ratio of the marginal likelihood of alternate hypothesis to the likelihood of null hypothesis, given the data. This allows for comparing the alternate with null hypothesis, rather than just infer from the evidence for null hypothesis (Jarosz and Wiley, 2014; Keysers et al., 2020). In the present case, we used the Bayesian paired t-test with the Cauchy prior scaling set to 1. In this scheme, BF values below one suggests the absence of effect and evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, BF values between 1 and 3 provide anecdotal evidence in favor of the alternate hypothesis, while values between 3 and 10 provide substantial evidence and values above 10 provide strong evidence in favor of the alternative (Jeffreys, 1998). For gamma power, we calculated BF for right-tailed paired t-test (power(controls)>power(cases)), while for alpha power, we calculated BF for left-tailed paired t-test (power(controls)<power(cases)). We used the MATLAB toolbox on BF by Bart Krekelberg (Krekelberg, 2021) based on Rouder et al., 2012.

Regression analysis

We considered a linear regression model: ΔPower = β0 + βCDR.CDR + βAGE.AGE + βGENDER.GENDER + ε. Categorical variable GENDER was converted to numerical variable by considering ‘0’ for males and ‘1’ for females. The variable AGE was considered as the subject’s age in years, approximated to the integer. We used the fitlm() function in MATLAB to implement linear regression model. The function outputs significance (p-values) for the t-statistic of the null hypothesis test over coefficient of each corresponding regressor variable in the model.

Appendix 1

Consensus diagnosis

As in Table 1, our major criteria to diagnose MCI/AD were clinical history and CDR, which were administered by a single clinician (neurologist or psychiatrist). However, to minimize observer bias, we followed the recommendations made in SAGES study (Kimchi et al., 2017) to arrive at a consensus diagnosis for each MCI/AD patient. We constituted a panel with four members, consisting of one neurologist (author MJ), two psychiatrists (authors AML and NPR), and one psychologist (author AB, an additional expert who did not participate in the single clinician diagnosis before). These members independently reviewed data variables available in TLSA (Tata Longitudinal Study of Aging) cohort to operationalize the NIA-AA criteria (McKhann et al., 2011) for probable AD and MCI. For each of the NIA-AA criteria, they operationalized an equivalent TLSA criterion (see Tables 1–3 in Supplementary file 1). Wherever longitudinal data was available, they considered trends over time for diagnosis.

They labelled a subject as MCI/AD only if all 4 of them concurred with the diagnosis. When they could not achieve at a consensus for any subject in the first instance (six subjects), they used Delphi method (Dalkey and Helmer, 1963; Graham et al., 2003) till all of them agreed upon the diagnosis. Briefly, the members were informed of the discrepancy within the panel, who then discussed among themselves and rated again. This process was iterated till all four members came to a consensus. Although they used this stringent approach to confirm the previous diagnoses, they reclassified as healthy only two subjects previously classified as MCI. They confirmed and retained initial diagnosis for rest of the 12/14 MCI and 6/6 AD subjects.

Bosman Conrado A Reviewer University of Amsterdam Netherlands

In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.

Acceptance summary:

Murty and collaborators investigate alterations in stimulus-induced gamma (~30-80 Hz) oscillations in a geriatric population with early symptoms of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared with sex and age-matched controls, the authors observed a significant and specific decrease in the stimulus-induced gamma-band frequency power in the occipital cortex. This suggests that reductions in stimulus-induced gamma oscillations are an electrophysiological marker of early stages of AD and cognitive decline. The relevance of these findings is further bolstered by previous studies in animal models showing cognitive improvement following optogenetic and flicker-induced increases of gamma power. The findings will impact Alzheimer's disease research in humans and in animal models.

Decision letter after peer review:

Thank you for submitting your article "Stimulus-induced gamma rhythms are weaker in human elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Conrado A Bosman (Reviewer #2).

The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.

We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in eLife but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.

Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in eLife, either of which would be linked to the original paper.

Summary:

Murty and collaborators examined stimulus-induced gamma (~30-80 Hz) oscillations in a geriatric population with early symptoms of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared with sex and age-matched controls, the authors observed a significant and specific decrease in the stimulus-induced gamma-band frequency power during the presentation of Cartesian grating stimuli. Conversely, they did not find a gamma power decrease when subjects performed a flickering experiment using static gratings presented at 32 Hz. Overall, this study addresses an important and timely question, because stimulus-induced gamma oscillations could be considered as an electrophysiological marker of early stages of AD, and previous studies in animal models have shown cognitive improvement following optogenetic and visually induced increases of gamma power.

All reviewers agreed that the study is interesting and addresses an important question. The main concerns focused on the sample size and stimulus variability. Please see below.

Essential revisions:

Statistics and study design

A main issue that was defined by the reviewers was the sample size used in this study. The authors should address several points:

1) The authors combine both groups to obtain significant effects which are not present in the MCI-group by itself. The text seems a bit fuzzy about this point, the statistics per group should be clarified or further analysed.

2) A problem is that clinical characteristics differ substantially between the two groups and the question remains whether abnormalities in gamma-band oscillations are present prior the onset of AD. This should be discussed/considered.

3) The authors chose appropriate non-parametric tests to perform statistical inference on groups with different samples. However, they should address the rather sever unbalanced effect sizes between the control and the condition group, providing, for example, some measurement of the distribution of gamma power between the two groups. The low number of cases with AD (5) is problematic because such a small sample is at the limit of the sensibility of a KW test.

4) A revised manuscript should explicitly acknowledge that, if it is impossible to increase the sample size due to COVID-19, the paper would benefit from including more subjects.

5) There are several instances where the authors included a subject (data) for one analysis and excluded the same subject for a different analysis. Specific examples; (1) The authors mention that two of the MCI patients (M4 and M8) were later re-evaluated and found to be cognitively normal. Removing their data for the individual-level comparison of gamma PSD did not cause the differences between the "cases" and "controls" to change much (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), but it is unclear if their data were also removed from the group level data (i.e., Figure 2) and what happens to the conclusions made at the group level if their data are removed. (2) Grouped data in Figure 5A, 5C contains 12 cases but individual plots in Figure 5E contains only 11 cases ('A1 discarded'). We appreciate the authors providing the details about what is included/excluded in each analyses, but if a subject needed to be excluded because of some obvious reasons, then the authors should do it across all analysis to reduce the inconsistency in the data being analyzed.

6) It appears there is quite a clear increase in variability in the AD/MCI group as compared to the controls. Some subjects in fact show rather extremely strong gamma. It would be interesting to comment on this and quantify this.

7) Please provide dot-plots with the bar plots to see how the 6 AD subjects are scattered and the 14 MCI cases, and how robust the effects are.

8) Evaluation of diagnostic and inclusion criteria by an AD-expert would be recommended.

Stimuli

9) Is the difference between groups is driven by a specific spatial frequency and orientation of the gratings? During the experiment with gratings, the authors presented a sequence of gratings with different spatial frequencies. According to the manuscript, the presentation sequence and the number of trials with the same stimuli were fixed according to a preliminary experiment aiming to obtain the most responsive parameters per subject. However, it is well-known that stimulus properties affect the gamma power increase in visual areas. We suggest adding a control analysis comparing only those trials with the same type of gratings between subjects to discard that any differences due to stimuli properties are affecting these results.

10) The authors used multiple spatial frequencies and orientations for the 'gamma experiment', but they do not provide any frequency- or orientation-specific data, which makes it difficult to conclude if a specific frequency and/or orientation are driving the difference seen between the cases and the controls and thus more ideal than other combinations of frequencies and orientations. None of the spectrograms for 'gamma experiment' has any information about stimulus details. The authors are advised to provide more thorough quantitative analyses.

Data analysis

11) The authors do not analyze ERPs. Do those differ between subjects?

12) Does the difference between groups hold/changes if the gamma band is not broken up into slow and fast gamma band and instead analyzed as a single band (e.g., 30 – 80Hz).

13) The authors can maximize the utility of the microsaccades analysis used as a control. In the text, there is no context about why this analysis should be performed. Some authors have argued that a microsaccadic rhythm can modulate the strength of gamma-band power. It would be relevant to observe whether such microsaccades modulations can contribute differently to the strength of the gamma-band power across groups.

Questions about SSVEP experiments

14) What does it mean that there was a reduction in fast gamma (36-66Hz) when the real evoked signal was at 32Hz (and that 32Hz was not different between cases and controls) in SSVEP experiment?

15) There is a time lag between stimulus onset /off and spectral power change (>100ms) in both 'gamma experiment and SSVEP' but maybe more pronounced in SSVEP (Figure 5B). It would be informative if the authors can examine the spectral/waveform differences between control and cases within +/- 200 ms from stimulus onset (in other words, whether AD patients showed delayed response compared to controls?).

16) The authors should provide more explanation on how they extracted the "induced" gamma-band power from the SSVEP experiment (i.e., how they derived Figure 5—figure supplement 1A from Figure 5A). Were EEG signals phase-locked to the stimulation removed?

17) We presume the authors aimed to induce gamma oscillations at 32 Hz stimulation during the SSVP experiments. Yet, that number seems arbitrary. It may have been preferable to observe the same experiment across different flickering frequencies. It could help if the authors could show examples of ERP responses at the 32 Hz flickering, also analyzing the amplitude of the ERP components. A non-significant difference between amplitudes across groups would add evidence that the response observed is specific for gamma frequency-band and that it is not a consequence of this particular type of stimulation.

Discussion

18) The authors did not reference a study with seemingly contradictory findings (conducted by van Deursen et al.; J Neural Transm 2008), in which the gamma band (30 – 100 Hz) power induced by visual stimulation was actually higher in patients with AD at the occipital and parietal leads compared to the control subjects. The authors should discuss why their findings are different from those by van Deursen et al. and the potential implications of the differences.

19) Conceptually, the findings presented here may suggest that the gratings and SSVEP evoked gamma is sub-served by different mechanisms. The authors should discuss this.

[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]

Thank you for submitting your article "Stimulus-induced gamma rhythms are weaker in human elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Martin Vinck as the Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Conrado A Bosman (Reviewer #2).

The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see, most of the concerns have been addressed but a few concerns remain, as detailed below.

Essential revisions:

1) The relatively small sample size of the study remained a point of discussion among the reviewers, with consideration of the fact that the COVID situation prevented collecting a larger dataset. We have several recommendations related to the sample size:

i) It would be useful to point out the known fact that a small sample size does not increase the false alarm rate, hence the study is controlled at P<0.05 (regardless of the sample size).

ii) Given the small sample size, it would be good if the authors briefly justify the selection of the sample size. Was this a priori chosen, was there any power calculation?

iii) Reporting Bayes factor, esp. given that this is a medically relevant study, would be useful given the sample size.

2) The authors have adequately addressed major concerns in the revised manuscript. However, the authors need to address a few additional points. Especially, on Page 16, lines 348-352, and Page 17, lines 353-358, why do the authors think that their findings contradict findings of Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., and Thomson et al.? The current findings are in no meaningful way comparable to Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., and Thomson et al. Did the authors induce 40 Hz repeatedly and measured any cognitive and pathology outcomes? Or did Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., showed SSVEP changes at 32 Hz in any human AD or mouse AD. The authors should provide a nuanced interpretation of their findings.

3) Page 5, lines 87-95, where is the corresponding graph or data points? If the authors would like to not include any additional graph, at least they should provide values for which they performed statistical analyses.

4) Given that the authors have CDR score for all subjects, it would be helpful to perform a regression analyses and provide an additional insight as to whether there is a correlation between CDR score and sensory evoked gamma. This is not an additional experiment but an additional analysis of the datasets to get an insight.

Reviewer #2:

The authors have addressed my comments satisfactorily and I endorse the publication of the manuscript as such. I congratulate the authors for their work.

Reviewer #3:

While I find the topic and approach taken in this study important as previously highlighted, I remain unconvinced that the current sample of MCI-participants (n = 12) and AD-patients (n = 5) is sufficiently large enough to allow for robust conclusions. It is unfortunate that in the current situation, additional data-collection is not immediately possible. However, this would be required to substantiate these findings. In the current format, the findings are promising pilot-data which require replication in a significantly larger sample. Accordingly, I cannot recommend publication of the article in eLife.

Reviewer #4:

The authors have adequately addressed major concerns in the revised manuscript. However, the authors need to address a few additional points. Especially, on Page 16, lines 348-352, and Page 17, lines 353-358, why do the authors think that their findings contradict findings of Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., and Thomson et al.? The current findings are in no meaningful way comparable to Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., and Thomson et al. Did the authors induce 40 Hz repeatedly and measured any cognitive and pathology outcomes? Or did Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., showed SSVEP changes at 32 Hz in any human AD or mouse AD. The authors should provide a nuanced interpretation of their findings.

Other points:

1. Page 5, lines 87-95, where is the corresponding graph or data points? If the authors would like to not include any additional graph, at least they should provide values for which they performed statistical analyses.

2. Given that the authors have CDR score for all subjects, it would be helpful to perform a regression analyses and provide an additional insight as to whether there is a correlation between CDR score and sensory evoked gamma. This is not an additional experiment but an additional analysis of the datasets to get an insight.

1) The authors combine both groups to obtain significant effects which are not present in the MCI-group by itself. The text seems a bit fuzzy about this point, the statistics per group should be clarified or further analysed.

Thank you for raising this issue. We have now done the analysis on MCI and AD subjects separately (Figures 2 and 3); the analysis of MCI+AD data is only shown as a supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Statistics have been clarified and presented uniformly.

2) A problem is that clinical characteristics differ substantially between the two groups and the question remains whether abnormalities in gamma-band oscillations are present prior the onset of AD. This should be discussed/considered.

Thank you for raising this issue. We now show reduction in gamma oscillations in MCI group separately, compared to their age and gender matched controls. We have presented these results in Figure 2 and have also included relevant statistics in the Results section.

3) The authors chose appropriate non-parametric tests to perform statistical inference on groups with different samples. However, they should address the rather sever unbalanced effect sizes between the control and the condition group, providing, for example, some measurement of the distribution of gamma power between the two groups. The low number of cases with AD (5) is problematic because such a small sample is at the limit of the sensibility of a KW test.

Thank you for raising this point. In our revised manuscript, we have now averaged the data from control subjects such that the final comparison is now done across equal samples (i.e. 12 MCIs and 12 averages of respective controls). Further, we have tested our results by limiting the number of control subjects that were averaged per case subject. The results continue to remain significant for several choices of this limit (we show results for N=1, and also present stats for N=4, which is the minimum number of controls for each case subject).

The low number of AD subjects is indeed problematic, but this number cannot be increased because of the pandemic. We note, however, that the results hold separately for MCIs, for which we have 12 subjects, and the results are robust and significant in the AD cohort (Figure 3) in spite of the small number of subjects.

4) A revised manuscript should explicitly acknowledge that, if it is impossible to increase the sample size due to COVID-19, the paper would benefit from including more subjects.

Thank you for this suggestion. We have acknowledged this limitation in the Results section.

5) There are several instances where the authors included a subject (data) for one analysis and excluded the same subject for a different analysis. Specific examples; (1) The authors mention that two of the MCI patients (M4 and M8) were later re-evaluated and found to be cognitively normal. Removing their data for the individual-level comparison of gamma PSD did not cause the differences between the "cases" and "controls" to change much (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), but it is unclear if their data were also removed from the group level data (i.e., Figure 2) and what happens to the conclusions made at the group level if their data are removed. (2) Grouped data in Figure 5A, 5C contains 12 cases but individual plots in Figure 5E contains only 11 cases ('A1 discarded'). We appreciate the authors providing the details about what is included/excluded in each analyses, but if a subject needed to be excluded because of some obvious reasons, then the authors should do it across all analysis to reduce the inconsistency in the data being analyzed.

Thank you for raising this issue. We have followed your suggestion and have removed MCI subjects M4 and M8; and AD patient A1 (mentioned in the suggestion above) from all our analyses. Hence, now we have analyzed 12 MCIs and 5 ADs and have maintained consistency across the revised manuscript.

6) It appears there is quite a clear increase in variability in the AD/MCI group as compared to the controls. Some subjects in fact show rather extremely strong gamma. It would be interesting to comment on this and quantify this.

Thank you for raising this issue. The reason behind this apparent increase in variability is simply because each control data point is the average of many subjects. When we compare the variability of a single control subject versus case subject, the variability is actually comparable. We have now added this in the Results section.

7) Please provide dot-plots with the bar plots to see how the 6 AD subjects are scattered and the 14 MCI cases, and how robust the effects are.

Done.

8) Evaluation of diagnostic and inclusion criteria by an AD-expert would be recommended.

The expert panel, consisting of one neurologist (author MJ), two psychiatrists (authors AML and NPR) and one psychologist (author AB, an additional expert who did not participate in the single clinician diagnosis before), are all clinicians who have been involved in AD related research for several years.

Stimuli

9) Is the difference between groups is driven by a specific spatial frequency and orientation of the gratings? During the experiment with gratings, the authors presented a sequence of gratings with different spatial frequencies. According to the manuscript, the presentation sequence and the number of trials with the same stimuli were fixed according to a preliminary experiment aiming to obtain the most responsive parameters per subject. However, it is well-known that stimulus properties affect the gamma power increase in visual areas. We suggest adding a control analysis comparing only those trials with the same type of gratings between subjects to discard that any differences due to stimuli properties are affecting these results.

Thank you for raising this point. Although gamma oscillations are indeed dependent on orientation, the orientation selectively is substantially weaker in EEG as compared to animal recordings (see Murty et al., 2018, JNS for a direct comparison between human and monkey data). We repeated this analysis here as well as found the same results: orientation only had a modest effect on gamma, and therefore we pooled the results across orientations. For spatial frequency, we did find that 2 and 4 CPD produced better results than 1 CPD. Therefore, we performed the main analyses using only 2 and 4 CPD. However, results remained qualitatively similar when 1 CPD was included. Spatial-frequency specific results have now been added as a separate supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for MCI subjects and their controls; and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 for AD subjects and their controls).

We also note that for the main “Gamma” experiment, each subject (case and control) viewed all four orientations and three spatial frequencies, so the difference in gamma could not be due to any difference in stimuli between cases and controls. It is only for the SSVEP protocol that we fixed the SF and Ori to a single value in the interest of time.

10) The authors used multiple spatial frequencies and orientations for the 'gamma experiment', but they do not provide any frequency- or orientation-specific data, which makes it difficult to conclude if a specific frequency and/or orientation are driving the difference seen between the cases and the controls and thus more ideal than other combinations of frequencies and orientations. None of the spectrograms for 'gamma experiment' has any information about stimulus details. The authors are advised to provide more thorough quantitative analyses.

Thank you for this suggestion. As discussed in the previous point, gamma is not very orientation selective in EEG, and limiting ourselves to the two best spatial frequencies (2 and 4 CPDs) actually marginally improved the results. We have included this analysis in the Results section (first paragraph and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).

Data analysis

11) The authors do not analyze ERPs. Do those differ between subjects?

Thank you for this question. ERPs were not different between MCIs and controls. Specifically, we did not find any significant difference between P1/N1/P2 peak amplitudes. We have now added a figure showing these analyses (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).

12) Does the difference between groups hold/changes if the gamma band is not broken up into slow and fast gamma band and instead analyzed as a single band (e.g., 30 – 80Hz).

Thank you for this question. The results hold well for both 20-66 Hz and 30-80 Hz. We have added these in the Results section.

13) The authors can maximize the utility of the microsaccades analysis used as a control. In the text, there is no context about why this analysis should be performed. Some authors have argued that a microsaccadic rhythm can modulate the strength of gamma-band power. It would be relevant to observe whether such microsaccades modulations can contribute differently to the strength of the gamma-band power across groups.

Thank you for this suggestion. We have now added a supplementary figure to show the analysis of repeats that had micro saccades (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We have also added the context and the appropriate reference (Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008) in the Results section. Results remained similar with or without microsaccades containing trials.

Questions about SSVEP experiments

14) What does it mean that there was a reduction in fast gamma (36-66Hz) when the real evoked signal was at 32Hz (and that 32Hz was not different between cases and controls) in SSVEP experiment?

Thank you for this question. For the SSVEP experiment, the real evoked signal was at 32 Hz. However, as noted in the reply to point 16 below, we did not calculate gamma power from the SSVEP experiment. Fast gamma power was calculated from the gamma experiment for the same set of subjects (7 MCIs) as for the SSVEP experiment, for comparing between the gamma and SSVEP results. Further, the differences in the trends of gamma and SSVEP suggest that these may have different origins and/or generating mechanisms in the brain. We have made these points clearer in the manuscript now.

15) There is a time lag between stimulus onset /off and spectral power change (>100ms) in both 'gamma experiment and SSVEP' but maybe more pronounced in SSVEP (Figure 5B). It would be informative if the authors can examine the spectral/waveform differences between control and cases within +/- 200 ms from stimulus onset (in other words, whether AD patients showed delayed response compared to controls?).

Thank you for this suggestion. SSVEP onset-related responses (0-250 ms) were comparable between MCIs and their respective controls as seen in the median time-courses of stimulus-induced change in power in 20-66 Hz frequency range. The RMS amplitude, peak amplitude and time of the peak of the onset response (calculated from trial-averaged time-courses for each subject) also did not differ among MCI subjects and their respective controls (KW test; χ2(13)=0.33/0.92/1.48, p=0.56/0.34/0.22 for RMS-amplitude/peak-amplitude/peak-time). We have now added a figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D-E) and the respective analyses in the Results section.

16) The authors should provide more explanation on how they extracted the "induced" gamma-band power from the SSVEP experiment (i.e., how they derived Figure 5—figure supplement 1A from Figure 5A). Were EEG signals phase-locked to the stimulation removed?

Thank you for pointing this out. We have not extracted induced gamma-band power from the SSVEP experiment. Instead, we had repeated the analysis done in Figure 2 for those subjects who had undergone the SSVEP experiment, for a comparison. We have made this clearer in the manuscript.

17) We presume the authors aimed to induce gamma oscillations at 32 Hz stimulation during the SSVP experiments. Yet, that number seems arbitrary. It may have been preferable to observe the same experiment across different flickering frequencies.

Thank you for raising this issue. We could not include more counter-phasing gratings for the study due to time constraints involved in the project. As we were working with elderly population in collaboration with clinical teams, we had strict timelines. However, we chose 32 Hz SSVEP (induced by gratings of temporal frequency of 16 cycles per second) for two reasons. First, in a different study, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in the primary visual cortex of awake monkeys. We found that the SSVEP gain was highest for gratings with temporal frequencies of 12 to 16 cps (Salelkar and Ray, 2020). Second, 32 Hz was between the slow and fast gamma bands, hence within the available time, we were able to record SSVEP activity closest to both the gamma rhythms. We have now added these points in the Methods section.

It could help if the authors could show examples of ERP responses at the 32 Hz flickering, also analyzing the amplitude of the ERP components. A non-significant difference between amplitudes across groups would add evidence that the response observed is specific for gamma frequency-band and that it is not a consequence of this particular type of stimulation.

Thank you for this suggestion. We performed time-frequency analysis on trial-averaged time-amplitude waveforms for each subject instead for averaging time-frequency spectra of individual repeats for each subject, as done for SSVEP analysis in Figure 6. Trends were not different between either analyses. We have now summarized the results in Figure 6—figure supplement 2.

Discussion

18) The authors did not reference a study with seemingly contradictory findings (conducted by van Deursen et al.; J Neural Transm 2008), in which the gamma band (30 – 100 Hz) power induced by visual stimulation was actually higher in patients with AD at the occipital and parietal leads compared to the control subjects. The authors should discuss why their findings are different from those by van Deursen et al. and the potential implications of the differences.

Thank you for this suggestion. Our findings are different from the study of van Deursen et al., probably due to the differences in task settings: we had tested for visual gamma rhythms induced by gratings, whereas they had tested for resting-state gamma as well as gamma activity for multiple colored objects randomly moving on a computer screen (taken from screensavers). Whether our results hold true for drifting (moving) and chromatic gratings needs to be tested in future studies. We have added these points and the reference in the Discussion section now.

19) Conceptually, the findings presented here may suggest that the gratings and SSVEP evoked gamma is sub-served by different mechanisms. The authors should discuss this.

Thank you for this suggestion. We have added this in the Discussion section now. However, we have avoided extensive discussion because the comparison between SSVEP and gamma is based on limited data and therefore we did not want to speculate too much.

[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]

Essential revisions:

1) The relatively small sample size of the study remained a point of discussion among the reviewers, with consideration of the fact that the COVID situation prevented collecting a larger dataset. We have several recommendations related to the sample size:

i) It would be useful to point out the known fact that a small sample size does not increase the false alarm rate, hence the study is controlled at P<0.05 (regardless of the sample size).

Thank you for this suggestion. We have included this statement in Statistical analysis section of Methods.

ii) Given the small sample size, it would be good if the authors briefly justify the selection of the sample size. Was this a priori chosen, was there any power calculation?

Thank you for pointing this out. This was a community based study, in which subjects were recruited from the community based on advertisements, without any prior knowledge of their cognitive status. Their clinical identity was determined by trained clinicians and psychologists through various tests (as described in the paper) and was revealed to us after the experiments were over. Therefore, no power calculation was done. We have made this clear in the Methods section.

iii) Reporting Bayes factor, esp. given that this is a medically relevant study, would be useful given the sample size.

Thank you very much for this excellent suggestion. We performed this analysis and found that the results were highly consistent with our previous statistical tests. In summary, for the MCI group (N=12), the Bayes factor (BF) was ~1.89 for both slow and fast gamma when standard frequency ranges were used. However, as noted in the paper, we used fixed frequency ranges for the two gamma bands even though the difference between cases and controls was visible only in the middle of the bands. Simply choosing more “sensitive” gamma ranges (26-34 Hz for slow gamma and 44-56 Hz for fast gamma) yielded BFs of 3.34 and 4.6, thereby providing substantial evidence in favour of the alternate hypothesis even when only MCIs were considered. Upon considering both MCI and AD groups together (N=17), the BFs were 13.70 and 8.60 for the two gamma bands, providing strong evidence in favour of the alternate over the null hypothesis.

2) The authors have adequately addressed major concerns in the revised manuscript. However, the authors need to address a few additional points. Especially, on Page 16, lines 348-352, and Page 17, lines 353-358, why do the authors think that their findings contradict findings of Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., and Thomson et al.? The current findings are in no meaningful way comparable to Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., and Thomson et al. Did the authors induce 40 Hz repeatedly and measured any cognitive and pathology outcomes? Or did Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., showed SSVEP changes at 32 Hz in any human AD or mouse AD. The authors should provide a nuanced interpretation of their findings.

Thank you for raising this point. As the reviewer has rightly pointed out, we cannot draw a direct comparison of our study with the studies cited above. This is because the model organism as well as the entrainment frequencies are different in our study. We have now made this point clear in the Discussion section.

3) Page 5, lines 87-95, where is the corresponding graph or data points? If the authors would like to not include any additional graph, at least they should provide values for which they performed statistical analyses.

Thank you for pointing this out. We have now made a separate figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) showing these data.

4) Given that the authors have CDR score for all subjects, it would be helpful to perform a regression analyses and provide an additional insight as to whether there is a correlation between CDR score and sensory evoked gamma. This is not an additional experiment but an additional analysis of the datasets to get an insight.

Thank you for this suggestion. We have included this regression analysis, and it does show a significant effect for both gamma ranges (slow gamma: βCDR = -0.57, p = 0.0017; fast gamma: βCDR = -0.25, p = 0.0063) but not for the alpha range, consistent with other results presented earlier.
