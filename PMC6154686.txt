1. Introduction
The first hydroxamic acid (oxalohydroxamic acid [1]) was discovered by Lossen as early as 1869. However, hydroxamic acids attracted further attention at the beginning of the 1980s because of their bioactivity [2]. Their pharmacological properties are related to their ability to scavenge metal ions [3]. In addition, they are able to generate nitric oxide [3,4,5] in living systems. In this way, they can act as antimicrobial [6,7,8,9], antitumour [6,10], antihypertensive [11], anti-inflammatory [6,12], and neuroleptic agents, among others [3,13].

According to the literature data, aromatic hydroxamic acids are useful compounds [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. However, only limited information is available about their reactions [24,25] and, in particular, about the properties of alicyclic derivatives [26,27].

Though the hydroxamic acid moiety is an important key pharmacophore in most cases, it is usually built up just in the last step of the synthesis [28,29,30]. Previously, we have examined the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the domino reaction of 2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acids with 2-formylbenzoic acid and 2,3-dimethoxy-6-formylbenzoic acid to form new isoindolo[2,1-a]quinazolines and pyrimido[2,1-a]isoindoles [31].

Focusing on the biological potential of fused quinazolinones, and continuing our work on the synthesis of novel N-heterocycles, herein, we report the synthesis of a new series of pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolinones and pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidines starting from hydroxamic acids. Pyrroloquinazolines and pyrrolopyrimidines are important heterocyclic ring systems that occur as a core structure in a variety of naturally occurring alkaloids and synthetic compounds. Pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolines are tricyclic compounds with great potential and combine the quinazoline substructure, a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry, with a pyrrole [32]. Their synthetic methods are rather scarce but the past five years have brought efficient new synthetic strategies which could lead to an increased interest in pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolines in the near future, mainly for their potential applications in medicinal chemistry [33,34,35,36,37,38].

Pyrrolopyrimidines display a broad applicability in medicinal chemistry exhibiting antimicrobial [39,40,41,42,43], antitumour [44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58], antiasthmatic [59], antihypertensive [60], and anti-inflammatory [61] activities. Several method have been developed for synthesizing pyrrolopyrimidines in the last few years [62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70].

We recently reported an efficient and convenient procedure for the preparation of pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidines starting from 2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acids [31]. The synthesis was based on the domino ring-closure reaction of hydroxamic acids with oxocarboxylic acids, followed by RDA reaction of the tetracyclic intermediates.

The present target derivatives were planned to be prepared by a two-step strategy: first, the domino ring-closure reaction of diendo- and diexo-2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acid with levulinic acid and α-ketoglutaric acid was carried out, followed by the second step involving the RDA reaction of the formed tetracycles by the loss of cyclopentadiene.

Domino reactions with hydroxamic acids are not well-documented in the literature. There are examples for the main simple ring-closures with cyclic anhydrides [19], aldehydes [71], sodium nitrite [20], carbon disulfide [72], formic acid, or acetyl chloride [17].

Our present aim was (i) to examine the domino ring-closure reaction of diendo- and diexo-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acids 1 and 2, (ii) to develop the retro Diels-Alder reaction of the tetracyclic heterocycles formed, and to extend this methodology to obtain novel racemic and enantiomeric pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives.

2. Results and Discussion
Racemic diendo- and diexo-2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acids (±)-1 and (±)-2 were prepared from the appropriate ester bases with aqueous hydroxylamine solution according to an earlier procedure [31]. The enantiomers of 2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acid (+)-1, (–)-1, (+)-2, and (–)-2 were prepared from racemic esters via diastereomeric salt formation with O,O’-di-p-toluoyl-tartaric acid (DPTTA) and O,O’-di-benzoyl-tartaric acid (DBTA) as previously described [31].

In the optimization experiments of the domino reactions of levulinic acid and α-ketoglutaric acid with racemic diendo-2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acid (±)-1 and diexo-2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acid (±)-2, conventional heating or microwave irradiation was applied. The reaction time was significantly shorter in the microwave reactor: the best results were achieved in ethanol stirred at 100 °C for 1 h.

In the domino reaction of 1 and 2 with levulinic acid and α-ketoglutaric acid, the first Schiff base A is produced, which undergoes a ring-closure reaction to produce the quinazoline epimers B and C, which are formed from A through a ring-chain tautomerism. The second ring-closure involves epimers B and C that yields compounds D and E (Scheme 1) [68].

The NMR spectra revealed the formation of two diastereomers of the methanopyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolines D and E (Scheme 1). Unfortunately, we were not able to separate the diastereomers by column chromatography despite the use of a range of eluent combinations (for example: EtOAc, EtOAc/hexane = 1:1, EtOAc/MeOH = 9:1, CHCl3/MeOH = 9:1, or toluene/MeOH = 4:1). Fortunately, after derivatization with diazomethane, the diastereomers (±)-3a, (±)-3b and (±)-4a, (±)-4b could be easily separated by column chromatography eluted with EtOAc (Scheme 2).

The stereochemistry of (±)-3a and (±)-4b was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The relative configuration of the COOCH3 group at C-3a and the bridgehead hydrogens of C-5a and C-9a have the same steric orientation in the (±)-3a and (±)-4b tetracyclic derivatives (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

In order to produce racemic pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine 5, the retro Diels-Alder reaction of the methanopyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazoline derivatives was examined in the microwave reactor under varied conditions. The best results for the cycloreversion were achieved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at 250 °C (20 min).

The synthetic method described above was extended for the preparation of the enantiomerically pure substances, via the protocol described for the racemic substances. The domino ring-closure reaction of diendo-2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acid enantiomer (+)-1 resulted in (–)-3a and (–)-3b, while that with the diexo-2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acid enantiomer (+)-2 resulted in epimers (–)-4a and (+)-4b. After their separation, the RDA reactions of tetracycles could easily be achieved, resulting in pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine (+)-5 and (–)-5 (Scheme 2).

We attempted to use the same methodology to synthesize racemic 8. In this case, however, the ring-closure reaction with levulinic acid resulted in only a small quantity of the minor diastereomers (±)-6b and (±)-7b, which could not be isolated. The stereochemistry of (±)-6a was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The relative configuration of the CH3 group at the C-3a asymmetric centre and the bridgehead hydrogens of C-5a and C-9a have the same steric orientation in (±)-6a (Figure 3).

We selected an economically better approach for the synthesis of (+)-8 and (–)-8. Namely, we carried out the cycloreversions of the major methanopyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazoline derivatives (+)-6a, (–)-6a, (+)-7a, and (–)-7a and isolated the pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidines (+)-8 and (–)-8 in 55–57% yields (see Scheme 3 and Scheme 4).

The absolute configuration of the newly built asymmetric centre of (+)-7a and (–)-7a was determined by chemical correlation: the absolute configurations of the starting 2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acids, and the relative configuration of (±)-6a from the X-ray diffraction analysis was known. When (+)-7a was heated under the RDA reaction conditions, (–)-8 was gained. In addition, the RDA product of (+)-6a also afforded (–)-8. In contrast, when (–)-7a and (–)-6a were treated under the RDA reaction conditions, (+)-8 was formed. The NMR and HPLC data (retention times: (–)-8: 41.91 min, opposite enantiomer (+)-8: 34.19 min) and comparison of the optical rotations revealed that the final compound was identical to that of (R)-1-methoxy-8a-methyl-1,7,8,8a-tetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine-2,6-dione (–)-8. Since this asymmetric centre was not affected during the RDA reaction, these results allow for the assumption that the absolute configuration of position 3a of (+)-7a is R, and that of (–)-7a is S.

3.2.1. Synthesis of Methanopyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazoline Derivatives (–)-3a, (–)-3b, (–)-4a, and (+)-4b
A mixture of 2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acid (+)-1 or (+)-2 (336 mg, 2 mmol), and α-ketoglutaric acid (292 mg, 2 mmol) was dissolved in 6 mL EtOH in a 10 mL pressurized reaction vial and the solution was stirred at 100 °C for 1 h at max 300 W microwave irradiation. Then the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and the crude product was crystallized from Et2O. The crystals isolated were dissolved in MeOH and a diazomethane/Et2O mixture was added dropwise to the solution at ambient temperature and was stirred for 30 min. The reaction was followed by TLC. (Diazomethane is a very harmful and hazardous reagent and must be handled with caution! This reaction should be performed in a well-ventilated hood!) The solvent was then removed by evaporation and the residue was dissolved in 2 mL EtOAc and transferred to a silica gel column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and eluted with EtOAc. The product was crystallized from iPr2O to produce white crystals.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, new racemic and enantiomeric pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidines were synthesized starting from diendo- and diexo-2-aminonorbornene hydroxamic acids. Their domino ring closure reactions with α-ketoglutaric acid and levulinic acid, and the formation of two diastereomers were observed in each case. After separation by column chromatography, single diastereomers were subjected to a microwave-mediated RDA reaction and gained bicyclic pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidines through the loss of cyclopentadiene. When enantiomeric diexo- or diendo-3-amino-N-hydroxybicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxamides were used, the products were enantiomeric heterocycles with ee = 95–99%, demonstrating that the starting compounds are excellent chiral sources, and the stereochemical information can be effectively transferable to the newly formed stereogenic centre.
