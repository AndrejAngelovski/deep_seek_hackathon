Chemical_context   
Hydrazones are a class of organic compounds that possess an R1R2C=NNH2 structural motif. They are related to ketones and aldehydes in which oxygen has been replaced with an NNH2 group (Rollas & Küçükgüzel, 2007 ▸). Azomethines, –NHN=CH–, constitute an important class of compounds for new drug development. The reaction of a hydrazine or hydrazide with aldehydes and ketones yields hydrazones. Hydrazones are important in drug design as they act as ligands for metal complexes, organocatalysis and the synthesis of organic compounds. The C=N bond of the hydrazone and the terminal nitro­gen atom containing a lone pair of electron is responsible for the physical and chemical properties. The C atom in the hydrazone unit has both electrophilic and nucleophilic character and both the N atoms are nucleophilic, although the amino-type nitro­gen is more reactive. As a result of these properties, hydrazones are widely used in organic synthesis. Owing to their ease of preparation and diverse pharmacological potential, much work on hydrazones has been carried out by medicinal chemists to develop agents with better activity and low toxicity profiles. Hydrazones are known to possess diverse biological activities such as anti­microbial, anti–inflammatory, anti­cancer and anti­malarial (Yousef et al., 2003 ▸; Trepanier et al., 1966 ▸) and have been evaluated for inhibition of PDE10A, a phospho­diesterase responsible for neurological and psychological disorders such as Parkinson’s, schizophrenia and Huntington’s disease (Gage et al., 2011 ▸). The anti­convulsant potential of some hydrazone derivatives having long duration and rapid onset of action have been reported (Kaushik et al., 2010 ▸), as has their anti-depressant activity (de Oliveira et al., 2011 ▸).

Schiff bases are used widely in the field of coordination chemistry and have inter­esting properties (Morshedi et al., 2009 ▸; Zhou et al., 2006 ▸; Khanmohammadi et al., 2009 ▸). These compounds are synthesized by condensation of carbonyl compounds with amines (van den Ancker et al., 2006 ▸; Hamaker et al., 2010 ▸). In addition, free Schiff base compounds are reported to possess anti­microbial (Aslantas et al., 2009 ▸) and non-linear optical (Karakaş et al., 2008 ▸) properties. Our previous work on (E)-4-bromo-N′ -(2,4-di­hydroxy­benzyl­idene)benzohydrazide and (E)-4-toluic -N′-(2,4-di­hydroxy­benzyl­idene)benzohydrazide have been recently reported (Arunagiri et al., 2018a
 ▸,b
 ▸). This work has been a guide for the development of the new Schiff base title compound, which possesses electronic and non-linear properties. As part of our inter­est in the identification of bioactive compounds, we report herein on its crystal structure.


Structural commentary   
The mol­ecular structure of the title compound is shown in Fig. 1 ▸(a). The mol­ecule adopts an (E) configuration across the C=N bond, joining the hydrazide group and the benzene ring. In the crystal, the dihedral angle between the bromo- and methyl-substituted benzene rings is 16.1 (3)°. The structure was optimized with the Gaussian09W software (Frisch et al., 2009 ▸) using the DFT–B3LYP/6–311G(d,p) method, providing information about the geometry of the mol­ecule. The optimized structure is shown in Fig. 1 ▸(b). The geometrical parameters (Table 1 ▸) are mostly within normal ranges, the slight deviations of the theoretical values from those determined experimentally are due to the fact that the optimization is performed in isolated conditions, whereas the crystal environment and hydrogen-bonding inter­actions affect the results of the X-ray structure (Zainuri et al., 2017 ▸).

The hydrazide unit (N1/N2/C1/C8–C10) is essentially planar, with a maximum deviation from the least-squares plane of 0.099 (4) Å for atom C10. The O1=C8 bond length [1.225 (6) and 1.219 Å for XRD and B3LYP, respectively] indicates single-bond character. The N1—N2 bond length [1.379 (5) Å for XRD and 1.364 Å for B3LYP] is in good agreement with other experimental values (Sivajeyanthi et al., 2017 ▸). The C—N bond lengths range from a typical single bond [C8—N1 = 1.351 (6) Å] to a double bond [C9=N2 = 1.270 (6) Å (Sivajeyanthi et al., 2017 ▸; Arunagiri et al., 2018a
 ▸,b
 ▸).

Supra­molecular features   
In the crystal, N1—H1⋯O1i and C9—H9⋯O1i hydrogen bonds (Table 2 ▸) connect symmetry-related mol­ecules through classical N—H⋯O and weak C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming (6) ring motifs and generating [100] chains (Fig. 2 ▸).

Hirshfeld surface analysis   
Hirshfeld surface analysis (McKinnon et al., 2007 ▸; Spackman & Jayatilaka, 2009 ▸) along with decomposed 2D fingerprint plots (Spackman & McKinnon, 2002 ▸; McKinnon et al., 2004 ▸, 2007 ▸) mapped over d
norm, shape-index and curvedness were used to visualize and qu­antify the inter­molecular inter­actions. The Hirshfeld surface (HS) and fingerprint plots were generated based on the d
i and d
e distances using Crystal Explorer3.1 (Wolff et al., 2012 ▸) where d
i is the distance from the nearest atom inside the surface, while d
e is the distance from the HS to the nearest atom outside the surface. In the d
norm surfaces, large circular depressions (deep red) are the indicators of hydrogen-bonding contacts whereas other visible spots are due to H⋯H contacts. The dominant H⋯O inter­action in the title compound is evident as a bright-red area in Fig. 3 ▸ while the light-red spots are due to N—H⋯O and C—H⋯O inter­actions. The shape-index surface [Fig. 4 ▸(a)] conveys information about each donor–acceptor pair and while the curvedness surface [Fig. 4 ▸(b)] is effectively divided into sets of patches, respectively. The tiny extent of area and light colour on the surface indicates weaker and longer contacts other than hydrogen bonds. The 2D fingerprint plots in Fig. 5 ▸ shows the relative contributions from the various inter­molecular contacts (O⋯H, H⋯H, C⋯H, C⋯C, N⋯H, N⋯N, O.·Br and C.·Br) in the crystal structure. The H⋯H contacts (36%) make the largest contribution, followed by C⋯H/H⋯C (28.2%), O⋯H/H⋯O (10.2%) and N⋯H/H⋯N (7.5%), the latter inter­actions being represented by blue spikes on both sides at the bottom of the plot.

Frontier mol­ecular orbitals and Mol­ecular electrostatic potential analysis   
The highest-occupied mol­ecular orbital (HOMO), which acts as an electron donor, and the lowest-unoccupied mol­ecular orbital (LUMO), which acts as an electron acceptor, are very important parameters for quantum chemistry. If the energy gap is small, then the mol­ecule is highly polarizable and has high chemical reactivity. The energy levels were computed by the DFTB3LYP/6-311G(d,p) method (Becke et al., 1993 ▸) as implemented in GAUSSIAN09W (Frisch et al., 2009 ▸). The electron transition from the HOMO to the LUMO energy level is shown in Fig. 6 ▸. The mol­ecular orbital of HOMO contain both σ and π electron-density character, whereas the LUMO is mainly composed of π-orbital density. The energy band gap (ΔE) of the mol­ecule is about 4.42 eV.

The Gauss-Sum2.2 program (O’Boyle et al., 2008 ▸) was used to calculate group contributions to the mol­ecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) and prepare the density of states (DOS) spectrum shown in Fig. 7 ▸. The DOS spectrum was formed by convoluting the mol­ecular orbital information with GAUSSIAN curves of unit height. The green and red lines in the DOS spectrum indicate the HOMO and LUMO levels. The DOS spectrum supports the energy gap calculated by HOMO–LUMO analysis. A mol­ecule with a large energy gap is described as hard while one having a small energy gap is known as a soft mol­ecule. Hard mol­ecules are not more polarizable than the soft ones because they require immense excitation energy (Karabacak & Yilan, 2012 ▸).

The mol­ecular electrostatic potential is related to the electron density and mol­ecular electrostatic potential (MESP) maps are very useful descriptors for understanding reactive sites for electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions as well as hydrogen-bonding inter­actions (Sebastian & Sundaraganesan, 2010 ▸; Luque et al., 2000 ▸). Different values of the electrostatic potential are represented by different colours: red represents regions of the most electronegative electrostatic potential, blue represents regions of the most positive electrostatic potential and green represents regions of zero potential. The potential increases in the following order: red < orange < yellow < green < blue. Herein, MEP was calculated at the DFT–B3LYP/6–311(d,p) level of theory that was used for optimization. The MESP map for the title mol­ecule is shown in Fig. 8 ▸ with a colour range from −0.053 (red) to 0.053 a.u. (blue). The most electrostatically positive region (blue colour) is located in the mol­ecular plane (N–bonded hydrogen atoms of toluic hydrazide), thus explaining N1—H1⋯O1i hydrogen bond observed in the crystal structure. The map clearly shows that the electron-rich (red) region is spread around the carbonyl oxygen atom whereas the hydrogen atom attached to nitro­gen is positively charged (blue).

Database survey   
A search of the Cambridge Structural Database (Version 5.39, last update November 2018; Groom et al., 2016 ▸) revealed closely related compounds that differ in the donor substit­uents: N′-(4-chloro­benzyl­idene)-2-hy­droxy­benzohydrazide (Zhang et al., 2009 ▸), (E)-N′-[(pyridin-2-yl)methyl­ene]benzo­hydrazide (Ramesh Babu et al., 2014 ▸), (E)-N′-(4-meth­oxy­benzyl­idene)pyridine-3-carbohydrazide dihydrate (Gov­indarasu et al., 2015 ▸), (E)-4-bromo-N′-(4-meth­oxy­benzyl­idene)benzo­hydrazide(Balasubramani et al., 2018 ▸), (E)-3-(1H-indol-2-yl)-1-(4-nitro­phen­yl)prop-2-en-1-one hemihydrate (Zaini et al., 2018 ▸); (E)-4-bromo-N′-(2,4-di­hydroxy­benzyl­idene)benzo­hydrazide and (E)-4-toluic-N′-(2,4-di­hydroxy­benzyl­idene)benzohydrazide (Arunagiri et al., 2018a
 ▸,b
 ▸). In our studies of analagous hydrazide dervatives (with Cl or Br replacing the methyl group of the title compound, we have observed similar types of Intramolecular S(6) and intermolecular N—H⋯O hydrogen bonds (between the amide hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen atoms).

Synthesis and crystallization   
The title compound was synthesized by the condensation of 4-toluic hydrazide and 2-bromo­benzaldehyde (Fig. 9 ▸). An ethanol solution (10ml) of 4-toluic hydrazide (0.25 mol) was mixed with ethanol solution of 2-bromo­benzaldehyde (10 ml, 0.25 mol) and the reaction mixture was heated at 323 K for half an hour with constant stirring before being was filtered and kept for crystallization. After a period of one week, brown block-shaped crystals of the title compound were obtained.

X-ray crystallography and refinement   
Crystal data, data collection and structure refinement details are summarized in Table 3 ▸. The hydrogen atom on N1 (H1) was located in a difference-Fourier map and freely refined. C-bound hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions (C—H = 0.93–0.96 Å) and refined as riding with U
iso(H) =1.2U
eq(C) or 1.5U
eq(C-meth­yl).

Special details
Geometry. All esds (except the esd in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes)
are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell esds are taken
into account individually in the estimation of esds in distances, angles
and torsion angles; correlations between esds in cell parameters are only
used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic)
treatment of cell esds is used for estimating esds involving l.s. planes.	
Refinement. Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and
goodness of fit S are based on F2, conventional R-factors R are based
on F, with F set to zero for negative F2. The threshold expression of
F2 > 2sigma(F2) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is
not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based
on F2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R-
factors based on ALL data will be even larger.
