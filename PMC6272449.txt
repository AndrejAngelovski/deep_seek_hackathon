==== Body
1. Introduction
1,2,3-Triazoles are an important class of heterocycles due to their wide range of applications as synthetic intermediates and pharmaceuticals [1,2,3,4]. Several therapeutically interesting 1,2,3-triazoles have been reported, including anti-HIV agents [5,6,7,8], antimicrobial compounds [9], β3-selective adrenergic receptor agonists [10], kinase inhibitors [11,12], other enzyme inhibitors [13,14], the β-lactam antibiotic tazobactam [15] and the cephalosporin cefatrizine [16].

1,3,4-Thiadiazole derivatives have attracted considerable interest owing to their wide spectra of biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, antituberculosis, antihepatitis B viral, antileishmanial, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, CNS depressant, anticancer, antioxidant, antidiabetic, molluscicidal, antihypertensive, diuretic, analgesic, antimicrobial, antitubercular, and anticonvulsant activities [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26].

Thiazoles can found in drug development for the treatment of allergies [27], hypertension [28], inflammation [29], schizophrenia [30], bacterial [31], HIV infections [32], hypnotics [33] and more recently for the treatment of pain [34], as fibrinogen receptor antagonists with antithrombotic activity [35] and as new inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase B [36].

The 1,2,4-triazolopyrimidines have also attracted growing interest due to their important pharmacological activities, such as antitumor potency, antimalarial, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal and macrophage activation [37,38,39,40,41,42]. In continuation of our ongoing work [43,44,45,46,47,48], we report herein the synthesis of some new thiadiazole, thiazole and pyrido[2,3-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidine derivatives containing 1,2,3-triazole moieties.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Chemistry
Treatment of 4-acetyl-5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole (1) [49] with methyl hydrazino-carbodithioate (2) in 2-propanol afforded methyl 2-(1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinecarbodithioate (3) (Scheme 1). Structure 3 was elucidated by elemental analysis, spectral analysis, and chemical transformation. Compound 3 when reacted with ethyl 2-chloro-2-(2-phenylhydrazono)acetate (4b) in ethanolic triethylamine at room temperature gave one isolated product formulated as ethyl 5-((1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-ethylidene)hydrazono)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-carboxylate (9b). Structure 9b was confirmed by elemental analysis, spectral data, and an alternative synthesis route. Thus, 2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-thiadiazole 8b [50] was reacted with 4-acetyl-5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole (1) in ethanol afforded a product identical to 9b in all aspects (m.p., mixed m.p., and spectra). In the light of the these results, the mechanism outlined in Scheme 1 seems to be the most plausible pathway for the formation of 9b from the reaction of the 3 with 4b. The reaction involves initial formation of thiohydrazonate 6, which undergoes intermolecular cyclization as soon as it is formed to yield the intermediate 7 or via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrileimine 5b [prepared in situ from 4b with triethylamine] to the C=S double bond of 3. The formation of 6 and 7 are similar to the reactions of hydrazonoyl chloride with 1-phenyl-1,4-dihydrotetrazole-5-thione [51] and 5-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2(3H)-thione [52]. Compound 7 was converted to 9 by elimination of methanthiol. Analogously, treatment of the appropriate 3 with each of 4a, 4c–g gave 2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-thiadiazoles 9b–g, respectively, in good yield (Scheme 1).

Reaction of 4-acetyl-5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole (1) with thiosemicarbazide (10) in ethanol afforded 2-(1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinecarbothioamide (11) in a good yield. The structure of 11 was elucidated via elemental analysis, spectral data and chemical transformation. Its 1H-NMR showed signals at δ 2.47 (s, 3H, CH3), 2.68 (s, 3H, CH3), 6.67 (s, br., 2H, NH2), 7.32–7.58 (m, 5H, ArH’s), 8.73 (s, br., 1H, NH). Compound 11 was reacted hydrazonoyl chloride 4a in ethanol under refluxed gave the corresponding 4-methyl-2-(2-(1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinyl)-5-(phenyldiazenyl)thiazole (12a) in quantitative yield (Scheme 2). Structure 12a was confirmed by elemental analysis, spectral data and alternative synthesis. Thus, 2-(2-(1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinyl)-4-phenyl-thiazole (14), which was prepared from reaction of 1 with 2-hydrazinyl-4-phenylthiazole (13) [53], was coupled with benzenediazonium chloride in ethanolic sodium acetate at 0–5 °C to afford a product identical in all respects (mp, mixed mp, and spectra) to 12a. Analogously, treatment of 11 with the appropriate 4 gave thiazole derivatives12b–i, respectively, in good yield (Scheme 2).

Next, 1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-en-1-one (15) [54] was reacted with 6-amino-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydropyrimidin-4(1H)-one (16) in ethanol to afford 7-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-5-phenyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(1H)-one (17) in a good yield. Structure 17 was elucidated by elemental analysis, spectral data and chemical transformation. Thus, when compound 17 was reacted with 4a in chloroform under reflux it afforded one isolable product, as evidenced by tlc, formulated as 3-acetyl-8-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-1,6-diphenylpyrido[2,3-d][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidin-5(1H)-one (22a, Scheme 3). The mechanism outlined in Scheme 3 seems to be the most plausible pathway for the formation of 22 from the reaction of thione 17 with 4 via two pathways: (1) 1,3-addition of the thiol tautomer 18 to the nitrilium imide 5 to give the thiohydrazonate ester 19 which undergoes nucleophilic cyclization to yield spiro compounds 20. The latter ring opened and cyclized to yield 22 by loss of hydrogen sulfide; and (2) 1,3-cycloaddition of nitrilium imide 5 to the C=S double bond of 17 to give 20 directly (Scheme 3). Attempts to isolate the thiohydrazonate ester 19, spiro intermediate 20 and thiohydrazide 21 did not succeed, even under mild conditions as they readily undergo in situ cyclization followed by elimination of hydrogen sulfide to give the final product 22 in Scheme 3.

2.2. Cytotoxic Activity
Our literature survey showed that many thiazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives have antitumor activity with excellent IG50 and IC50 values, as depicted in Figure 1 [55,56,57,58]. In view of these facts, we examined the antitumor activity of a new series of substituted thiadiazoles and thiazoles against the human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7) and against the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2).

The in vitro growth inhibitory activity of the synthesized compounds was investigated in comparison with the well-known anticancer standard drug doxorubicin using a crystal violet colorimetric viability assay. Data generated were used to plot a dose response curve of which the concentration of test compounds required to kill 50% of the cell population (IC50) was determined. The cytotoxic activity was expressed as the mean IC50 of three independent experiments (Table 1) and the results revealed that all the tested compounds showed inhibitory activity to the tumor cell lines in a concentration dependent manner. The small values of IC50 for the selected compounds indicate that, for more anticancer effect higher concentrations can be used. The results are represented in Table 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show that:
- The in vitro inhibitory activities of tested compounds against the human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) have the following descending order: 12a > 9c > 9b > 9g > 12e > 9d > 12b > 9e > 9a > 22d > 9f > 22a.

- The in vitro inhibitory activities of tested compounds against the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line have the following descending order: 12a > 9b > 9g > 9d > 9c > 9e > 9a > 12e > 22d > 12b > 9f > 22a.

3.2. Evaluation of the Antitumor Activity Using Viability Assay
Human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were grown on RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum and 50 µg/mL gentamycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and were subcultured two to three times a week.

Potential cytotoxicity of the compounds was evaluated on tumor cells using the method of Gangadevi and Muthumary [66]. The cells were grown as monolayers in growth RPMI-1640. The monolayers of 104 cells adhered at the bottom of the wells in a 96-well microtiter plate incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The mono layers were then washed with sterile phosphate buffered saline (0.01 M, pH 7.2) and simultaneously the cells were treated with 100 µL from different dilutions of tested sample in fresh maintenance medium and incubated at 37 °C. A control of untreated cells was made in the absence of tested sample. Positive control containing doxroubcin drug was also tested as reference drug for comparison. Six wells were used for each concentration of the test sample. Every 24 h the observation under the inverted microscope was made. The number of the surviving cells was determined by staining the cells with crystal violet [66,67] followed by cell lysing using 33% glacial acetic acid and reading the absorbance at 590 nm using a microplate reader (SunRise, TECAN, Inc, Männedorf, Switzerland) after mixing well. The absorbance values from untreated cells were considered as 100% proliferation. The number of viable cells was determined using the microplate reader as previously mentioned and the percentage of viability was calculated as [1 − (ODt/ODc)] × 100%, where ODt is the mean optical density of wells treated with the tested sample and ODc is the mean optical density of untreated cells. The relation between surviving cells and drug concentration is plotted to get the survival curve of each tumor cell line after treatment with the specified compound. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), the concentration required to cause toxic effects in 50% of intact cells, was estimated from the graphic plots.

4. Conclusions
Some newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-cancer activity against the human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. Also, their structure activity (SAR) was studied. The results revealed that the thiazole derivative 12a has promising antitumor activities (IC50 = 3.41 and 1.12 µM, respectively) and most of the tested compounds showed moderate anti-cancer activities.

Sample Availability: Samples of the synthesized compounds are available from the authors.
