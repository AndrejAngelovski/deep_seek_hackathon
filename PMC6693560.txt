Background
The last comprehensive systematic review of the incidence of psychotic disorders was published in 2004. New epidemiological data from different settings now permit a broader understanding of global variation. We examined the variation in psychosis by demographic characteristics and study method.

Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and bibliographies, and directly contacted first authors. We sought to obtain citations of original research published between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2017, on incidence of non-organic adult-onset psychotic disorder. We included papers that were published or in grey literature and had no language restrictions. Data were extracted from published reports, where possible, by sex, age, and ethnic group. Quality of yield was assessed. Data were assessed using univariable random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression. We registered our systematic review on PROSPERO, number CRD42018086800.

Findings
From 56 721 records identified, 177 met inclusion criteria. The pooled incidence of all psychotic disorders was 26·6 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 22·0–31·7). Heterogeneity was high (I2≥98·5%). Men were at higher risk of all psychotic disorders (incidence rate ratio 1·44 [1·27–1·62]) and non-affective disorders (1·60 [1·44–1·77]) than women, but not affective psychotic disorders (0·87 [0·75–1·00]). Ethnic minorities were also at excess risk of all psychotic disorders (1·75 [1·53–2·00]), including non-affective disorders (1·71 [1·40–2·09]). Meta-regression revealed that population registers reported higher rates of non-affective disorders (9·64 [2·72–31·82]), schizophrenia (2·51 [1·24–5·21]), and bipolar disorder (4·53 [2·41–8·51]) than first contact study designs.

Interpretation
We found marked variation in incidence of psychotic disorders by personal characteristics and place. Some geographical variation could be partially explained by differences in case ascertainment methods.

Funding
None.

Introduction
Psychotic disorders are associated with substantial premature mortality,1, 2 morbidity,3 and a large social and financial burden.4 Yet, research into their distribution and determinants has only in the past decade extended beyond North America5 and northern Europe6, 7, 8 to southern Europe,9, 10, 11, 12 South America,13 Africa,14, 15 and other low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).15, 16 These new data might provide new clues to the determinants of the heterogeneity in the incidence of psychotic disorders between and within different populations reported in previous studies,17, 18 aiding both service planning and our understanding of cause; both are crucial for planning effective public mental health responses. The most recent comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis17 was published in 2004 and was restricted to schizophrenia. Further meta-analyses have limitations in terms of single country coverage,18 search scope, yield and assessment of heterogeneity,19 specific population group coverage20, 21 or coverage of a particular risk factor,22, 23, 24, 25, 26 or were also restricted to schizophrenia.27

Together, these reviews showed that estimates of the incidence of psychotic disorders vary across replicable demographic, geographical, and social characteristics. Men and young people appear to have an excess risk,27, 28 as do migrants and their descendants.20, 29, 30 Settings at higher latitude and more urban settings also yield higher incidences.26, 31 Socioeconomic deprivation, inequality, and instability are also associated with increased incidence.14, 32, 33, 34 Earlier meta-analyses17, 18, 35 found no evidence of variation in incidence by study quality or other methodological features. Research suggests36, 37 that higher incidences are derived from population registers (which cover all health-care contacts within an entire health system) than from first-contact studies (which rely on individuals making contact with appropriate services). These comparisons notwithstanding, methodological heterogeneity as an explanation for variation in incidences has not been investigated widely.

We sought to synthesise the accumulating research on the incidence of adult-onset psychotic disorders (including affective psychotic disorders) and investigate whether sociodemographic factors or methodological heterogeneity accounted for any observed variation. Consistent with available evidence, we hypothesised that incidences would be higher in men, younger people, and those from ethnic minority groups, and in register-based studies.

Research in context
Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed and Web of Science (appendix p 4) for international systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the incidence of non-organic psychotic disorders in the general population, published since the last major review of the evidence (published in 2004). Our search yielded 156 results, of which 14 were meta-analyses. However, these commonly examined a single risk factor for psychotic disorders, such as migrant status, or synthesised evidence of incidence in a particular segment of the population, such as the elderly. Only one meta-analysis met all inclusion criteria and summarised incidence in the general population, but this study provided no assessment of heterogeneity.

Added value of this study

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the incidence of non-organic adult-onset psychotic disorders done in 16 years and provides an update on the epidemiological landscape. For the first time, we also formally assessed if incidence of psychotic disorders varies by study type. Incidence varied substantially between settings: a 10 times variation in incidence was observed across diagnostic categories. We also found that studies with routine registers reported higher incidences of disorder than studies with a service-based design.

Implications of all the available evidence

Variance in the incidence of psychotic disorders worldwide arises from both replicable social, demographic, and environmental determinants, and from methodological heterogeneity. Although most studies continue to be done in a handful of countries, future studies across more diverse settings will benefit from standardised methods to facilitate comparable estimates of incidence across the globe.



Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA guidelines38 (appendix pp 2–3), including preregistering our protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42018086800) before extraction of data. Our method is based on a previous systematic review.18

We systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase, adapting a previously used search strategy18 based on Cochrane Systematic Reviewing guidelines.39 This strategy used terms covering psychotic disorders and incidence and was adapted for each database (appendix p 4). We searched bibliographies of included citations and directly contacted authors to request data, where appropriate. We restricted our review to studies published between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2017. We had no restriction on language of publication, study design, or publication status, although grey literature was only identified via published conference proceedings, author correspondence, and bibliographical searches.

Citations were considered eligible if they contained incidence data or data from which incidence could be derived (numerator and denominator); included patients (aged 18–64 years) diagnosed with a first episode of any psychotic disorder; were published between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2017, and were published in the scientific or grey literature, online, or in print.

Two authors (HEJ, CT) carried out searches and screened the titles found to assess whether they met eligibility criteria, with definite or possible titles forwarded to duplicate independent abstract review and, if appropriate, full text review. Uncertainties about inclusion were resolved in agreement with two senior authors with experience in epidemiological research and systematic reviewing (JBK, PBJ). The study protocol is available online.

Data analysis
Two authors (HEJ, CT) extracted data. Study-level data about study characteristics, rate-level data about incidences, and meta-level data on time period, study quality, study design, and diagnostic criteria (see below) were included.

The primary outcome was incidence per 100 000 person-years of all psychotic disorders (International Classification of Disease tenth edition [ICD-10] = equivalent, F20–33), non-affective disorders (F20–29), schizophrenia (F20), affective disorders (F30–33), bipolar disorder with psychosis (F30–31), psychotic depression (F32–33), or substance-induced psychosis (F1X.5). Included studies used a range of diagnostic classifications, including ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD–10, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM) versions 3-R and 4, and we assumed sufficient commonalities to pool citations (appendix p 5).

Where possible, we extracted summary-level incidence data on the exposures age, sex, ethnicity, and migrant status. Meta-level data on study design, study quality, and time period were recorded. Study design was divided into first-contact studies (which count the number of people attending the relevant service, and include first presentation, first diagnosis, first GP record, first admission, and first treatment), cohort studies, case-register studies (with a dedicated national patient register), and studies with a general population register covering an entire health system. Time period was defined as the median year of the case ascertainment period. Where incidences were not directly reported, we derived them from ancillary information wherever possible. Where citations reported overlapping data from the same study or population, we used set criteria to establish inclusion (appendix p 4).

The full spreadsheet containing all study-level, rate-level, and meta-level data is available online.

Two independent raters (HEJ, JBK or CT) assessed study quality according to seven previously published criteria:18 designation of a defined catchment area, accurate reporting and reliable source of denominator data, population-based case finding, standardised research diagnosis used, masking (of the clinician) to demographic variables, inclusion criteria stated, and inclusion of a leakage study (appendix p 4).

We first did a narrative synthesis of the yield. Based on previous meta-analyses,17, 18 we anticipated high levels of heterogeneity and therefore specified use of random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression a priori to quantify this heterogeneity. When five or more incidences could be pooled, we did random-effects meta-analyses using the DerSimonian and Laird method,40 grouping citations by study design. We transformed incidence rates to their natural logarithm and entered into meta-analyses with corresponding standard errors (SE)s. If no SE could be derived, we retained studies for narrative synthesis only. For assessments of differences in incidence by sex and ethnicity, we estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs), transformed them to their natural logarithm, and entered them into meta-analyses with their corresponding SEs.

We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the Q test and quantified using the I2 statistic, which identifies the proportion of the observed variance that reflects real differences in effect size. We examined evidence of small study effects (including publication bias) by visual inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using Egger's test for which at least 10 estimates were available.41 We did random-effects meta-regression to explore whether heterogeneity was associated with study quality, study design, or time period.

We did meta-analyses in Stata (version 13)42 using the metan and admetan commands. We did meta-regressions using the metareg package, and we did funnel plots and Egger's tests using the metafunnel and metabias packages.

We chose to display pooled estimates to prevent ad-hoc summaries of data but considering the high expected heterogeneity, the emphasis in interpretation of results is on the variation in incidences.

Results
We retrieved 56 721 records of which 177 met inclusion criteria (figure 1; table); 93 (53%) of 177 had sufficient data available for meta-analysis and meta-regression. Most studies (140 [79%] of 177) were done in Europe, with 14 (8%) done in North America. Few studies were done in Asia (11 [6%]), the Middle East (seven [4%]), Australia, Latin or South America (four [2%] each), or Africa (two [1%]). Two citations covered more than one continent.15, 55 Citations examining psychosis in young people (26 [15%]), comorbid groups (12 [7%]), the army (seven [4%]), a prison population (one [<1%]), and post-partum psychosis (five [3%]) are synthesised in the appendix (pp 8–12) because they are not representative of the general population. The most frequently studied diagnostic outcome was schizophrenia (86 [49%]), followed by all non-affective disorders (66 [37%]) and all psychotic disorders (59 [33%]). Any affective psychotic disorder as an outcome was less frequently studied (32 [18%]), although we identified 40 (22%) citations of bipolar disorder with psychosis and 15 (8%) citations of psychotic depression. Six (3%) citations examined substance-induced psychosis.Figure 1 PRISMA flowchart

The largest study in this Article48 included 69 690 cases, and the smallest study47 identified eight cases. The middle year of recruitment varied from 190844 to 2012,53 with most citations (105 [59%]) recruiting between approximately 1995 and 2006. Most studies reported a clearly defined catchment area (174 [98%]), clearly listed their inclusion criteria (166 [94%]), used accurate denominator data (157 [89%]), and employed population-based case-finding (135 [76%]). Few studies done used a standardised research diagnosis (50 [28%]), did a leakage study (28·5 [16%]), or used blinding to demographic variables (18 [10%]; appendix pp 6–8). 92 (52%) citations reflected first contact designs and 76 (43%) used a cohort, case, or population register. The remaining nine (5%) studies used a combination. 40 (23%) citations used a version of the DSM for diagnoses and 118 (67%) used a version of ICD. The remaining 19 (11%) used a combination, used a different diagnostic system, such as the Research Diagnostic Criteria, or it was not reported (three [2%]; table). To confirm clinical diagnoses, 21 (12%) citations used a structured interview instrument only, 19 (11%) reviewed medical records, 14 (8%) used a structured interview followed by consensus diagnosis, 13 (7%) used only an interview without specifying whether an instrument was used, ten (6%) used only a consensus or panel discussion, and five (2%) used a chart or clinical diagnoses. The remaining citations either relied solely on clinical diagnoses in registry data (85 [48%]), or information was not stated (ten [6%]; table).

We included 44 separate estimates of the incidence of all psychotic disorders derived from 27 citations, including estimates from multicentre studies (figure 2). Incidence varied around 15 times, from 6·3 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 4·5–8·8) in Santiago (Spain)55 to 90·0 (88·3–91·8) in the USA.54 The overall pooled incidence of all psychotic disorders was 26·6 per 100 000 person-years (22·0–31·7).Figure 2 Incidence of all psychotic disorders

Incidence of non-affective disorders was available from 47 incidences derived from 28 citations (figure 3). Incidence varied almost 30 times, from 5·2 per 100 000 years (95% CI 3·7–7·4) in Santiago55 to 148·4 (142·7–154·4) in Finland.53 The overall pooled incidence was 18·7 per 100 000 person-years (14·8–23·6), but this incidence was lower in first-contact studies at 17·4 (14·6–20·8) compared with population register studies (pooled incidence rate 90·9 [34·5–237·5]; figure 3). The incidence of schizophrenia was available from 36 incidences from 26 citations and varied from 2·7 per 100 000 person-years (1·4–5·3) in Cavan-Monaghan (Ireland)43 to 75·9 (74·4–77·5) in South Korea.52 Pooled incidence was lower in first contact studies (13·1 per 100 000 person-years [9·0–15·0]) than in population registers (32·8 [23·2–46·5]; figure 4).Figure 3 Incidence of non-affective disorders

We pooled 34 estimates of the incidence of affective psychotic disorders from 16 citations. Incidence varied from 0·9 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 0·4–2·2) in Santiago55 to 17·0 (10·8–26·6) in Lundby (Sweden).46 The overall pooled rate was 4·6 per 100 000 person-years (3·1–6·8; figure 5). 24 estimates of the incidence of bipolar disorder were included in a meta-analysis, derived from 15 citations. Incidence varied from 1·4 per 100 000 person-years (1·0–2·0) in Wales45 to 28·5 (28·0–29·1) in Sweden,49 and was higher in population registers (15·1 [10·2–22·3]) than first contact studies (3·6 [2·0–6·5]; figure 6). Insufficient citations were available to pool rates for other outcomes.Figure 5 Incidence of affective disorders

Pooled estimates of the incidence of all psychotic disorders were similar across high-income and LMICs (appendix pp 11–16), though heterogeneity was substantial in both sets of data; formal comparisons were hampered by insufficient studies in LMICs.

For all psychotic disorders, 26 estimates of IRRs in men compared with women were available from 10 citations, with a pooled IRR of 1·44 (95% CI 1·27–1·62). A similar pattern was observed for non-affective psychoses (1·60 [1·44–1·77]; derived from 27 estimates using 11 citations) and schizophrenia (1·70 [1·46–1·97]; derived from 11 estimates using 11 citations). No excess risk in men was found for affective disorders (IRR 0·87 [0·75–1·00]; p=0·07; derived from 20 estimates using six citations) or for psychotic bipolar disorder (0·90 [0·73–1·11]; derived from five estimates; appendix p 17). Insufficient citations were available to pool IRRs for other outcomes.

Migrants and their descendants were at excess risk of all psychotic disorders, non-affective disorders, and schizophrenia (insufficient citations were available to synthesise results for other diagnostic outcomes). When pooling all migrant groups to a binary majority or minority division, 22 estimates from seven citations were available to pool IRRs for all psychotic disorders (pooled IRR 1·75 [95% CI 1·53–2·00]). The pooled IRR for non-affective disorders was 1·71 (1·40–2·09), derived using 28 estimates from thirteen citations. The pooled IRR for schizophrenia was 1·41 (1·15–1·75), derived using six estimates (appendix p 18). Risk was not equitably distributed across ethnic minority groups (appendix pp 19–21).

We did not pool estimates by age group because of the large variety of age groups used. Nonetheless, we observed an overall pattern of higher incidence in younger age groups (appendix pp 22–24). For example, in the multinational EU-GEI study55 incidence of all first episode psychosis ranged from 44·2 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 42·2–46·2) in people aged 18–24 years to 5·5 (3·2–7·7) in people aged 60–64 years.55

We found some evidence that study design was associated with variation in incidence. Population registers had higher incidences of non-affective disorders (IRR 9·64 [2·72–31·82]), schizophrenia (2·54 [1·24–5·21]), and bipolar disorder (4·53 [2·41–8·51]) than first contact studies. Incidence of schizophrenia was also elevated in cohort studies (3·10 [1·12–8·53]) and case registers (3·12 [1·33–7·29]). Cohort studies (0·43 [0·20–0·93]) and population registers (0·42 [0·22–0·83]) recorded lower IRRs by minority status for non-affective disorders than first contact designs, but we found no differences by study design in IRRs for any other exposure or outcome association. We found little evidence that study quality and time period were associated with changes in incidence or IRR (appendix pp 25–28).

Heterogeneity was high across study outcomes (I2 ≥98·5%; Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Small study effects, as evidenced by Egger's test, were shown in the overall meta-analyses of incidences of all psychotic disorders (β −7·53 [SE 3·14]; p=0·021), non-affective disorders (–14·55 [2·46]; p<0·001), schizophrenia (–11·78 [5·52]; p=0·041), affective disorders (7·72 [1·60]; p<0·001), and bipolar disorder (–14·97 [2·78]; p<0·001). They were also found in analyses by sex for all psychotic disorders (2·16 [0·44]; p<0·001) and affective disorders (0·90 [0·24]; p=0·001), but not for other diagnostic outcomes or for analyses by ethnic group (appendix pp 29–32). Post-hoc sensitivity analyses supported some remaining small study effects within first contact designs (appendix p 32).

Discussion
Our systematic review identified 177 citations containing data on the incidence of psychotic disorders published since 2002. This yield is considerably higher than reported in another systematic review19 and was marked by substantial heterogeneity in incidence across all major psychotic disorders. Although we found no evidence that incidences varied with study quality or time period, we did observe strong evidence of higher incidence rates reported in register-based or cohort-based study designs than in first-contact studies. Given that register-based or cohort-based studies are often done with whole population samples (ie, the USA,51, 54 Sweden,49 Denmark,50 Taiwan48), this difference was consistent with our evidence of small study effects, whereby smaller studies tended to estimate lower incidence rates. Together with the high levels of statistical heterogeneity observed in our meta-analyses, our results suggest that methodological variation might partially obscure true heterogeneity in the incidence of psychotic disorders. Nonetheless, as previously established, we found strong evidence of higher incidences of all first episode psychosis and non-affective psychotic disorders in men and ethnic minority groups, with less evidence of such differences for affective psychotic disorders.

The strength of our study is that our search strategy was inclusive and based on a previously used strategy with good reliability.18 We searched multiple databases without restriction by place or language of publication. Although individual studies might have been missed, given the size of our yield we consider it unlikely that these missing data would have substantially altered our main conclusions.

One limitation of our Article was that some citations provided incidence estimates from multiple catchment areas (notably Jongsma and colleagues, 2018),55 which we included as separate estimates in meta-analyses. We acknowledge this inclusion might have conservatively biased SEs around effect sizes. Nonetheless, it would not have affected our observation of substantial interestimate heterogeneity in incidence, which was the primary focus of our Article. Future studies should consider adopting individual-participant data approaches, which account for clustering by design.56 We used a previously published, clinician-informed algorithm to group estimates into major psychotic disorder categories.18 However, for non-affective disorders particularly, the use of this algorithm led to the categorisation of studies that used several overlapping diagnostic outcomes (appendix pp 33–34), which might have contributed to heterogeneity. Although our quality assessment tool was based on epidemiological good practice, we acknowledge it might have been skewed towards first-contact studies given it is not feasible to assess some criteria (ie, blinding) in register-based designs. Despite this, our quality assessment aided in assessing the gaps in the published literature.

The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis of all psychotic disorders19 identified substantially fewer citations (N=33) than our Article and provided no assessment or investigation of heterogeneity, despite similar inclusion criteria and time frames. The estimates of our more comprehensive review are aligned: we found a pooled estimate of non-affective disorders of 18·7 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 14·8–23·7) and of affective disorders of 4·8 (3·3–6·9) compared with their estimates of 22·5 (16·5–28·5) for non-affective and 7·1 (1·4–12·2) for affective disorders.19 Our findings on the excess of psychoses in men were nuanced: the overall excess found in both reviews appears to be primarily driven by an excess in non-affective disorders in line with other meta-analytic evidence.27, 28

The median incidence of schizophrenia in our Article (21·7 per 100 000 person-years [IQR 5·6–52·0]) was higher than in the last major systematic review17 on this topic by McGrath and colleagues (15·2 [7·7–43·0]), with greater variation around these estimates. The only systematic review57 pertaining to mood disorders solely synthesised incidence of major depressive disorder and as such is not directly comparable to the present Article. The excess risk of (non-affective) psychotic disorders in migrants and their descendants is long-established,58 well-reported,20, 29 and covered elaborately in one publication.30

The present Article presents a varied epidemiological landscape, which partly appears to reflect methodological differences in study design. We found substantial heterogeneity both within and between study designs, with incidences of non-affective disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder higher in registry-based studies than in first contact studies. Different study designs were more common for different outcomes; for instance, a large proportion of schizophrenia studies were population registers, potentially contributing to this pooled estimate being higher than the pooled estimate of non-affective disorders (a broader category). Although individual studies36, 37 have done direct comparisons between different study designs, to our knowledge this study is the first systematic review to have investigated such differences. From a public mental health perspective, our results highlight the importance of parsing out potentially causally-relevant signals in geographical variance in incidence from noise generated through varying study designs used in different settings; individual studies16, 55, 59 that have done so suggest substantive variation in the global burden of psychotic disorders remains.

Nevertheless, more research is required to understand heterogeneity in incidence produced by different study designs. One possible explanation is that register-based studies primarily (though not exclusively) originate from Scandinavian countries, and higher incidences might indicate an association between latitude and psychotic disorders (which is well-reported, but poorly understood).31 Alternatively, although registry-based studies might ascertain new cases of psychotic disorder across an entire (usually secondary and tertiary) health-care system, not limited to contact with mental health providers, they also rely heavily on diagnoses made in clinical practice. Although such diagnoses are reliable,60 first-contact studies are often able to include standardised diagnostic assessments, which might reduce the number of false positives, leading to lower reported incidence. Small study effects are not necessarily due to publication bias41 and in our Article are consistent with the possibility of lower incidence rates reported in first contact designs; registry-based or insurance database-based studies tended to include a larger number of cases (table). However, sensitivity analyses (appendix p 32) suggest some within-type small study effects remained, which might reflect real variance between for instance urban (where a large number of cases accrue) and rural areas. In this Article, we were unable to assess effects of urbanicity, latitude, or other socioeconomic variables due to the preponderance of country-wide estimates for which no meaningful values could be assigned.

The geographical spread of studies in this Article remained mostly limited to Europe, Northern America, or Australia. One public health implication of our findings is the continued dearth of evidence outside of these settings, which might have profound consequences; for example, a cross-sectional study16 suggested the well established link between urbanicity and psychosis might not apply in LMICs. To fully understand and provide effective public mental health responses to the global burden of psychotic disorders, we will require methodologically-rigorous and culturally-appropriate epidemiological studies to delineate the incidence of psychotic disorders in a broader range of settings than has thus far been considered.

Finally, our findings also suggest that developing international guidelines for investigation of the incidence of psychotic disorders in different settings could help minimise methodological heterogeneity in the reporting of psychosis incidence across the globe.
