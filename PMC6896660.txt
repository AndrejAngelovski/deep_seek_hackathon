Introduction
During the last decade, the “traditional” drug panorama has been gradually “reshaped” and integrated, even though not totally replaced, by the appearance of “new/novel psychoactive substances” (NPS) which are either newly created or existing substances which are now being used in “novel” modalities (1–3). The clinical, toxicological, and psychopathological effects of NPS have not been completely investigated and discovered through modelling; hence, clinical and psychopathological/psychiatric concerns have arisen among clinicians/professionals working in dual diagnosis, drug addiction, and mental health area (1, 2, 4–6). The recent published report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) described more than 730 NPS notified to the agency by the end of 2018, with 55 new compounds reported for the first time in Europe only in 2018 (3). Of these, 51% were synthetic cannabinoids (SC), 24% synthetic cathinones/“bath salts,” 5% benzodiazepines, 2% synthetic opioids, and 18% other substances (i.e., tryptamines, phenethylamines, arylcyclohexylamines, psychostimulants, etc.) (3).

SC/“Spice drugs,” mainly marketed as nail polish remover, deodorizers, incense, and potpourri, labeled as “natural”/“legal” alternatives to cannabis, have been documented to be dramatically associated with extremely more severe adverse health effects compared to "classical" cannabis (1, 7). SC are mainly consumed by inhalation, typically smoked together with a dried herbal material onto which they are previously sprayed during the production phase with chemical additives, or by e-cigarettes, or sold in tablets, etc. (1, 7). SC are mainly sold and purchased in “smart-shops” and on online drug marketplaces (7). Among these adverse effects typically described are: cases of fatalities, cardiac dysrhythmias, seizures, liver toxicity, kidney failure, hypothermia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, rhabdomyolysis, nausea, vomiting, cognitive deficits, memory loss, sedation, catatonia, agitation, irritability, sympathomimetic syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accidents, hematuria, bloody noses, bleeding gums, internal hemorrhage, hemoptysis, panic attacks, anxiety, altered mental status, coma, and a peculiar “synthetic” psychosis, designated "Spiceophrenia" (1, 7). Moreover, animal studies demonstrated that the administration of SC to adolescent rodents or non-human primates may determine the onset of a schizophrenia-like phenotype in adulthood (8–11).

Being beta-keto-phenethylamines, synthetic cathinones (i.e., ethylone and methylone) are structurally similar to amphetamines [i.e., 3,4-methyl-enedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), methamphetamine, etc.] and catecholamines, with subtle differences which modify their chemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties (1). Some cathinones are analogues of pyrovalerone, e.g.,3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), naphyrone, 3, 4-methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinobutiophenone (MDPBP), and α-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (α-PVP) (12). Different synthetic cathinones may exert different effects and potency levels on the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotoninergic pathways, even though all usually own sympathomimetic and/or amphetamine-like effects (1). They are typically sold as pills, capsules, and powders, commonly insufflated (snorted/sniffed), orally consumed by “bombing” (swallowing the powder wrapped in a cigarette paper), mixed in a drink, or injected intravenously (13). Synthetic cathinones are generally known as “bath salts” in the USA and as “plant food” in Europe (1). Several motivations have been identified in their consumption and “appeal”/attractiveness among NPS and drug consumers, such as attaining feelings of euphoria/stimulation, increased energy, mood improvement, increasing empathy/openness, reaching a more mental clarity, experiencing vivid hallucinations, and increasing libido. Synthetic cathinone users seem to frequently report hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, seizures, as well cardiac, psychiatric, and other neurological signs, in addition to the onset of several levels of agitation, ranging from mild agitation to severe psychosis (14). Moreover, mood instability and paranoid ideation have been described among chronic users (15–17). Furthermore, most synthetic cathinone consumers described tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal syndrome (1).

The class of synthetic hallucinogens/psychedelics includes all substances able to alter consciousness (i.e., synthetic lysergamides, tryptamines, and phenethylamines) by distorting time/motion/color/sound perceptions of consumers and/or altering the perception of “self” and/or stimulating some sensory/perceptual disturbances (1, 18, 19). Hallucinogens are usually consumed orally, occasionally through small blotter paper portions (i.e., “tabs”) held in the mouth to allow absorption through the oral mucosa. Moreover, it has been reported as route of administration by insufflation, smoking, rectal, and injection (intravenous and intramuscular) (1, 18, 19). The route of administration may influence the effects, their onset, and duration (1, 18, 19). Hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, dizziness, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, xerostomia, sweating, impulsiveness, fast and labile emotional modifications (from fear, anxiety to euphoria), numbness, weakness, and tremors have been reported as frequent short-term effects. While long-term effects may comprise persistent psychosis (i.e., visual disturbances, disorganized thinking, and paranoia), mood fluctuations, and/or onset of a hallucinogen-persisting perception disorder (HPPD) (1, 5, 19).

Synthetic/novel psychostimulants comprise several NPS classes, i.e., piperazines (compounds labeled as “legal” alternatives to ecstasy, mainly identified as cutting agents in some ecstasy pills) and “amphetamine-type stimulants” (ATS) (1, 3). ATS, e.g., PMA (4-methoxyamphetamine/“Dr. Death”), PMMA (4-methoxymeth-amphetamine), 4-MTA (4-methylthioamphetamine/“flatliners”), DMA (2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine), aminorex derivatives (4,4″-DMAR); diclofensine, methiopropamine, etc., have been marketed as para-substituted methoxy drugs pharmacologically and clinically comparable to amphetamines (1, 3, 18). ATS are commonly supplied as tablets/crystals/powder, sometimes mixed with other substances (20). They are usually swallowed/smoked/snorted, and their common “street names” include “crystal meth” (aka “ice”)/“speed"/“crystal,” etc. (20). Obsessive delusions, paranoia, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and psychotic symptoms have been commonly reported following intake of ATS (20, 21).

Overall, NPS have been largely associated with several clinical and psychiatric symptomatology which may vary from the occurrence of an acute transient psychotic episode to more complex psychopathological patterns, depending on the substance implicated (and its pharmacological profile), the frequency, intensity and route of administration, and vulnerability and individual characteristics of NPS consumers (1, 4–6, 22, 24) (as shown in 
Table 1
). The psychopathological pattern of NPS-induced “new/synthetic psychoses” appears to be extremely different from the classical presentation, by introducing a new interesting field of research from a psychopathological and phenomenological point of view. More specifically, NPS mainly implicated in the onset of psychotic patterns are represented by SC, synthetic cathinones, psychostimulants, and some psychedelics/hallucinogenic NPS (1, 6, 19). However, as synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones are the most representative NPS groups, the present review mainly focused on these two categories in collecting, analyzing, and critically discussing data so far published about NPS-induced synthetic/chemical psychoses by underlining differences with “classical” psychosis.

Table 1 Pharmacological and clinical features of the main NPS classes.

Type of NPS category	Description	Neurotransmitter/pathways/receptors implicated	Clinical manifestations	
Psychostimulants	This category includes all compounds derived from psychostimulants (i.e., amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, and cocaine). Some synthetic psychostimulants include the biochemical family of synthetic cathinones (see below) and novel stimulants, aminorex derivatives, ATS such as diclofensine, methiopropamine, 4,4′-DMAR, NBOMe-series, 2C-series, etc.	Traditionally, psychostimulants primarily target monoaminergic systems, leading to increased extracellular levels of SER, DA, and/or NA.	
Desired effects:

Euphoria

Social disinhibition

Extroversion

Increased energy

Appetite suppressant

“High”


	
			
Untoward effects:

Serotoninergic syndrome

Psychosis

Paranoid ideation

Impulsivity

Mania

Agitation

Cardiovascular symptoms 

Hyperthermia

	
Synthetic cathinones ("bath salts")	This category includes analogues of naturally occurring cathinones such as Catha edulis (Khat). Synthetic cathinones are classified into: a) Substrates of DAT, SERT, and NAT (pharmacological profile similar to MDMA: i.e., butylone, ethylone, 4-MEC, etc.) b) Selective substrates of DAT (pharmacological profile similar to amphetamine and methamphetamine, i.e., methcathinone, flephedrone, etc.) c) Non-substrates of transporter inhibitors (i.e., MDPV, etc.) Some synthetic cathinones include mephedrone ("meow meow"), methedrone, methylone, 3-MMC, 2-MeOMC, 4-MeO-a-PVP, 4-MeO-PBP, 4-MeO-PV9, 4-MPD, 4F-PV8, 4F-PV9, 4F-PVP, a-PBT, a-PHP, a-PVT, dibutylone, DL-4662, Ethylone, MDPPP, MOPPP, NEB, Pentedrone, PV-8 (crystals), etc.	The mechanism by which synthetic cathinones exhibit an effect is similar to other stimulants through functionally changing monoamine transporters. They inhibit monoamine transporters, leading to increased extracellular levels of SER, DA, and NA. They exhibit a sympathomimetic activity.	
Desired effects:

Euphoria

Hypervigilance

Increased energy

Openness

Empathy

Increased libido

Appetite suppression


	
			
Untoward effects:
Excited delirium
Hallucinations
Agitation
Aggressiveness
Paranoid ideation
Exacerbation of mood disorders	
Synthetic cannabinoids (synthetic cannabimimetics, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists, "Spice drugs," "legal cannabis alternative")	A wide range of brands of herbal products containing synthetic cannabinoids have been available on the market. They include, but are not limited to, Spice, Black Mamba, Annihilation, and Amsterdam Gold. New brands continue to emerge. Brand names are sometimes reminiscent of street names of strains of cannabis. Synthetic cannabinoids may be classified into seven major structural groups:
naphthoyndoles (e.g. JWH-018, JWH-073, etc.);
naphthylmethylindoles;
naphthoylpyrroles;
naphthylmethylindenes phenylacetylindoles (i.e. benzoylindoles, e.g. JWH-250);
cyclohexylphenols (e.g. CP 47,497
homologues of CP 47,497)\
classical cannabinoids (e.g. HU-210).	They act on the endocannabinoid system, particularly on:
CB1 (total agonism)
CB2 (total agonism)	
Desired effects:

Relaxation

Analgesia

“High”

Sedation

Euphoria

Anxiolysis


	
			
Untoward effects:

Paranoid ideation

Brief psychotic episode

Persistent psychotic disorder/“Spiceophrenia”

Cognitive impairment

Anxiety/agitation

Dyscontrol of impulses

Dysphoria

Manic symptoms

Worsening of preexisting bipolar disorder and/or psychosis and/or schizophrenia

Seizures

Tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, dyspnea, tachypnea, nausea, vomiting

Stroke, encephalopathy, renal failure

Serotoninergic syndrome


	
Dissociatives	The compounds included in this category produce dissociative effects similar to phencyclidine (PCP or “angel dust”), ketamine (“Special K” or “K” or “Ket”), methoxetamine etc. Some of NPS included in this category comprise 3-MeO-PCP, ethylketamine, 3-HO-PCP, 4-MeO-PCP, Diphenidine, Methoxphenidine, etc.	Dissociative drugs act mainly as uncompetitive antagonists, through open channel blockade, of the glutamate ionotropic NMDA receptor. Dissociatives affect numerous other receptors (i.e., DA, opioid, 5-HT, adrenergic, nicotinic, muscarinic, and adenosine receptors) and ionic channels, leading to their occasional informal description of being neurochemically “dirty drugs.”	
Desired effects:

Dissociation/depersonalization (at high dosages)

Analgesia

“High” (at low dosages)

Euphoria (at low dosages)

“Out-of-body” or “near-death” experiences

Weightlessness


	
			
Untoward effects:

Headache

Psychosis

Reference ideation

Hallucinations

Flashbacks

Nausea

Dizziness

Paranoia

Anxiety

Cognitive impairment

Serotonergic syndrome (possible)


	
Hallucinogens (psychedelics/psychotomimetics/entheogens)	A category of substances developed as analogues of “classical” hallucinogens (i.e., LSD, psilocybin). They can be further divided into three subgroups:
Phenethylamines (e.g., mescaline, Bromo-DragonFLY, etc.)
Tryptamines (e.g., psilocybin, 5-MeO-DALT, etc.)
Lysergamines (e.g., LSD, AL-LAD, etc.) Novel tryptamines recently marketed include 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-DIPT, 4-HO-DALT, 5-MeO-AMT, DET, etc. Among the novel derivatives of “classical” psychedelic phenethylamines/MDMA-like drugs, we include the following: 2C-molecules (e.g., 2-CB/Nexus, 2C-I, 2C-E, etc.), PMA/Dr Death, Bromodragonfly/B-fly, 25C-NBOMe/N-bomb/Pandora, etc. Some hallucinogens also include herbs/plants such as Salvia divinorum, Mescaline, or other herb-related compounds previously used in traditional shamanic practices.	All three subgroups share a common mechanism on serotonergic system, represented by the agonism/partial agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor (activation), 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C. However, the different hallucinogenic/psychedelic drugs may differently interact with other neurotransmitters, i.e., NMDA receptors, σ-receptors, µ-opioid receptors, and muscarinic receptors, apart from causing serotonin and dopamine reuptake inhibition at their transporters.	
Desired effects:

Perceptual restructuralization

Oceanic boundlessness

Visual hallucinations

Alterations in sensory perception

Distortion in body image

Depersonalization

Entactogenic feelings

Euphoria


	
			
Untoward effects:


Anxiety

Agitation

Psychosis

Hallucinations

Serotonergic syndrome (possible)


	
Sedatives/analgesics	This category includes the synthetic/derivatives opioids (i.e., AH-7921, IC-26, MT-45, nortilidine, W15, W18, U-47700, lefetamine, etc.) and designer/synthetic benzodiazepines (i.e., etizolam, flubromazepam, flubromazolam, phenazepam, pyrazolam).	They may act on opioid system and/or GABA system.	
Desired effects:

Analgesia

Sedation

Emotional

	
			
Untoward effects:

Lack of consciousness

Somnolence/sedation

Respiratory depression

Coma and death

	
ATS, amphetamine-type stimulants; SER, serotonin; DA, dopamine; NA, noradrenalin; SERT, serotoninergic transporter; DAT, dopamine transporter; NAT, noradrenergic transporter; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate.

Material and Methods
Search Sources and Strategies
A mini-review was conducted by analyzing and collecting clinical data (only human studies) on cases of NPS-induced psychosis, by using PubMed/Medline and focusing on synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones. We combined the search strategy of free-text terms and exploded MESH headings for the topics of “Novel Psychoactive Substances” and “Synthetic/Chemical Psychoses” as follows: {(Novel Psychoactive Substances[Title/Abstract]) AND Psychosis[Title/Abstract])} and for each NPS category (synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones) as well, without time/language restrictions. All studies published up to 30 June 2019 were included. In addition, secondary searches were performed using the reference listing of all eligible as well as relevant articles and consultation with experts in the field and or manual searches.

Study Selection, Data Extraction, and Management
We considered studies evaluating the relationships between NPS and synthetic psychosis. We examined all titles and abstracts and obtained full texts of potentially relevant papers. Working independently and in duplicate, two reviewers (LO and SC) read the papers and determined whether they met inclusion criteria. Duplicate publications were excluded. All experimental and observational study designs, including case reports, case series and surveys, were retrieved. Narrative and systematic reviews, letters to the editor, and book chapters were excluded, even though they were used for retrieving further secondary searches. To be included in the present review, studies were required to meet the following criteria: a) empirical and peer-reviewed study; b) at least an abstract with estimates and/or full results published in English; c) human studies; and d) provide data on synthetic psychosis induced by NPS. LO and SC independently extracted the data on participant characteristics, intervention details, and outcome measures. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third member of the team (GDP). Data were collected using an ad hoc developed data extraction spreadsheet.

Characteristics of Included Studies
The set of keywords initially generated 402 results. A total of 123 papers were excluded because of duplication; seven papers were excluded through lack of an english abstract. Of the remaining 272 studies, 145 studies were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or because they were animal studies. Of the remaining 127 papers, 37 papers were excluded because they were reviews, letters to editors, or meta-analyses, while seven papers were not included here due to the lack of an available full text or an abstract useful for collecting relevant data. Finally, a total of 83 papers were included and accounted for in our analysis. 
Table 2
 clearly explains the main characteristics (study design, sample size, main outcomes, and findings) of all studies retrieved.

Results
Data on NPS-Induced Psychosis in General
A cross-sectional survey carried out as a retrospective review of electronic discharge letters of all patients discharged from general adult psychiatric wards in the Royal Edinburgh Hospital recruited 483 admissions, 86 of which had NPS involvement reported. Among NPS users, the diagnosis of drug-induced psychosis was significantly higher (p < .001, OR = 18.7) compared to non-NPS users (25). The European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN) collected data on presentations to emergency department (ED) with acute recreational drug and/or NPS intoxication in 16 sentinel centers in 10 European countries, reporting psychosis varying from 3% to 16.3% (26). A retrospective analysis of cases presenting to the ED of the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, with symptoms/signs consistent with acute toxicity of recreational and/or NPS use identified two intoxications with NPS: one with methylone and one with 2C-P; 71 cases of psychoses even though the authors do not clearly describe clinical presentation related to the NPS identified (27).

Data on Synthetic Cannabinoids
A case series described some instances of SC-induced reemergence of florid psychotic symptomatology among five forensic patients who took a mixture of SC (like “K2” and JWH-018) contained in “Aroma” blend (28). Psychopathological patterns comprised the onset of psychomotor agitation, disorganized behavior, and ideation, delusional beliefs (grandiose and paranoid) in previously stable patients with a personal history of severe mental illness (SMI) (28). No data are provided about pharmacotherapy and/or specific/suggested treatment (28).

Müller et al. (29) described a 25-year-old man, with a previous history of recurrent psychotic episodes triggered by cannabis consumption and stable on monotherapy with amisulpride (800 mg daily), who presented to hospital with increased levels of anxiety, feelings of manipulation, and psychotic symptoms after smoking “spice” drugs on three different occasions (3 g each). The subject reported the feeling of being controlled and manipulated through a chip which he thought was implanted in his abdomen several years before together with the onset of imperative voices and paranoid hallucinations, symptoms he never had before (29). no data are provided about pharmacotherapy and/or specific/suggested treatment (29).

Another case report described three cases of “Mojo psychosis,” a mixture of SC (30). No further details on psychopathological presentation have been reported by the authors (30).

A study evaluating urine metabolism of SC described three cases of new-onset psychosis following the intake of a mixture blend named “Tropical synergy” containing several SC (31). No further data are provided on psychopathological pattern and/or about pharmacotherapy and/or specific/suggested treatment (31).

Vearrier and Osterhoudt (32) described a case of an adolescent girl who arrived at the ED agitated, violent, and uncontrollable after inhaling a “K2.” She described a previous history of alcohol and cannabis intake. Her psychopathological pattern comprised the onset of visual hallucinations, anxiety, restlessness, tachycardia, higher blood pressure, muscle fasciculation, hypokalemia, and mydriasis. She was given lorazepam 2 mg intravenously, with a good remission (32).

Benford and Caplan (33) reported a case of a 20-year-old honor college student who presented to the ED with severe anxiety/paranoia and auditory/visual hallucinations after smoking “Spice” drugs. Psychopathological pattern comprised the onset of increasing levels of anxiety, paranoia, and both auditory and visual hallucinations. The subject refused voluntary psychiatric admission. No data are provided about pharmacotherapy and/or specific/suggested treatment (33).

A case series described 11 Hispanic adolescents admitted to the South Miami Hospital Addiction Treatment Center in Miami-Dade County, Florida, after smoking SC and developing a new-onset psychosis (34). Subjects reported using Spice drugs more than three times in their lifetime (8 out of 11 subjects), while 4 out of 11 reported smoking SC multiple times per day. Psychopathological patterns comprised mood fluctuations, altered cognition and perception (i.e., visual and auditory), memory difficulty, euphoria, sometimes irritability and anxiety, and paranoid thoughts (34). In addition, subjects reported tachycardia, restlessness, appetite changes, muscle fasciculation, tremors, and weakness. No data are provided about pharmacotherapy and/or specific/suggested treatment (34).

A cohort explorative study recruiting subjects from a Regional Forensic and Rehabilitation service in New Zealand reported a SC-induced psychotic recrudescence in 15 vulnerable individuals previously affected with SMI (35). The psychopathological patterns comprised the onset of psychomotor agitation, disorganized behavior, and ideation, delusions after smoking SC. All subjects reported a previous psychiatric history of psychotic disorder and had been compulsorily treated with therapeutic doses of antipsychotics (unspecified) and, in five cases, together with mood stabilizers (unspecified). No data are provided about pharmacotherapy and/or specific/suggested treatment following SC-induced psychosis (35).

Forrester et al. (36) retrospectively collected data on SC exposures referred to Texas Poison Centers in 2010 by identifying new-onset psychoses following SC intake. Psychopathological patterns comprised the onset of psychomotor agitation and hallucinations. In addition, tachycardia, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and multiple neurological symptoms were reported. No further information is provided regarding the psychopathology and phenomenology of SC-induced psychoses. No clear data are provided about specific/suggested treatment following SC-induced psychosis, intravenous fluids, benzodiazepines, oxygen, and antiemetics being reported, among the most commonly prescribed medications and, in around 3% of subjects, the use of sedatives and anticonvulsants (36).

Hurst et al. (37) described 10 cases of otherwise healthy men, admitted to the psychiatry ward at the San Diego Naval Medical Center between August and December 2010, who experienced a SC-induced new-onset psychosis. The psychopathological patterns were characterized by auditory and visual hallucinations, disorganized behavior and speech, suicidal ideation, alogia, insomnia, psychomotor agitation and/or retardation, and higher levels of anxiety. No clear data are provided about specific/suggested treatment following SC-induced psychosis, use of antipsychotics (unspecified) being reported in 10 patients (36).

A case report of a 23-year-old high-functioning Caucasian Navy corpsman who developed a SC-induced psychosis was reported by Johnson et al. (38). The psychopathological pattern comprised the onset of nonsensical speech, paranoia of being videotaped, disorganized behavior and speech, tangential thoughts, delusional ideation (i.e., the feeling of own “mind expanded” and the ability to “comprehend infinity,” and so on) without perceptual distortions.

Discussion
Overall, NPS use seems to exert stronger and more persistent and severe effects among subjects with SMI than in healthy subjects (i.e., without a previous psychiatric history), mostly due to activity in the dopaminergic system, implicated in managing behavior and thought processes and in determining psychosis, or in the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and/or glutamatergic systems (4, 108, 109) (as illustrated in 
Table 1
). NPS may exert severe dissociative states, confusion in previously psychotic patients, relapse or worsening of a preexisting psychosis, persistent worsening of psychotic symptoms course, or the onset of a new severe psychotic symptomatology among healthy subjects (110, 111). In fact, the emergence of a psychotic symptomatology is commonly associated with a plethora of neurotransmission changes, e.g., increased central dopamine levels, cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation, 5-HT2A receptor activation, decreased activity in N‐methyl‐‐aspartate receptors, and k‐opioid receptor activation. NPS may interfere at these neurobiological levels and facilitate the imbalance of several neurotransmitters and receptors (as illustrated in 
Table 1
). For this reason, NPS use may really determine severe psychiatric symptoms, also in individuals not previously affected by a mental disorder. It is still unclear how the frequency of use (continuous vs. discontinued), the intensity of consumption (low, medium, or heavy), and the dosages (low vs. high dosages) may or not influence the development of a specific psychopathological pattern. Therefore, the advent of NPS has posed further clinical concern as not only are their clinical, toxicological and safety profiles often completely unknown (1) but they may also cause the onset of new psychopathological entities or the reemergence of “forgotten” psychopathological patterns, such as HPPD (4, 5).

Furthermore, the subtle gap/bridge between a “classical” vs. a “synthetic” psychosis is still the subject of clinical concern, as it seems the psychopathological, phenomenological, and clinical features of these two entities remain completely undefinable and clear. Moreover, this “gap” may have also meaningful effects in the choice of the best treatment and in defining the best outcome(s) and prognosis.

In addition, even though generically classified as NPS, not all NPS possess the same pharmacological and clinical profiles; hence, from a psychopathological point of view, clinicians may observe several types of NPS-induced “synthetic psychoses,” depending on the substance involved. Similarly, a specific NPS may cause different psychopathological effects in vulnerable vs. non-vulnerable individuals (as shown in 
Table 2
). With regard to this, the model of a substance-related exogenous psychosis (SREP) and its toxic subtype (aka “lysergic psychoma”) may be helpful in shedding light to clinicians on differentiating classical/endogenous versus synthetic (NPS-induced) psychoses, from a clinical perspective. Unlike “classical/endogenous” psychosis, SREP is characterized by the following features: a) qualitative and quantitative consciousness alterations (i.e., crepuscular state and onyroid state); b) ego disorders (i.e., somatosensory/allopsychic); c) sensorial–perceptual disorders (i.e., visual, auditory, and coenesthetic); d) egodystonia (i.e., behaviors not coherent with self-image); e) mood swings; f) hyper-presentation of the time/“concrete” psychoses, i.e., alteration of the experienced space; g) modification of body perception; h) anhedonia/apathy/negative symptoms; and i) dyscontrol impulsivity and self-/hetero-aggressiveness (112) (as shown in 
Table 3
). “Lysergic psychoma” is a phenomenological construct characterized by the perception of an “extraneous/foreign” body in one’s own mind, in which the residual critical ego takes position against the intoxicated part of one’s own self (113). It is a syndrome characterized by a clear egodystonic experience in which a subject clearly feels and observes this “foreign entity” as an unusual experience, out of own control, accompanied by hallucinations (mainly visual and kinaesthetic) and delusional perceptions (and thoughts) which are completely resisted by the subject who tries to stem them (114). This psychotic experience is often described as self-limiting, intense, and brief and appears to spontaneously resolve after substance discontinuation, as also observed in several studies examined here (see 
Table 2
). However, chronic, persistent NPS use, mainly at high dosages, may cause a complex, persistent, and long-lasting psychopathological pattern, defined as “synthetic psychosis,” a paraphrenic syndrome due to a NPS-induced mental automatism which causes a psychotic trajectory (114). Furthermore, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacological profile of each NPS seem to be responsible for the psychopathological and clinical manifestation of each NPS-induced synthetic psychosis (as shown in 
Tables 1
, 
2
, and 
4
) (1, 19, 115–117). Although there is still a need to clearly discriminate and characterize specific psychopathological and pathognomonic patterns depending on the specific NPS classes involved, as previously stated and shown in 
Table 2
, an attempt had been made here to provide a critical summary of studies in order to describe some NPS-induced psychopathological clusters (
Table 4
).

Overall, after an acute or repeated consumption of SC, neurological toxidromes have been described, such as mental status changes, panic attacks, agitation, aggressiveness, memory distortions, depersonalization, dissociation, catatonia, recurrent psychotic episodes (e.g., delusional thoughts and paranoia), and auditory and/or visual hallucinations (1, 7, 96, 116–121). Psychosis developing in the context of a SC intake and/or intoxication is often described as endoformic (e.g., verbal hallucinations, kinesthetic automatisms, and delusion of grandeur or influence can be present), long-lasting (from 10–14 days to 4–6 weeks), and gradually self-resolve with the persistence of asthenic-depressive symptomatology and cognitive deterioration for more than 4–8 weeks (7, 38, 44, 87). However, several findings documented here show that SC-induced psychoses may persist even in those subjects without a previous history of mental illness and may induce the development of a schizophrenia-like symptomatology, named “Spiceophrenia” (7, 25, 111, 122–125). In addition, there is evidence of a worsening/recrudescence of a mental health disorder (i.e., mainly an affective and/or a psychotic disorder) in those subjects with a preexisting mental condition (29, 34, 35, 50, 56–59, 61, 67, 69, 80, 84, 85, 111, 122). Some studies reported that SC may influence psychiatric course and prognosis, depending on the first age of SC exposure, psychiatric vulnerability/predisposition, a history of a childhood trauma or other traumatic experiences, and specific genetic factors (67, 69, 124). Furthermore, SC have been supposed to determine a more severe psychosis, accompanied with agitation and significant sympathomimetic effects, compared to “classical” cannabis as SC are more potent full receptor agonists at cannabinoid receptors and do not contain cannabidiol, which possesses anxiolytic and antipsychotic properties (1, 7, 70, 126). Despite the evidence presented here, some authors maintain that it is difficult to clearly prove a causal linkage between SC intake and the onset of an ex novo psychosis in psychosis-prone/vulnerable subjects and/or the exacerbation of a prodromal psychotic syndrome/appearance of basic symptoms (127). From a therapeutic perspective, benzodiazepines are useful for managing anxiety, agitation, and seizure risk, together with a supportive/symptomatic therapy (1, 7, 30, 32, 36, 39, 41, 46, 48, 59–61, 71, 79, 81). Olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole represent the main prescribed antipsychotic treatments in SC-induced psychoses (1, 7, 37, 50, 57, 60, 62, 65–67, 70, 75, 85, 86), while haloperidol, risperidone, and paliperidone have been prescribed/used in isolated cases (45, 53, 63, 73, 85).

In contrast, published findings reported that synthetic cathinones may cause variable effects in patients with SMI, such as acute psychosis, agitation, violent behavior, confusion, disorientation, insomnia, suicidality, mood lability, and instability in patients affected with bipolar disorder and/or substance poly abuse, while tangential thought process, disorganized speech and behavior, paranoid delusions, and auditory and visual hallucinations are demonstrated in patients affected with schizophrenia, associated with amnesia surrounding their psychotic breaks (88, 90, 91, 93, 94, 96, 100–102, 104, 106, 128). Treatment should be single-minded on managing agitation and psychosis and in supporting renal perfusion. Sedation may be required if the patient is markedly agitated and at risk of self-harm or harm other patients or health professionals (1, 92, 95, 97, 98, 103, 104). In particular, benzodiazepines should be preferred to manage physical violence, to decrease tachycardia and blood hypertension, to prevent seizures, and to reduce muscle hyperactivity, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure (1). Use of antipsychotics alone should be considered as second-line strategy for managing agitation due to the higher risk in lowering seizure threshold and the higher risk in contributing to the acute toxicity of synthetic cathinones (1, 88, 97, 98, 106). Alternatively, anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers have been suggested (99).

The present review has several limitations which may restrict the generalizability of the findings presented here, e.g., most studies considered here have mainly focused on synthetic cannabinoids which represent the main representative NPS group, but do not necessarily represent all NPS-induced synthetic psychoses. In addition, most studies are represented by case reports, which, on the one hand, may represent a good tool/vehicle to provide more detailed psychopathological and clinical features on NPS consumption and NPS-induced psychosis, but it may not be greatly generalizable to a more representative clinical sample. Most studies do not report if NPS intake is acute or chronic and single or repeated, or do not clearly specify NPS dosage, route of administration, comorbid use of other substances, and so on. Furthermore, the present overview does not possess the scientific robustness of a systematic literature review as most studies are poorly comparable with heterogeneous outcomes and measures. Finally, from a therapeutic point of view, not all studies here considered provide data on therapeutic management and/or strategies. Moreover, those studies providing therapeutic management do not always report dosage(s) and/or treatment duration.

Conclusion
The constantly and rapidly developing NPS drug scenario represents a challenge for public health, especially so for the field of addiction and mental health. Indeed, NPS consumption is usually associated with an imbalance of a plethora of neurotransmitter pathways and brain receptors, and, hence, correlated to a huge repertory of psychopathological trajectories. Vulnerable individuals (e.g., children, adolescents, and subjects affected with a psychiatric disorder) may be more prone to develop and/or worsen a psychopathological condition, particularly a psychosis which may have peculiar features, from a psychopathological and phenomenological point of view. Due to a great range of medical and psychopathological disturbances associated with NPS intake, it is detrimental for mental health professionals not to be ignorant about the effects, safety, and toxicity profile of NPS so far known, especially the most widespread ones discussed here, e.g., SC and synthetic cathinones. Indeed, further researches should better investigate their clinical and pharmacological knowledge so that better personalized management and treatment strategies/guidelines can be written and disseminated.
