==== Body
In the article titled “Use of Aripiprazole Long Acting Injection in Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia” [1], there was an error in the Abstract as the patient was mistakenly described to be of “Afro-Caribbean origin” and once again as an “Afro-Caribbean female” in the “2. Case Presentation” section. The authors apologize for that mistake as the patient should be referred to as “a female of African descent”.
