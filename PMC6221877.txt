This Article contains errors in the Methods section under subheading ‘Data source and study population’.

“From the 2005–2013 claims data, we identified pregnant women who had the diagnosis of depression during pregnancy (ICD-9-CM codes of depression: 296.2, 296.20 to 296.25, 296.2, 296.30 to 296.35, 296.82, 300.4, 309.0, 309.1, 309.28, and 311). Only pregnant women with the depression diagnosis for at least 3 times in the outpatient records or for at least once depression diagnosis in the inpatient records were included in the depression cohort. Depressed women with the history of schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM 295), bipolar disorders (ICD-9-CM 296, 296.2, and 296.3) and/or anxiety (ICD-9-CM 300) were excluded.”
