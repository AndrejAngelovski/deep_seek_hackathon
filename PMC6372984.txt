been challenged by several findings. Here, an alternative molecular neurobiological
model is proposed. It is shown that the presence of the APOE ε4 allele, altered miRNA expression and epigenetic dysregulation
in the promoter region and exon 1 of TREM2, as
well as ANK1 hypermethylation and altered levels
of histone post-translational methylation leading to increased transcription of
TNFA, could variously explain increased levels
of peripheral and central inflammation found in AD. In particular, as a result of
increased activity of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2), the
presence of the apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) isoform, and changes in ANK1 expression, with subsequent changes in miR-486
leading to altered levels of protein kinase B (Akt), mechanistic (previously
mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) and signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3), all of which play major roles in microglial activation,
proliferation and survival, there is activation of microglia, leading to the
subsequent (further) production of cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide,
prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species, inducible nitric oxide synthase and
cyclooxygenase-2, and other mediators of inflammation and neurotoxicity. These
changes are associated with the development of amyloid and tau pathology,
mitochondrial dysfunction (including impaired activity of the electron transport
chain, depleted basal mitochondrial potential and oxidative damage to key
tricarboxylic acid enzymes), synaptic dysfunction, altered glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity, mTOR activation, impairment of autophagy, compromised
ubiquitin-proteasome system, iron dyshomeostasis, changes in APP translation, amyloid plaque formation, tau hyperphosphorylation
and neurofibrillary tangle formation.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, clinically heterogeneous,
age-sensitive neurodegenerative disease, characterised by often escalating
impairments of memory and other cognitive functions together with associated changes
in personality and behaviour [1–3].
Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are invariant pathological
hallmarks seen in the brains of people suffering from of AD [4]. These abnormalities are held to result from the
accumulation of small peptides known as amyloid beta (Aβ) in central nervous system
(CNS) tissues, and from gross changes in cytoskeletal organisation stemming from the
hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (ptau) in neurones
[5]. According to the classical
‘amyloid cascade’ model of disease causation, Aβ is overproduced following the
disruption of homeostatic mechanisms which normally regulate the proteolytic
cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In this model, age-related genetic
and environmental factors conspire to induce a metabolic shift favouring the
amyloidogenic processing of APP but inhibiting the physiological, secretory pathway
[6–8]. These processes
are represented in Figs. 1 and 2 and are well documented and hence will not be the
main focus of this paper.Fig. 1 The amyloid hypothesis. According to the current ‘amyloid cascade’
model of disease causation, Aβ overproduction stems from the disruption of
homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the proteolytic cleavage of APP under
physiological conditions. This model proposes that age-related, genetic,
epigenetic and environmental factors collude to provoke a metabolic shift
favouring the processing of APP by BACE1 and the intramembranous γ-secretase
complex composed in part by presenilin-1 or presenilin-2, while
simultaneously inhibiting the physiological, secretory pathway via
α-secretase, which releases soluble APPα which precludes generation of Aβ.
The net result is to enhance the production of the putatively neurotoxic
Aβ42 monomer at the expense of the putatively
neuroprotective Aβ40. The current version of the
amyloid hypothesis claims that Aβ42 accumulation into
soluble oligomers is the primary driver of neuropathology, although the data
allow for an independent or synergistic role for insoluble
fibrils

Fig. 2 Physiological and pathological APP processing. APP is processed
via two mutually exclusive pathways involving cleavage by β-secretase and
α-secretase. Cleavage by the latter enzyme intersects the β-amyloid region,
which eliminates the possibility of Aβ production and produces
membrane-bound C83 protein and sAPPα which enters the cytosol. Subsequent
processing of C83 by γ-secretase generates p3 and Aβ together with the
amino-terminal APP intracellular domain (AICD). APP cleavage by β-secretase
results in the production sAPPβ and C99. Further processing of C99 leads to
the production of the AICD fragment and Aβ which forms oligomers and
ultimately fibrils



The amyloid hypothesis has been under challenge in recent years as a
result of several findings. One is the failure of human trials using therapies
targeting the amyloid cascade; another is evidence obtained from positron emission
tomography neuroimaging demonstrating increased amyloid accumulation in cognitively
intact individuals and an absence of correlation between amyloid load and disease
severity in AD patients and in cognitively normal individuals [9, 10].

Hence, while the hypothesis proposing a causative role for Aβ
oligomers and ptau as the main, or at least initial, instigator of pathology in AD
at least in advanced disease probably holds primacy, there is a growing consensus
that the maintenance if not the origin of AD pathology is multifactorial, likely
with a high degree of inter-patient heterogeneity [11–14]. This is unsurprising as there is now an
extensive body of evidence showing that there are many potential drivers of
pathology in the brains of patients diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) which are evident in patients with MCI long before the development of amyloid
plaques or neurofibrillary tangles (reviewed by [15]). Chronic nitrosative and oxidative stress and significantly
depleted levels of reduced glutathione are invariant but non-specific findings, as
is the existence of impaired mitochondrial function along many dimensions
[16–19].

The presence of activated and dysfunctional microglia and reactive
astrogliosis would also seem to be an invariant finding in vivo both in AD and MCI
[20–22]. Other commonly
reported abnormalities include compromised autophagy and lysosomal clearance
accompanied by elevated activity of both glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and
mechanistic (previously mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR), coupled with a
defective ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) [12, 23–27]. Several authors have also reported abnormalities in the activity
of several kinases and phosphatases, most notably mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A or PP2), and transition metal
dyshomeostasis, which could all arguably play a role, either as primary or secondary
drivers of disease activity [11–13, 16, 28–30].

There is a growing consensus that iron dyshomeostasis plays a pivotal
pathological role in the illness, with increased levels of iron proposed as the
primary driver of neurodegeneration by many research teams [31–35]. Peripheral
immune abnormalities and inflammation are also being increasingly advocated as
major, albeit again non-specific, drivers of symptoms [36, 37]. Abnormalities in the composition of the microbiota, and
translocation of bacterial antigens into the systemic circulation and the brain,
have also become areas of intense research across the neurosciences [38, 39].

Impaired cerebral glucose metabolism is also invariantly reported in
AD patients and its occurrence precedes symptoms sometimes for years or even decades
[40]. Moreover, the progressive
increase in the levels and topography of glucose hypometabolism correlates with an
increase in symptom severity and synaptic dysfunction review [40]. In this context, the presence of insulin
resistance in AD is unsurprising (reviewed by [41]). This is also concordant with type 2 diabetes mellitus being a
risk factor for AD. These observations are of interest as they are common to both
disorders and could be explained by the presence of chronic inflammation, oxidative
stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the periphery and brain [42–45]. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are
also acknowledged causes of GSK-3 and mTOR upregulation and could also account for
Aβ upregulation (reviewed by [15]).
These observations rather invite the question as to whether increased peripheral
inflammation and oxidative stress could be a major driver of the abnormalities
repeatedly reported in AD patients. However, it should be noted that these
abnormalities have also been repeatedly reported in cognitively intact elderly
people as well as in diverse medical and neuropsychiatric disorders [46–54]; hence, there
must be other genetic and/or epigenetic factors involved.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed that
approximately 40% of AD patients carry the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and that APOE
ε4-positive, but cognitively intact, individuals over 50 years of age are
significantly more likely to have brain amyloid deposits than individuals free of
that polymorphism [55]; reviewed in
[56]. There is also evidence that,
compared with age- and sex-matched controls, AD patients carrying both the APOE ε4 allele and the H63D polymorphism of the
hemochromatosis protein-related class I-like major histocompatibility gene HFE are significantly more susceptible to earlier
development of AD than those carrying only one of these mutations [57]; reviewed by [58]. More recently, researchers have detected the rs75932628
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the triggering receptor expressed on
myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene, leading to an R47H
substitution, which increases the risk of developing AD in carriers by virtually the
same magnitude as the presence of one APOE ε4
allele [59]; reviewed by [60]. However, while genetics clearly plays a role
in AD susceptibility, the vast bulk of cases does not show strong genetic
underpinnings [61, 62]. Moreover, although common sequence variants
in several genes display robust associations with AD susceptibility, evidenced by
individual studies and subsequent meta-analyses, collectively, these SNPs only
account for approximately a third of attributable risk and the mechanisms
underpinning these associations remain undelineated [63]; reviewed by [64].

Recent epigenetic-wide association studies (EWASs) have revealed that
AD may be associated with decreased histone acetylation, increased histone
phosphorylation (probably including neuronal histone hyperphosphorylation) and DNA
hypermethylation with likely increased CpG methylation [62]. Moreover, several research teams have
independently reported strong associations between the epigenetic dysregulation of a
range of genes and the development of AD in entirely asymptomatic patients (reviewed
in [61]). Changes in the methylation
status of ANK-1 which encodes ankyrin repeat
domain-containing protein 1, which plays a role in linking integral membrane
proteins to the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton, display a particularly strong
association with AD development and the burden of neuropathology [65, 66].

Moreover, recent data implicating allele-specific changes to the
methylation status of the CpG islands (CGI) responsible for the transcription of
APOE and downstream genes in AD patients may
offer a better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the increased risk of
developing the disease in carriers of the APOE ε4
allele [67, 68]. This may also be the case for TREM2, as a recent meta-analysis concluded that increased
methylation of the TREM2 promoter region appears
to be an invariant feature in the brains of AD patients independently of age and sex
[64]. Moreover, this increase in
methylation correlates with a higher level of TREM-2 (triggering receptor expressed
on myeloid cells 2) activity in the brains of AD patients compared with healthy age-
and sex-matched controls [69]. It is
also noteworthy that, when viewed as a whole, the results of EWASs indicate that
epigenetic abnormalities in tandem with increased levels of inflammation greatly
exacerbate the risk of developing AD [61, 65, 66]. In the light of the above, this paper focuses
on three questions. First, can genetic and epigenetic factors explain increased
levels of peripheral and central inflammation and oxidative stress in AD? Second,
could this increased oxidative stress and inflammation originate in the periphery?
Third, can the initial development of elevated peripheral and central inflammation
and oxidative stress in the context of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities explain
the development of AD?

Evidence of Peripheral Inflammation and Immune Abnormalities in AD
Evidence of Peripheral Inflammation in AD
Two large meta-analyses have confirmed the presence of elevated
pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and other inflammatory molecules in the serum
and whole blood of AD patients. In the first of these studies, Swardfager and
fellow workers analysed the results of 40 studies and reported a higher
inflammatory status, evidenced by elevated levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-12,
tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β and IL-18, compared with age- and
sex-matched healthy controls [37].
These results have been confirmed in a more recent meta-analysis of 175 studies
involving 13,344 AD patients and 12,912 healthy controls conducted by Lai and
others [70]. These authors reported
elevated levels of TNF-α converting enzyme, soluble TNF receptors 1 and 2, IL-6,
IL-8, C-X-C motif chemokine-10, IL-2, α1-antichymotrypsin, high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein and homocysteine. This meta-analysis also revealed decreased
levels of leptin and IL-1 receptor antagonist in AD patients and it is noteworthy
that these authors concluded that IL-6 levels were inversely correlated with
cognitive scores as ascertained by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
[70]. The last finding is
unsurprising as there is a large body of evidence confirming that inflammatory
signals can have a severe adverse effect on brain function, and is consistent with
the work of several research teams which have reported that PIC levels in AD
patients are positively associated with cognitive decline, increased frequency and
severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms, disease severity and overall disease
progression [71–76].

It is also worth noting that the combination of PIC levels and
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures is more predictive of the
transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD than APOE genotype status alone [77, 78]. The weight
of data indicates that concentrations of TNF-α in particular appear to have a
clear effect on disease progression and/or severity. For example, Holmes and
fellow workers reported that a twofold increase in serum TNF-α levels over a
6-month period, indexing successive inflammatory insults, was associated with a
twofold rate of cognitive decline over the same period [72]. Furthermore, high baseline levels of the
cytokine were associated with a fourfold decline in cognitive function while
patients with population-normal levels of TNF-α experienced no cognitive decline
over the course of the study [72].
These results were broadly replicated in a later study conducted by the same
research team, who reported that TNF-α and IL-6 levels correlated with an
increased frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms characteristic of
pathogen-induced sickness behaviour [75]. Finally, a more recent study established a relationship
between elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and interferon gamma (IFNγ), produced by
abnormally activated T cells, and disease severity [76].

Evidence of Peripheral Immune Abnormalities in AD
Several research teams have reported abnormalities in CD4 and CD8 T
cell activation, differentiation, trafficking and receptor expression in patients
with MCI and AD compared with age- and sex-matched controls, although the results
reported by different research teams vary [36, 79]; reviewed in
[80]. The weight of evidence
indicates that CD4 T cells are activated and highly differentiated in AD patients
as indicated by a reduction in naïve and central memory
CD4+ T cells, an increase in Th17 T cells and a
reduction in regulatory T cells (Tregs) [34, 81, 82]. In addition, the pattern of receptor
distribution on the surface of CD4 T cells may also differ between AD patients and
age- and sex-matched controls, with an increased number of
CD4+ CD28− cells being
reported [34]. There is some evidence
that the pattern of CD4 T cell activity may be different in patients with MCI
compared with AD in whom Treg activity appears to be increased possibly in an
attempt to combat increasing inflammation [35].

The data regarding various aspects of CD8 T cell abnormalities in
AD patients are mixed and often conflicting with increased numbers and activity,
decreased numbers and activity and no changes compared with age- and sex-matched
controls all being reported [34,
36, 83]. However, several authors have suggested that these
inconsistencies could potentially be explained by the different methods used and
differences in compartments sampled [80].

The pathogenic significance, if any, of these T cell abnormalities
is still a matter of debate but there is a growing body of evidence that the entry
of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells into the CNS and dysfunctional ‘cross talk’
between the CNS and the peripheral immune system make a significant contribution
to the genesis and/or exacerbation of pathology in at least some patients with AD
[84, 85]. In this context, it is noteworthy that several research
teams have reported the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the brains of AD
patients post mortem (reviewed by [86]) and a recent study has reported a significant correlation
between the extent of CD8 T cell activation and parahippocampal microstructural
tissue damage in AD patients [83].
Moreover, this last team of authors reported that levels of activated
HLA-DR-positive CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells were significantly increased in the
peripheral blood of AD and MCI patients compared with age- and sex-matched
controls, but not in patients with a range of non-AD dementias [83]. This finding is consistent with that of
other published research which indicates that the pattern of T cell abnormalities
seen in AD may well be specific to the disease [87, 88].

Potential Origins of Peripheral Inflammation and Immune Activation in
AD
The Presence of Serum Aβ Autoantibodies
The origin of the chronic peripheral activation and activated but
dysregulated immune system seen in AD patients has not been delineated, but the
presence of autoantibodies directed at Aβ in the serum of AD patients, possibly
as a result of efflux from the brain, should be considered as certain classes of
antibody are well-documented inflammatory mediators [36]. The evidence regarding the existence of
increased levels of these antibodies in AD patients compared with age- and
sex-matched controls is unconvincing, however, with elevated levels, reduced
levels and no significant differences being reported (reviewed by [89]). It is also worthy of note that the
levels of B cells producing autoantibodies against Aβ appear to be the same in
AD patients and healthy controls [90, 91]. Moreover,
thus far, all available evidence demonstrates that these autoantibodies (both
IgM and IgG) are catalytic in nature, meaning that they rarely form stable
complexes and are not recognised sources of inflammation [92, 93]. The lack of association between serum Aβ autoantibody
levels and Aβ levels in the brain reported by Xu and others is also relevant as
this finding casts doubt on the origin of serum Aβ [91]. The lack of T cell responses to Aβ in AD
patients reported by Baril and colleagues is also pertinent; this finding
renders the hypothesis that antibodies to Aβ in the serum of AD patients are the
cause of T cell activation and differentiation patterns in such patients
improbable, although it cannot be ruled out [94].

Dysbiosis and Translocation of Commensal Lipopolysaccharide
Another possible cause could stem from disturbances in the
composition of the microbiota and translocation of commensal LPS into the
peripheral circulation, which have both been recently reported in AD, although
this again is a very non-specific finding [38, 39]. The
inflammatory consequences of this latter phenomenon, achieved via activation of
toll-like receptors on the surfaces of macrophages and dendritic cells and the
subsequent production of PICs, are well documented and hence bacterial
translocation as a consequence of increased intestinal permeability could go
some way to explaining chronic systemic inflammation in AD (reviewed by
[95, 96]).

Increased levels of translocated LPS can also have profound
effects on T cell activation, differentiation and trafficking, and thus could
potentially explain at least some of the peripheral T cell abnormalities seen in
AD patients. For example, LPS activation of antigen-presentation cells (APCs)
via TRIF (TIR (toll/IL-1 receptor) domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFNβ)- and
MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88)-dependent signalling
pathways initiates CD4 T helper cell clonal expansion and differentiation
[97]. The effect of LPS exposure
on CD4 T cell differentiation appears to be tissue dependent as evidenced by
reports of Th1 cell differentiation being induced by the presence of LPS in
lymphoid tissue and Th17 cell differentiation being the result of naïve CD4 T
cell exposure to LPS in the intestinal lamina propria [97]. LPS also affects T cell differentiation
indirectly by stimulating B cells via a mechanism involving toll-like receptor-4
(TLR-4) and B cell-activating factor belonging to TNF superfamily (BAFF)
activation, which results in naïve CD4 T cell differentiation towards a Th2 or
Treg lineage depending on localised levels of that commensal antigen
[98]; reviewed in [99]. Finally, it has been suggested that
activation of TLR-4 receptors on CD4 T cells by LPS may predispose to the
development of autoimmunity as such activation appears to increase the
proliferation and inflammatory status and survival of Th1 and Th17 cells
[100].

Translocated LPS would also appear to exert a range of effects on
CD8+ T cell activation, differentiation, survival
and trafficking. For example, Cui and fellow workers reported increased
proliferation and survival of memory CD8+ T
lymphocytes in an environment of high LPS, while McAleer and others reported
increased CD8+ T cell trafficking into non-lymphoid
tissue under similar conditions [101, 102]. The
surface TLR-4 receptors are directly sensitive to the presence of LPS and thus
evidence demonstrating their activation in an environment of high LPS, as
characterised by elevated levels of CD25 and CD69 receptors, in the absence of
APC activation, is unsurprising [103]. This interaction would appear to be of considerable
pathogenic importance in vivo and is now considered to be a major driver of
tissue damage in rheumatoid arthritis [104], which is of interest given the data implicating increased
CD8+ T cell activation levels and numbers as a
driver of tissue damage in AD as described above.

There is evidence to suggest that LPS also induces synthesis of
IFNγ by natural killer (NK) cells via a mechanism which does not appear to
involve TLR-4 activation on APCs [105], and there are replicated data indicating that the
presence of this antigen stimulates the proliferation of
CD56+ CD3− NK cells,
which appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD [106, 107]; reviewed in [108].

APOE plays a regulatory role in inflammatory signalling in APCs
and there is some evidence to suggest that the APOE ε4 allele is associated with higher levels of PIC production
by LPS-activated macrophages via upregulation of NF-κB transcription resulting
in increased levels of TNF-α and IL-1 with a concomitant reduction in IL-10,
which is of interest given the probable role of translocated LPS in the
aetiology of peripheral inflammation in AD discussed above [109, 110].

Cash and colleagues studied mice in which the endogenous
apoe gene was replaced, at the same locus,
by either the human APOE4 or APOE3 gene; compared with the APOE3 mice, the APOE4 ones
showed defective macrophagic efferocytosis, which is a process involving the
phagocytosis and immunologically silent clearance of dying and dead cells
[111]. This may have significant
pathological consequences given considerable data indicating that tissue
inflammation may result from the failure of this mechanism; impaired
efferocytosis is being increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of
autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases [112].

The presence of dysbiosis in AD patients, which seems to involve
increased Bacteroidetes, decreased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (including
decreased Bifidobacterium and Adlercreutzia genera) phyla compared with age- and
sex-matched controls [38], may also
contribute to the Th17/Treg imbalance reported in AD, as described above.
Several research teams have independently reported that the composition of the
microbiota plays a key role in determining the trajectory of activated naïve CD4
T cell differentiation along the Th17 or Treg pathways [113, 114]. It should be noted that there are few Th17 cells in lymph
nodes and the vast bulk of this T cell population resides in the intestinal
lamina propria and can home in to the blood and other peripheral tissues
following activation, and therefore can be a source of the systemically elevated
T cells of this type reported in AD [95, 115].
Intriguingly, there is also accumulating evidence suggesting that gut microbiota
profiles influence the DNA methylation patterns of T cells and other cellular
inhabitants in the blood, thereby determining, at least to some extent, the
inflammatory status of an individual [116].

This is a complex area and readers interested in pursuing this
matter are invited to consult an excellent and comprehensive review conducted by
Ye and fellow workers [117]. The
class of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) proteins plays a major role in regulating
intestinal immune system homeostasis, colonic inflammation and composition of
the microbiota, and therefore it is tempting to speculate that APOE ε4 allele status could be associated with
pathological changes in all these parameters; however, it must be stressed that
there is no evidence regarding this area in AD or indeed any other disease
[118].

Epigenetic Changes in Peripheral Mononuclear Blood Cells
There is evidence of epigenetic dysregulation in the T cells and
macrophages of AD patients compared with age- and sex-matched controls, with
increased expression of microRNA-155 (miR-155) being reported in T cells and
differential DNA methylation changes being observed in
CD14+ macrophages [119, 120]. These
findings could also potentially indicate a source of elevated peripheral
inflammation in AD as miR-155 is NF-κB sensitive and also acts to increase the
transcription of NF-κB, which in turn allows for increasing levels of
inflammation and PIC production by activated T cells in a positive feedback loop
[121, 122]. While the origin of increased
expression of miR-155 in AD is not known, one potential cause could be
translocated LPS which is documented to increase the expression of this molecule
in human peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMBCs) most notably macrophages
[123].

There is also an accumulating body of evidence implicating
epigenetic dysregulation, most notably increased DNA methylation and altered
miRNA expression, with an elevated inflammatory status of macrophages
[124, 125]. For example, Wang and colleagues
reported that obesity-induced hypermethylation of DNA in the promoter region of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1 (PPARγ1) exacerbated the
inflammatory status of macrophages and provoked a polarisation towards the M1
phenotype [124]. These findings
were also reported by Yang and fellow workers in an earlier study [126]. miRNA profiles and levels also regulate
the inflammatory status and polarisation of macrophages via several different
mechanisms including NF-κB transcription and cellular location [127, 128].

APOE allele status is a major
influence on miRNA expression patterns in macrophages [125]. These authors reported that 152 miRNAs
were differentially expressed in murine macrophages over-expressing ApoE4
compared with those over-expressing ApoE3. The differential elevation of
mir-146a and miR-21 may be significant as they are associated with increased
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) production and a corresponding increase in
macrophage-associated tissue damage [125]. The upregulation of miR-146a may be of particular
pathological relevance as this molecule may be upregulated by IL-1β, TNF-α or
LPS, and increased activity of this miRNA is associated with increases in the
activity of numerous inflammatory pathways in AD (reviewed in [129]).

Influence of TREM-2 Elevation in PMBCs
TREM-2, although better known as a regulator of microglial
function as will be discussed below, also regulates TLR responses on dendritic
cells. TREM2 upregulation in such cells
appears to accelerate their maturation and trafficking to lymph nodes and sites
of infection, as well as stimulating the differentiation of Th2 or Th17 cells,
dependent on the nature and concentration of the antigen presented [130, 131]. The fact that TREM-2 acts as an ApoE receptor may also be
of importance as this allows for an exaggerated effect of the ApoE4 protein in
the context of dysfunctional TREM-2 receptors [132]. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis reported that increased
methylation of the TREM2 promoter region
appears to be an invariant feature in the brains of AD patients independently of
age and sex [64]. Moreover, this
increase in methylation is associated with a higher level of TREM-2 activity in
the brains of AD patients compared with healthy controls [69]. Increased expression of TREM-2 receptors
on peripheral leucocytes of AD and MCI patients, associated with reduced
methylation in TREM2 intron 1, has been
consistently reported [133–135]. Tan and colleagues have investigated the relationship
between increased expression of TREM2 mRNA in
the periphery in AD patients, and their study appears worthy of particular
consideration as their results appear to emphasise the importance of peripheral
abnormalities in the development of neuropathology in AD and partly to explain
the relationship [135]. Briefly,
these authors reported highly significant negative correlations (controlling for
age, sex, ethnicity and APOE allele status)
between, on the one hand, TREM2 mRNA
expression (following amplification by real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR)), and, on the other hand, MMSE score residuals, episodic memory
score residuals and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score residuals; there
was also a negative correlation with right hippocampal volume and with the grey
matter (GM) volumes of the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices [135]. Their analyses also revealed that,
following a median split according to MoCA scores, compared with controls those
AD patients in the lower group (MoCA scores ≤ 20) had higher TREM2 mRNA expression, which correlated with reduced
volumes of total GM and right and left hippocampi [135].

Effect of PP2A Inhibition
Finally, it is also noteworthy that PP2A inhibition, which also
appears to be a universal feature in AD patients [29], may lead to exacerbated PIC production by LPS-activated
APCs [136, 137]. The mechanism underpinning this
phenomenon has not been fully delineated but it appears to be associated with
altered levels of histone post-translational methylation leading to increased
transcription of TNFA (the TNF-α gene) and a
general increase in inflammatory status [137]. These findings, allied to those discussed above, may well
be important from the perspective of AD pathogenesis as the association between
peripherally increased PICs and TREM-2 and increased AD risk and/or severity
could be explained by the initiation and/or exacerbation of microglial
activation, either as a result of high peripheral PIC levels and/or the egress
of activated Th1 and/or Th17 cells into the CNS. Readers interested in the
details of the mechanisms involved are referred to these reviews by Morris and
colleagues [138] [139]. The pathological consequences of
microglial activation and dysfunction and the putative role of these glial cells
in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of AD are discussed below.

Role of Microglia and Astrocytes
It should be stated at the outset that much of the data regarding the
role of microglia in AD has been obtained from in vitro and non-human animal studies
or AD patients post mortem, and their role is still a source of debate [140]. However, the use of in vivo neuroimaging
techniques has consistently revealed a pattern of microglial activation consistent
with an increased inflammatory status. For example, Parbo and colleagues reported
the presence of increased cortical microglial activation in 85% of their MCI cohort
[141]. Moreover, these authors noted
that the patterns and extent of microglial activation correlated with the patterns
and level of amyloid load in the parietal, frontal and temporal cortices
[141]. Fan and co-workers also
reported significantly elevated microglial activation at baseline in their AD
participants, which increased in the majority of the patients over the course of the
study [21]. Moreover, these authors
reported that this longitudinal increase in microglial activation correlated with
amyloid deposition and decline in regional cerebral metabolic rate over time
[21]. In a later study, this team of
authors investigated longitudinal changes in microglial activity in MCI and AD
patients and reported a 36% increase in microglial activation over 14 months in the
AD patients but an 18% decrease in the MCI patients for reasons which are not
currently understood [20].

These findings are consistent with those of the work of other authors
who have produced evidence suggesting that such microglial activation and subsequent
production of cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, reactive
oxygen species (ROS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2), and other mediators of inflammation and neurotoxicity also play a critical
role in AD pathogenesis [142–144]. The weight of evidence suggests that microglia enter a
hyper-reactive state in AD, and indeed other neurodegenerative conditions, and lose
their normal beneficial function in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and phagocytic
clearance during the progression of the illness [145], and ultimately adopt a neurotoxic or ‘primed’ phenotype
[71, 146]. It has been proposed that this primed or hyper-responsive
phenotype, which leads to an exaggerated production of neurotoxic substances
following inflammatory activation, is the result of successive immune or
inflammatory insults in the periphery [22, 147]. The
activation of microglia, and the ultimate creation of a hyper-responsive phenotype,
would also go some way to explaining the wealth of experimental data demonstrating
that systemic inflammation, such as that resulting from pathogen invasion, can
worsen the symptoms of AD or even trigger its development [142]. Unsurprisingly, there has been intensive
research investigating the mechanisms underpinning microglial pathology in AD and
currently, a great deal of research is focused on TREM-2, which is considered
below.

Abnormalities in TREM-2 Levels and Function as a Source of Microglial
Pathology
As mentioned above, a recent meta-analysis concluded that increased
methylation of the TREM2 promoter region
appears to be an invariant feature in the brains of AD patients independently of
age and sex [64]; furthermore, this
increase in methylation is associated with a higher level of TREM-2 activity in
the brains of AD patients compared with healthy age- and sex-matched controls
[69]. Moreover, there is a wealth
of data demonstrating that functional variants of the TREM2 gene are strongly associated with an increased risk of late
onset AD (LOAD) development [148,
149].

Increased TREM-2 activity in AD brains may be a significant source
of pathology as this receptor plays a major role in regulating microglial
activation and the inflammatory response following TLR activation, and facilitates
immunologically silent phagocytosis of apoptotic neurones [150, 151]. Increased TREM2
expression in the temporal cortex of AD patients post mortem correlates
significantly with increases in caspase-3 and phosphorylated-tau, and intense
TREM-2 immunoreactivity is seen in microglia associated with amyloid plaques in
regions of profound neuritic pathology [152]. This and other data have led to the proposal that TREM2 variants contribute to the development of
Alzheimer’s disease via the downregulation of microglial Aβ phagocytic capability
and dysregulation of microglial pro-inflammatory responses [151]. The relationship between TREM-2 and the
development of a neuroinflammatory state appears to be complex and appears to
involve improving microglial survival and metabolic performance as well as
stimulating the release of PICs, ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and PGEs
[60]. There is also some evidence
to suggest that increasing levels of neuroinflammation provoke further
upregulation of the TREM-2 receptor on activated microglia allowing for an upwards
spiral of inflammation via a positive feedback loop [153]. In addition, TREM-2 acts as an ApoE
receptor [132], as discussed above,
and in this context, it is noteworthy that recent studies have established a
relationship between TREM-2 and ApoE in the regulation of the microglial phenotype
and the level of inflammatory mediators excreted by these glial cells following
activation [154, 155]. In particular, evidence suggests that
ApoE-mediated TREM-2 signalling provokes a change in microglial phenotype from
tolerogenic to neurodegenerative following phagocytosis of apoptosed neurones in
vivo [154] and the presence of the
ApoE4 isoform is associated with higher levels of neuroinflammation in such
circumstances by differentially increasing levels of TREM-2 [155].

TREM-2 activity is also intimately connected with microglial
phagocytosis as discussed above and exerts its signalling effects via a
multi-receptor complex with signalling adaptor molecule DNAX-activating protein of
12 kDa (DAP12) and dysfunction of this signalling axis may play a role in the
impaired microglial phagocytosis repeatedly reported in AD brains. Briefly, under
physiological conditions, heat shock protein-90 (HSP-90) engagement with TREM-2
regulates the immunologically silent microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic neurones
via engagement with DAP12 [152]. The
protective effect of TREM-2 against the development of LPS-mediated
neuroinflammation would also appear to be mediated by this route [156]. Given such information, the existence of
data suggesting that functional mutations in either protein can have adverse
effects on microglial phenotype and function is unsurprising and may be one factor
accounting for the impaired microglial phagocytosis which appears to be a feature
of AD [157, 158].

The physical association between TREM-2 and DAP12 plays a vital
role in determining the outcome of TREM-2 activation and in particular
anti-inflammatory consequences are dependent on DAP12-mediated stabilisation of
the C-terminal fragment of TREM-2 (CTF) and the loss of physical contact has
pro-inflammatory consequences [156].
This is of importance as there is evidence to suggest that CTF accumulation in AD
leads to disconnection between TREM-2 and DAP12, which could provide a mechanism
to explain impaired phagocytosis and the pro-inflammatory consequences of
TREM-2/DAP12 signalling in AD and a range of other neurodegenerative diseases
[158–160].

Epigenetic Dysregulation of ANK1 as a Source of Microglial
Pathology
The pivotal role of microglial pathology in the pathogenesis of AD
has been further highlighted by research into the methylation status of the gene
ANK1, the expression of which in AD brains in
vivo appears to be confined to these glial cells [61]. Briefly, two independent research teams have reported the
presence of a hypermethylated region in ANK1
and changes in ANK1 mRNA levels are associated
with the geographical extent and overall burden of neuropathology in the
entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus in symptomatic
and pre-symptomatic AD patients in post mortem studies [65, 66]. These are important observations: they are relatively large
studies and the methylation changes seen in asymptomatic patients are unlikely to
be the product of disease pathology [161]. It should also be noted that the association between AD
pathology and ANK1 methylation status may well
be the most robust of all epigenetic and genetic associations with disease
development reported thus far [61,
161].

The mechanisms underpinning this association are not understood,
but they may be connected to altered expression of miR-486. ANK1 is a host gene for miR-486 [162] which in turn is a source of two mature
miR-486 miRNAs, namely, miR-486-3p and miR-486-5p [163]. Importantly, ANK1
hypermethylation inhibits the transcription of miR-486 [164], which may have pathogenic consequences as
suppression of this miRNA has pro-inflammatory consequences and is furthermore
associated with increased cellular survival and proliferation [165, 166]. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-486 acts as a negative
regulator of Akt (protein kinase B), mTOR and STAT3 (signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3), all of which play major roles in microglial
activation, proliferation and survival [167, 168].

mTOR plays a pivotal role in determining the inflammatory status
and proliferation of microglia following PIC-mediated activation, which are both
key determinants of neuroinflammation [169]. Akt upregulation is also a major driver of microglial
activation and polarisation into the M1 phenotype [170]. STAT3 activation also plays a major role in determining the
magnitude of the proliferative and inflammatory responses of activated microglia
and, crucially, activation of this transcription factor also inhibits the
microglial phagocytosis and clearance of Aβ in vivo [171, 172]; reviewed by [173]. Thus, it is conceivable that ANK1 hypermethylation accounts for the elevated mTOR and STAT3
signalling which has been repeatedly documented in the microglia of AD patients
[172, 174–176].

Role of Aβ in Microglial Pathology
This is a well-documented area and has been considered by numerous
authors (e.g. [15, 177]). It seems reasonable to propose that
accumulating levels of Aβ as a result of impaired clearance would also play a role
in maintaining microglia in a chronic state of activation following antigenic
stimulation via engagement with TLR-2, which mediates antigenic stimulation of
these glial cells by this peptide [178]. However, the capacity of Aβ to activate microglia in vivo
has not been demonstrated and several authors have noted that human brains with
very high Aβ loads reveal an absence of microglial activation [140, 179].

Interactions Between Microglia and Astrocytes and Exacerbated
Neuroinflammation
Early AD is characterised by astroglial atrophy leading to impaired
blood-brain barrier (BBB) structure and function, synaptic dysfunction,
mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired neuronal homeostasis [180–182]. Later disease is associated with reactive
astrogliosis where activated astrocytes make an independent contribution to
increasing neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity [180, 181].
Astrocytes make many contributions towards brain homeostasis in the context of AD,
including regulation of oxygen and energy delivery to neurones, regulation of
cholesterol delivery to neurones, neurotransmission, and immune and inflammatory
responses in the CNS, in a similar manner to its activity in the periphery
discussed above [182]. This is
highly relevant because astrocytes are by far and away the largest producers of
ApoE in the brain and ApoE4 is known to impair BBB function to a greater extent
than other ApoE isoforms [183,
184]. Activated astrocytes are
also a source of Aβ42 protofibrils, likely synthesised by
the actions of PICs [185,
186]. There is also some evidence
that reactive astrocytes in AD not only secrete increased levels of
Aβ42 as discussed above but also conspire with adjacent
neurones to promote further increases in Aβ42 and levels of
ptau over a wider geographical area as the disease progresses [187].

There are a number of mechanisms which could account for the
greater levels of peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation that occurs in AD
patients than in age- and sex-matched controls, which in turn appear to make a
significant contribution to the development of AD, and it is certainly plausible
that the development of AD begins with pathology in the periphery. It should also
be noted that, while the data reviewed above focus heavily on inflammation, this
phenomenon is invariably accompanied by oxidative stress [188, 189]. Hence, the mechanisms potentially explaining differentially
elevated inflammation in the brain and periphery of AD patients also potentially
explain elevated oxidative stress in both compartments. This is an important point
as the remainder of the paper focuses on the third research question, namely,
whether differentially elevated inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain and
periphery of AD patients is sufficient to explain impaired mitochondrial function,
synaptic dysfunction, PPA2 inhibition, elevated mTOR, elevated GSK-3, impaired
macro- and microautophagy, decreased proteasome function, increased iron
accumulation and transition metal dyshomeostasis reported in AD patients compared
with age- and sex-matched controls.

Evidence and Consequences of Chronic Oxidative Stress in AD
Evidence of Increased Oxidative Stress in the Brain and Periphery in AD
Patients
Surrogate markers of protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and
oxidative damage to DNA, such as protein carbonyls, 3-nitrotyrosine,
malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal, F2-isoprostanes,
8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-hydroxyguanosine, are elevated in the
cerebrospinal fluid, the brain and peripheral cells of patients with AD
[16, 190, 191]. Damaged proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA in regions of the
brain associated with cognitive function are also a reproducible finding in AD and
MCI and are held to have a functional role in disease pathogenesis [192, 193].

Effect of Oxidative Stress on the Development of Amyloid and Tau
Pathology
Oxidative stress not only impairs the activity of α-secretase but
also enhances the activation and expression of β- and γ-secretase [194, 195]. The oxidative stress-driven stimulation of β-secretase 1
(BACE1) and presenilin-1 (PS1) activities, and the activation of γ-secretase, are
dependent on the NF-κB and activator protein 1 (AP-1)-induced activation of the
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway [196, 197]. In
essence, the promoter region of the BACE1 gene
hosts binding sites for the redox-sensitive AP-1 and NF-κB; the activation of
which in an environment of chronic oxidative stress explains the enhanced
transcription of BACE1 [198], elevated JNK signalling [16], increased expression of BACE1 and increased PS1 activity, which have been
detected in AD brains [199–201]. Hence, NF-κB- and AP-1-induced activation of JNK
signalling, and consequent upregulation of BACE1 and PSEN1 (which encodes
PS1), likely could lead to increased Aβ production and possibly an exacerbation of
cognitive decline and neuronal apoptosis in AD [16, 200].

There is also an accumulating body of evidence indicating that
chronic oxidative stress has a direct causal role in tau phosphorylation
[202–204]. The
mechanisms underpinning these observations remain to be fully elucidated but the
weight of evidence implicates elevated levels of fatty acids and p38 signalling
[204–206].

Other Pathological Consequences of Elevated Oxidative Stress
Signs of oxidative and nitrosative damage to proteins and lipids
are amongst the earliest indicators of early disease and occur before evidence of
Aβ accumulation [28]. A study
comparing F2-isoprostane levels in the frontal poles of AD
brains with the same regions from brains of patients with schizophrenia and
Parkinson’s disease (PD) reported no differences between PD, schizophrenia and
controls, but the levels were significantly increased in AD which potentially
allows for higher levels of oxidative stress in those brain areas as a unique
contribution to the pathogenesis of the illness [207].

Oxidative stress has also been associated with APOE status in AD patients and interestingly also in
healthy subjects [28]. In particular,
the APOE ε4-positive status is associated with
a relatively higher level of oxidative stress and diminished antioxidant enzyme
activity in the hippocampus of AD patients [208]. The association with APOE status is not surprising as ApoE is a key player in organising
cellular antioxidant responses [209]. The levels of oxidative stress in peripheral lymphocytes are
also higher in AD patients with at least one copy of the APOE ε4 allele [210].
It is also of interest that APOE ε4 directly
facilitates the phosphorylation of tau, potentially increasing the filamentous
load of this protein in the brain in AD [211].

Oxidative Stress and the Development of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in AD
Patients
Extensive studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction
is an important factor involved in the pathogenesis of AD and is apparent in the
earliest stages of the disease both in the brain and the periphery [19, 212]. Several studies have identified structural and functional
mitochondrial abnormalities in hippocampal neurones of AD patients compared with
age- and sex-matched controls [213–216]. Such abnormalities include a significant reduction in
mitochondrial numbers and exaggerated levels of oxidised mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
and nitrated proteins in the cytoplasm in a pattern suggestive of impaired
mitophagy or fission dynamics [215–217]. These mitochondrial abnormalities are accompanied by
oxidative damage marked by 8-hydroxyguanosine and nitrotyrosine, indicating that
the mitochondria are damaged by ROS and RNS during disease progression
[213, 218, 219].

Several authors have reported decreased mitochondrial complex IV
activity in the frontal cortex of AD patients and this phenomenon leads to
increased ROS production and depleted adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production,
contributing to neuronal dysfunction and, ultimately, degeneration [213, 214, 217]. Systemic
mitochondrial dysfunction is also apparent in all phases of the illness, as
evidenced by impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity and
depleted basal mitochondrial membrane potential, seen in PMBCs of patients with AD
and MCI [220–222]. In this
context, it is noteworthy that high levels of NO have a well-documented inhibitory
effect on ETC enzymes as a result of S-nitrosylation of key functional cysteine residues in their catalytic
sites (reviewed in [223]). Oxidative
and nitrosative stress can also lead to oxidative damage to key enzymes of the
tricarboxylic acid (Kreb’s) cycle, leading to their inactivation, which exerts a
range of unfavourable effects on cellular bioenergetics. These are well documented
phenomena and will not be considered further here. The interested reader is
referred to the works of Morris, Maes and Praticò [207, 224] for
details of these mechanisms. It is, however, worthy of note that mitochondrial
dysfunction leads to dramatically elevated levels of ROS and NO production, which
further compromise mitochondrial function, leading to a vicious spiral of
mitochondrial damage and bioenergetics failure [225, 226].

There is accumulating evidence that APOE status has an effect on mitochondrial function in at least some
patients with AD. Gibson and colleagues reported that mitochondrial dysfunction
was more common in the brains of AD patients with the APOE ε4 allele [227].
The mechanisms explaining this association are not completely understood but there
is some evidence to suggest that the neurotoxicity stems at least in part from the
entry of ApoE4 isoform fragments into the cytosol and ultimately into
mitochondrial membranes [184]. Once
in situ, this lipoprotein induces mitochondrial dysfunction by binding to the α-
and β-subunits of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase and disrupting mitochondrial
membrane integrity leading to dissipation of the trans-membrane potential
difference [184, 191]. There is also some evidence that the
APOE ε4 allele and mtDNA haplogroups are
cooperative variables in the sporadic form of AD [228].

In addition, accumulating data indicate that changes in methylation
status of the promoter region of the APOE gene
in AD patients can have a direct influence on mitochondrial function and indeed
the development of mitochondrial pathology [67, 68]. In brief,
the methylation status of a CGI in the 3′ region, 2.6 kb downstream of the
APOE promoter, modulates APOE expression. Moreover, common APOE SNPs reside in this region and can regulate levels
of methylation and transcription in an allele-specific manner with ε4 having a
greater effect than ε3. These methylation changes not only influence the
transcription of APOE but also affect that of
TOMM40 encoding the mitochondrial protein
translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40), which plays an
essential role in the importation of proteins into the organelle [67, 68]. This is significant given that a recent study has reported
reduced levels of TOMM40 in the brains of AD patients which correlated with the
extent of cognitive decline [229]
and the results of a large meta-analysis involving 10,358 AD cases and 18,157
healthy controls which concluded that the TOMM40
rs2075650 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of
disease development (odds ratio 4.178) [230]. The mechanisms underpinning reduced TOMM40 expression
and/or conformational changes to this protein and the development of AD and other
neurodegenerative diseases are discussed by Gottschalk and colleagues
[231]. Lastly, there is evidence
that mitochondrial dysfunction might be worsened by neuronal accumulation of
oligomeric Aβ (OAβ).

Oxidative Stress and the Development of Synaptic Dysfunction
Numerous research teams have adduced evidence supporting a direct
causal relationship between oxidative stress and the development of synaptic
dysfunction in AD [232]; reviewed by
[233]. This is also true of
mitochondrial dysfunction and glucose hypometabolism which is apparent in the
posterior cingulate cortex and other AD-vulnerable brain regions in MCI patients and
healthy adult carriers of APOE ε4 many years or
even decades before the development of clinical symptoms and, crucially, before any
discernible evidence of tau or Aβ pathology [234, 235]; reviewed
by [236]. The origin of glucose
hypometabolism, which appears to be an invariant feature in the brains of AD
patients [40], is a subject of debate
with some authors suggesting that this phenomenon is secondary to mitochondrial
dysfunction [44] while others cite as
the cause of brain insulin resistance, which is also an invariant feature in AD
patients [41]. It is also of interest
that the insulin resistance seen in AD patients could be the result of chronic
oxidative stress [45, 237], indirectly associating chronic oxidative
stress with the development of glucose hypometabolism [238, 239].

The association between impaired mitochondrial performance and the
development of synaptic dysfunction is not unexpected as these organelles are
involved in every stage of neurotransmission including the synthesis and storage of
neurotransmitters, the trafficking and recycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs),
presynaptic neurotransmitter release, neurotransmitter synthesis, calcium ion
homeostasis as well as supplying ATP and regulating levels of ROS [240–242].

Mechanisms underpinning the detrimental effects of excessive ROS
levels on synaptic function are underpinned by oxidation of cytosolic and membrane
proteins and peroxidation of membrane lipids [243, 244]. For
example, several research teams have reported that lipid peroxidation in presynaptic
membranes impedes fusion pore opening, thereby restricting SV exocytosis, resulting
in the abnormal retention of SVs within presynaptic active zones [245, 246]. The last phenomenon may go some way to explaining the
presence of data demonstrating attenuation of synaptic neurotransmission and
long-term potentiation (LTP) by high levels of ROS (reviewed by [247]).

More specifically, increasing levels of ROS and RNS could account for
the progressive loss of cholinergic neurones and increasing dysfunction of
cholinergic neurotransmission which are characteristic of AD patients as their
disease progresses [248]. For example,
the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the high-affinity choline
transporter (CHT), the enzymes responsible for synthesising and recycling
acetylcholine (ACh), respectively, are vulnerable to post-translational
modifications leading to compromised trafficking and protein-protein interactions or
indeed inactivation by the effects of ROS and ROS owing to a high density of
essential cysteine residues in enzyme catalytic sites (reviewed by [249]). Moreover, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an
enzyme responsible for ACh hydrolysis in the synaptic cleft, is also prone to
inhibition in such an environment [250, 251]. Furthermore,
there is a considerable body of evidence indicating that cholinergic neurones are
highly susceptible to apoptotic or necrotic death in an environment of excessive
nitrosative and oxidative stress [252,
253] via mechanisms detailed in a
recent paper by Morris and fellow workers [139]. Readers interested in a detailed consideration of cholinergic
neurotransmission and the role of the molecular players described above in the
context of AD are invited to consult an excellent review by Ferreira-Vieira and
fellow workers [248].

The existence of synaptic dysfunction in AD may also be influenced by
inhibition of glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which has been
repeatedly reported in AD patients [254], via oxidation of cysteine groups on key structural and
functional proteins leading to profound changes in conformation and function
[223, 255]. NMDA receptor function can also be
compromised by high levels of NO through hypernitrosylation of key receptor subunits
[226] and via the formation of the
excessively damaging peroxynitrite [256].

While the association between increased oxidative stress and
increasing bioenergetic dysfunction, as evidenced by increasing glucose
hypometabolism, increased lactate and pyruvate and the development of increasing
synaptic dysfunction seen in preclinical AD and APOE ε4 carriers, is not associated with Aβ accumulation [257] (reviewed by [258]), recent research suggests that this might
not be the case for tau deposition although findings are mixed [259–261]. For example, Bischof and others and Kang et
al. reported a positive correlation between tau deposition and glucose
hypometabolism in cross-sectional studies [259, 261]. However,
Chiotis and colleagues concluded that increases in glucose hypometabolism were not
associated with increased tau deposition in a large longitudinal study [260].

Increased Oxidative Stress and Altered GSK-3 Activity in AD
Patients
Prolonged and severe oxidative stress leads to the activation of
GSK-3 [262–264]; its
physiological levels of expression and activity play an indispensable role in the
regulation of synaptic function and other aspects of neurotransmission as well as
levels of tau phosphorylation [12,
265]. Given this information, the
presence of data implicating dysregulation in the activity of the two isoforms of
this kinase as one cause of synaptic dysfunction in MCI and AD is unsurprising
(reviewed by [266]).

The weight of direct and indirect evidence suggests that GSK-3
production is increased in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of AD patients
[267, 268] and in post-synaptosomal supernatants
derived from AD brain [269]. Active
GSK-3 also appears in neurones before the development of NFTs and it co-localises
with dystrophic neurites and NFTs in later stages of the disease [269–271]. GSK-3 is also upregulated in peripheral
lymphocytes in MCI and AD [272]. The
importance of GSK-3 in the pathogenesis of AD has been emphasised by reports that a
GSK3B polymorphism is a significant risk factor
for the development of LOAD [273].
Both isoforms of GSK-3 (GSK-3β and GSK-3α) appear to induce the hyperphosphorylation
of tau [274, 275], but GSK-3α alone regulates the cleavage of
APP and would appear to exert this role in the very early phase of the disease
[276–278]. However,
increased GSK-3β signalling also seems to play a pathological role in amyloid
processing as such signalling increases BACE1
expression, thereby facilitating the increased production of Aβ [279]. Conversely, and unsurprisingly, inhibition
of this enzyme leads to a reduction in Aβ production [279]. There is evidence that GSK-3α enhances the
activity of the γ-secretase complex [277] and may act to downregulate the activity of α-secretase
[280]. There is also accumulating
evidence, albeit in vitro, demonstrating that ApoE4 increases GSK3B expression, potentially leading to the exacerbation
of pathology associated with the activation and upregulation of this kinase
[281, 282].

Oxidative Stress mTOR Activation and Impaired Autophagy and UPS
Clearance
Background
Autophagy encompasses a series of pathways by which damaged
cytosolic components are transferred to lysosomes and subjected to enzymatic
degradation in an immunologically silent manner (reviewed in [283]). There are three recognised subgroups of
autophagy, namely macroautophagy, the dominant form in human cells, microautophagy
and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Readers interested in a detailed examination of
these processes and the differences and similarities between them are referred to
a comprehensive review by Yu and others [284]. The UPS, on the other hand, is based on the receipt of
ubiquitin-tagged oxidatively damaged and/or misfolded proteins by the
barrel-shaped 26S proteasome, composed of multiple protein subunits, via a narrow
opening (see [285]). Once ensconced,
such proteins are subjected to a range of proteolytic enzymes, ultimately
producing ubiquitin-tagged monomers [286].

The autophagic process is upregulated in the brains of AD patients,
most notably in the hippocampus and other areas of the brain associated with AD
pathology [287]. These observations
may be significant in terms of differentiating AD from normal ageing, as there is
copious evidence that the autophagic process is downregulated in normal ageing
[288, 289]. However, despite the transcriptional
upregulation of autophagy seen in AD patients, the weight of evidence indicates
that autophagic lysosomal clearance is dysregulated and defective in the
hippocampus of AD patients, even in those in the very early stages of their
disease [287] [24].

The activity of the UPS is also impaired in the hippocampus and
other disease-susceptible brain regions in AD patients, but apparently not in
brain regions not associated with AD-specific neurodegenerative pathology
(reviewed by [285, 286]). It would also appear that changes in the
protein composition of the 26S proteasome and impaired activity of ubiquitin
C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme responsible for the
production of ubiquitin-tagged monomers, may be a characteristic of AD
[290, 291]. From the perspective of this paper, it is
especially noteworthy that downregulation of this enzyme appears to be the result
of oxidative damage and occurs in AD patients many years before any evidence of
amyloid plaques or NFTs [286,
291].

Oxidative Stress and mTOR Activity in AD
mTOR is recognised as one of the master regulators of cellular
metabolism in general and in autophagic processes in particular [292]. Readers interested in the many
homeostatic roles, biochemistry and mechanistic actions of the two mTORC (mTOR
complex) isoforms are referred to excellent reviews by Laplante and Sabatini
[293, 294].

The weight of evidence suggests that mTOR activity is increased in
the temporal cortex and hippocampus of AD patients [295, 296], and an activated but dysregulated Akt/mTOR signalling
pathway in the hippocampus would appear to be a universal feature of AD and MCI
(reviewed by [297]). It is
noteworthy that MTOR expression is normally
increasingly inhibited in the ageing brain [298, 299], and
hence the existence of elevated mTOR activity in the hippocampus of AD patients
could be a factor underpinning dysfunctional autophagic lysosomal clearance in
that region of the brain, as discussed above. From the wider perspective of AD
pathology, mTOR has several roles, such as the regulation of many aspects of
synaptic function and protein aggregation, and is known to promote ptau and tau
dyshomeostasis [300–303]. Some authors also propose that intricate molecular
interactions between Aβ, tau and mTOR exacerbate the rate of cognitive decline
[304, 305]. Elevated mTOR signalling is also relevant
from the perspective of the more ‘generic’ elements involved in disease
pathogenesis as this kinase regulates mitochondrial function [306], immune cell homeostasis [307] and levels of oxidative stress
[308]. It is also of interest that
mTOR activity in AD does not appear to be modified by APOE allele status, which hints that this molecule could play a
unique role in AD pathology which is not seen in normal ageing [300].

Oxidative Stress and Compromised UPS Function and Structure
Initially, increased levels of oxidative stress provoke a defensive
response whereby the 26S proteasome dissociates into its 20S and 19S subunits,
with the former being resistant to oxidative damage and thus responsible for
protein degradation in this changed environment [309–311]. This adaptive response has limitations
however, and during the development of chronic oxidative stress, the 20S subunit
as well as the 26S proteasome may also become deactivated [309, 312], leading to the accumulation of insoluble covalently
crosslinked proteins which can further inhibit the proteasome [310, 313]. Proteasomal dysfunction can lead to decreased degradation
of misfolded proteins, thus resulting in accumulation of oxidised proteins and
subsequent protein aggregation. Protein aggregates can then feedback, further to
inhibit proteasomal activities, generate additional cellular stress and lead to
cytotoxicity [309, 310, 314]. Additionally, oxidatively modified proteins may impair the
cellular machinery of autophagic degradation [314, 315]. Reactive
species can damage the lysosomal membrane and crosslinked membrane proteins,
resulting in cytosolic leakage of lysosomal hydrolases [315, 316].

When considered as a whole, the data demonstrate that chronic
oxidative stress impairs autophagy by provoking unfavourable changes in autophagic
degradation, inhibition of lysosomal enzyme function and lysosomal membrane damage
[317]. Furthermore, some
oxidatively modified aggregated species are resistant to degradation by proteases
and accumulate within lysosomes. There, the non-degraded proteins become a
potential new source of reactive species, further damaging the lysosomal membrane
[318]. This oxidative damage to
lysosomal lipid membranes can be exacerbated by high levels of iron seen in AD
patients, which increase the sensitivity of these membranes to oxidative damage to
the point of inducing apoptotic or necrotic cell death resulting from lysosomal
rupture and release of toxic hydroxylases, calpains and redox-active iron into the
cytoplasm [139]. There is a growing
appreciation that the role of redox-active iron and iron dyshomeostasis as a
driver of neuropathology in AD may be pivotal in AD both as a source of increasing
oxidative stress, via hydroxyl production through the Fenton reaction, and in the
development of amyloid- and tau-related pathology. Hence, the role of oxidative
stress in the development of iron dyshomeostasis and accumulation in the brains of
AD patients and the pathological consequences of this phenomenon is the focus of
the remainder of this paper. Understanding the content below requires some
knowledge of the factors involved in maintaining iron homeostasis, which are
depicted in Fig. 3 and summarised in the
accompanying legend.Fig. 3 Iron homeostasis in neurones. Neurones and glial cells can
uptake iron bound to transferrin (TBI), or bound to other molecules such
as citrate and ATP secreted by astrocytes (NTBI). Neuronal uptake of TBI
is enabled by the transferrin receptor located at the cell membrane and
the uptake of NTBI in inflammatory conditions is probably enabled by DMT1.
DMT1 and TfR1 complexes are internalised via endocytosis, ultimately
resulting in the release of redox-active iron (Fe(II)) into the cytosol
and the return of other molecules in the complexes to the plasma membrane.
Once in the cytosol, Fe(II) can be utilised for various essential
metabolic processes such as the synthesis of iron-sulphur proteins, or
sequestrated by cytosolic ferritin and mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt),
which offers protection against the advent of the Fenton reaction. Iron is
removed from neurones by ferroportin, supported by the
multi-copper-containing ferroxidase caeruloplasmin and sAPP, which both
act to stabilise ferroportin at the cell surface



Oxidative Stress and Iron Accumulation in AD
Evidence of Iron Dyshomeostasis in AD Patients
Sophisticated MRI approaches have allowed the detection of
increased iron levels in the brains of AD patients, most notably in the putamen
and in posterior GM and white matter regions [319–321]. Elevated iron levels in the cortex and
cerebellum are also a commonly reported phenomenon in MCI patients [322]. Levels of intracellular iron are subject
to strict homeostatic regulation at the translational and transcriptional
levels.

Transcriptional Regulation of Iron Homeostasis
Regulation at the transcriptional level is mediated by interplay
between the iron transport exporter protein ferroportin-1 (fpn-1) and the peptide
hormone hepcidin, whereby increased activity of the latter leads to a reduction in
the activity and levels of the former, hence reducing the cellular export of iron
[323, 324]. Crucially, hepcidin synthesis is
upregulated in an environment of chronic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as
a result of elevated H2O2
[325] and/or IL-6-activated STAT3
[326–329]. In fact,
lower H2O2 concentrations (in the
range of the levels observed during inflammation) require STAT3 phosphorylation to
induce hepcidin and may, synergistically with IL-6, stimulate hepcidin
[325]. This is clearly one
mechanism underpinning the adverse effect of neuroinflammation and oxidative
stress on iron accumulation in the CNS. Several authors have also reported that
upregulation of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) on the surface of neurones and
glial cells results from the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NO by LPS-activated
microglia [330–332].
Importantly, the release of PICs from activated microglia, most notably IL-6, also
leads to increases of hepcidin and reduction of ferroportin in neurones, which
supplies a mechanism allowing increasing levels of neuronal iron accumulation over
time in an environment of neuroinflammation [330, 331,
333].

Regulation of Iron Homeostasis at the Translational Level
Regulation of iron homeostasis and the translational level are
governed by iron regulatory proteins (IRP) 1 and 2, which can bind to iron
response elements (IRE) in the 5′ or 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA
sequences responsible for the production of proteins involved in iron homeostasis.
This interplay is described as the IRP/IRE system (reviewed by [334]). The organisation and function of this
system is depicted in Fig. 4 and explained
in the accompanying legend.Fig. 4 Post-transcriptional control of iron homeostasis in neurones and
glial cells. Binding of IRP1 and IRP2 to IRE in the 5′-UTR of mRNAs
encoding ferritin and ferroportin represses translation, while binding of
IRP1 and IRP2 to IRE in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs encoding TfR1 and DMT1
stabilises the mRNA resulting in efficient translation. In an environment
of increasing oxidative stress, IRP2 is degraded while IRP1-mRNA binding
is enhanced, which inhibits the synthesis of ferritin, ferroportin and APP
while simultaneously upregulating the production DMT1 and TfR1. The
cumulative effect of these activities is significantly increased
iron



Detrimental Effect of Oxidative Stress on the IRP/IRE System
In an environment of increasing oxidative stress, IRP1 RNA binding
is enhanced which inhibits the synthesis of ferritin, ferroportin and APP while
concomitantly upregulating the production of DMT1 and transferrin receptor (TfR1)
[335]. The cumulative effects of
these activities are significantly increased iron uptake, a major reduction in
iron sequestration and increased uptake of transferrin-bound iron (TBI) and
non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) [335–339]. NO, and
indeed peroxynitrite, also increase the mRNA binding of IRP1-IRE sequences
[340, 341]. Elevated levels of NO also promote the
degradation of IRP2 via a number of mechanisms including S-nitrosylation of crucial cysteine residues [342, 343], leaving IRP1 as the sole IRP regulating iron levels in
brain cells in an environment of chronic oxidative and nitrosative stress. It is
also interesting to note that IRP1-IRE complexes appear to be the only active
complexes in the brains of AD patients [344]. In addition, it is noteworthy that recent findings indicate
that increased APP activity and aggressive Aβ deposition seen in AD patients
result, at least in part, from iron accumulation and dysfunctional IRP-IRE
signalling [345, 346]. The role of iron accumulation in
increased APP production is further highlighted by evidence demonstrating that
iron chelation selectively downregulates APP
mRNA production [347, 348].

Effect of Elevated Fe(III) and Fe(II) on the Development of Amyloid and Tau
Pathology
Effect on APP Processing
APP translation is regulated
by IL-1 activity and the IRE element in the 5′ UTR of APP mRNA. This IRE region interacts with IRP1 in human brain
cortical tissue [348, 349]. Therefore, increasing levels of iron
can stimulate the translation of APP by
provoking the dissociation of IRP1 as described above [348]. Hence, prolonged increases in neural
iron have the effect of increasing the amount of APP available for amyloidogenic
processing and Aβ production. In addition, elevated iron also reduces the
α-secretase cleavage of APP and favours proteolysis by β-secretase [350, 351]. Mechanistically, this phenomenon stems from the capacity
of iron to reduce the transcription of the proconvertase furin. Under
physiological conditions, furin initiates cleavage of A dysintegrin and
metalloproteases 10 (ADAM10) and TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) and increases
the activity of α-secretase and hence the production of α-secretase-derived
secreted form of APP (sAPPα) [352]. However, iron-induced suppression of furin transcription
enhances the activity of β-secretase activity, thereby stimulating the
amyloidogenic pathway and thus the production of Aβ1–42
[351, 353]. The plausibility of this mechanism in
vivo is further reinforced by evidence demonstrating that furin levels are
reduced in the brains of AD patients [352].

Effect of Elevated Fe(III) and Fe(II) on Amyloid Plaque
Formation
There is some evidence to suggest that the initial seeding of
Aβ42 plaques with Fe(III) may be beneficial by
facilitating the export of excessive insoluble iron via microglial phagocytosis
and subsequent lysosomal degradation [354]. However, several research teams have produced preclinical
data demonstrating that prolonged association of Fe(III) with
Aβ1–42 leads to the reduction of the former and
increased levels of redox-active Fe(II) [355, 356]. These
findings have been recently reproduced in vivo in cortical tissue of AD
transgenic mice [357].
Furthermore, these authors reported a direct correlation between elevated Fe(II)
levels resulting from the reduction of Fe(III) by Aβ1–42
and pathological changes in plaque morphology particularly with regard to the
protein/fibril density of fibrillar fragments and diffuse plaques [357]. The formation of Fe(II)/Aβ complexes in
AD patients is important from a pathological perspective as Fe(II) has the
capacity to interact with Aβ amino acids, subsequently conferring longitudinal
changes to the normal patterns of amyloid formations [358, 359]. In brief, the interactions between Fe(III) and Fe(II), on
the one hand, and APP and Aβ, on the other hand, influence the speed and extent
of Aβ aggregation into fibrillary structures [360, 361]. More
specifically, the weight of evidence suggests that when enough amyloid
deposition has occurred, toxic oligomeric formations can propagate in a
nonlinear amyloidogenic positive feedback loop, bypassing the normal requirement
for amyloid monomers to form dimers [362], thereby accelerating Aβ aggregation, oligomerisation and
amyloidogenesis [363, 364]. The role of iron in this process may be
of paramount importance as there is evidence to suggest that Aβ plaques may not
be neurotoxic in the absence of iron and that the oxidative and peroxidative
damage to proteins and lipids associated with Aβ stems from its high affinity
with iron and its capacity to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) thereby providing a
redox-active Aβ-iron complex capable of producing destructive hydroxyl radicals
in association with elevated hydrogen peroxide produced by soluble
Aβ1–42 [190] reviewed by [365]. The indispensable role of elevated Fe(II) and Fe(III) as
drivers of amyloid pathology is further supported by evidence obtained from
rodent models of AD demonstrating that iron chelation can prevent Aβ aggregation
and reverse memory loss [363,
366].

Effect of Elevated Fe(III) and Fe(II) on Tau Hyperphosphorylation and NFT
Formation
Fe(II) can induce tau hyperphosphorylation [367, 368] via a mechanism involving the activation of the MAPK
pathway and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) pathway
[369, 370]. This effect may be inhibited in vivo
via the use of the iron chelator deferoxamine [368, 371]. This
may induce a cascade of self-amplifying pathology as the hyperphosphorylation of
tau and the formation of NFTs in the brains of AD patients results in an
increased production of haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) [372, 373] which
provokes the release of Fe(II) [374], which may exacerbate ROS production via Fenton chemistry
[353, 375]. Increasing levels of ROS may also
explain the elevations in cytosolic copper and zinc seen in AD patients, which
would occur as a result of oxidation of binding-thiol groups in their
sequestration partner metallothionein [376, 377];
reviewed by [378]. It is also
noteworthy that high levels of oxidative stress in neurones would be expected to
inhibit PP2A [30, 379] and such inhibition could well add to
the neurotoxic milieu, as reduced PPA2 activity is associated with neuronal
death via a mechanism involving the activation of MAPK [380]. The pathological role of PP2A
inactivation in the neurones of advanced AD patients may well be underestimated
as there is evidence suggesting that impaired signalling of this phosphatase is
a major element underpinning the hyperphosphorylation of tau in Parkinsonian
dementia, often described as ‘a classical tauopathy’ [381].

The Function of the BBB in This Model
Several authors have reported reduced expression of adhesion
molecules and tight junction proteins in BBB endothelial cells combined with a
dysfunctional and/or disrupted neurovascular unit in AD patients with early disease
long before the occurrence of dementia and in the absence of neurodegeneration and
brain atrophy [382–384].
Importantly, such damage may result from the presence of prolonged systemic
inflammation and elevated levels of PICs, which increase the permeability of tight
junctions by decreasing levels of glycocalyx and other adhesion molecules, as well
as causing endothelial cell damage and disruption of the of glia limitans
[385, 386]. It is important to note that such damage
may result from PICs in the systemic circulation or following activation of
microglia and astrocytes in the brain and the latter phenomenon goes some way to
explaining the dysfunction of the neurovascular unit seen in early AD patients
described above [382, 385, 386].

Other Neurodegenerative Disorders
This peripheral model may help explain other neurodegenerative
disorders besides AD. Numerous in vivo studies have demonstrated a dysfunctional or
disrupted BBB and neurovascular unit in other neurological diseases such as PD
[387, 388]. This is of interest as a recent
meta-analysis has confirmed the presence of peripheral inflammation and elevated
PICs in PD patients [389]. Moreover,
the development of BBB disruption and the subsequent egress of activated T cells and
other lymphocytes into the CNS further exacerbating microglial activation have been
established as a causative factor in the pathogenesis of the illness [390]. The ultimate cause of chronic peripheral
inflammation in PD patients is not entirely understood and may be multifactorial.
However, it seems reasonable to conclude that pesticide exposure and perhaps a
history of head trauma may be involved, as both factors appear to play as a
causative role in the development of the illness [391, 392].

Conclusion
In conclusion, it has been shown that the presence of the APOE ε4 allele, and epigenetic dysregulation, including
increased DNA methylation and altered miRNA expression, could explain increased
levels of peripheral and central inflammation and oxidative stress in AD.
Furthermore, this increased oxidative stress and inflammation could originate in the
periphery rather than in the CNS itself. Finally, molecular neurobiological
mechanisms have been adduced which explain how the initial development of elevated
peripheral and central inflammation and oxidative stress in the context of genetic
and epigenetic abnormalities could explain the development of AD.
